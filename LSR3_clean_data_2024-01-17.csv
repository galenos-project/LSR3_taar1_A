HEREIN, WE EMPLOYED LUMINESCENCE COMPLEMENTATION TECHNOLOGY IN HETEROLOGOUS LIVE CELL SYSTEMS, CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY, VOLTAGE CLAMP ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL READOUTS AND TAAR1 KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE TO STUDY SEP-856 IN FURTHER DETAIL. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE ABILITY OF SEP-856 TO ACTIVATE TAAR1 AT THE SURFACE PLASMA MEMBRANE, AND SHOW THAT THIS INTERACTION RESULTS IN GΑS RECRUITMENT (PEC50: 6.08 ± 0.22 EMAX: 96.41% ± 15.26) AND BY EXTENSION, TO G-PROTEIN INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM (GIRK) CHANNEL ACTIVATION. USING TAAR1-KO MICE, WE FIND TAAR1 TO BE INDISPENSABLE FOR SEP-856 CONTROL OF BODY TEMPERATURE, BASELINE LOCOMOTION REDUCTION AND FOR “ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE” EFFICACY AS CHARACTERIZED BY A REVERSAL OF DIZOCILIPINE (MK-801) MEDIATED DISRUPTION OF PRE-PULSE INHIBITION. CONVERSELY, THE INHIBITION BY SEP-856 OF MK-801 INDUCED LOCOMOTION WAS UNAFFECTED IN TAAR1 KO MICE. SEP-856 BEHAVED AS A LOW-POTENCY, PARTIAL AGONIST AT THE 5-HT1A RECEPTOR, WHILE IT PARTIALLY INHIBITED RECRUITMENT OF D2 RECEPTOR-COUPLED GΑ AND GIRK BY DA AND ACTED AS A WEAK PARTIAL AGONIST WITH LOW POTENCY AT THE SAME RECEPTOR WHEN APPLIED ALONE. OUR FINDINGS CORROBORATE AND EXTEND PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS ON THE MOLECULAR SUBSTRATES ENGAGED BY THIS UNIQUE, DUAL TAAR1/5-HT1A RECEPTOR AGONIST AND POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC THAT COULD PROVE TO HAVE MAJOR ADVANTAGES IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND OTHER PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138022967&doi=10.1038%2fs41386-022-01421-2&partnerID=40&md5=ffe1e6f7a1199c44c07f1cd5e0bc19b3","United Kingdom","2022","10.1038/s41386-022-01421-2","ARTICLE","ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:DIZOCILPINE MALEATE:MICE:MICE, KNOCKOUT:RECEPTOR, SEROTONIN, 5-HT1A:RECEPTORS, DOPAMINE D2:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:SEROTONIN:DIZOCILPINE:DOPAMINE:DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR:G PROTEIN COUPLED INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM CHANNEL:G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR:HALOPERIDOL:SEP 383856:SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:ULOTARONT:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:DIZOCILPINE MALEATE:DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR:G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:SEROTONIN:SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ARTICLE:BODY TEMPERATURE:CELL MEMBRANE:CELLULAR DISTRIBUTION:CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG ACTIVITY:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG MECHANISM:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY:IN VITRO STUDY:IN VIVO STUDY:LIVE CELL IMAGING:LOCOMOTION:MOUSE:NONHUMAN:SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION:VOLTAGE CLAMP TECHNIQUE:ANIMAL:KNOCKOUT MOUSE:METABOLISM",NA,"2-S2.0-85138022967","2023-08-31 13:56:51","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","87890e5c-5da6-4669-9742-891aa2e43a82","Fiona Ramage","Animal","None specified","No","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological",NA,"MK-801","0.4","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"mg/kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,1,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,"Oral administration/gavage",NA,"Single dose",NA,"0.5",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","Minutes","Endpoint measurement","Ratio","TRUE","Mixed male and female","WT","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Exact number","999","3.5",NA,"2","5","Months","Weight not reported",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","2023-10-28 16:38:41","9c2985f1-bf11-4681-ad54-918705b46ec1","Hyperlocomotion","OFT - distance (MK-801)","f0b3984d-2f51-4d67-8c2e-24e610743ec6","06924b86-9755-47b4-a659-9d1f66e1d4d3","7","a586bbba-19f4-41df-9ad8-8766dbd91ef9","FALSE","MK-801","4dd481b3-7519-47c0-8fc2-9b9732a3b5a4",NA,"Simple intervention","SEP-856",NA,"Intervention",NA,"TRUE","0","109.78","Mean","Metres (m)","14.86","SEM","2cfb8de7-b0ad-416f-bfa4-a3771051dc1d.9c2985f1-bf11-4681-ad54-918705b46ec1.f0b3984d-2f51-4d67-8c2e-24e610743ec6.0","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","SEP-363856","SEP-363856","SEP-363856, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","SEP-363856",NA,"SEP-363856",NA,NA,NA,NA,"999",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OFT - distance (MK-801)","f0b3984d-2f51-4d67-8c2e-24e610743ec6","0ae94d6c-adc7-47b3-9175-2f8c2ee5dd01","7","f9c1c3a1-e6ca-40e2-9dc7-ad0f01ec64a4",NA,"Negative control","Vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"183.42","19.85","C","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,"30","999",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OFT - distance (MK-801)","Locomotor activity","f0b3984d-2f51-4d67-8c2e-24e610743ec6","87963ef4-0d77-4278-ace6-c0e957a39e20","7","True",NA,"Sham","108.44","9.04","S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP-363856, 10 mg/kg","TvC","MK-801 + vehicle (MK-801 locomotion)",7,183.42,19.85,52.5181635246321,"MK-801 + SEP-856 (MK-801 locomotion)",7,109.78,14.86,39.3158644824198,"WT control (MK-801 locomotion)",7,108.44,9.04,23.9175918520239,TRUE,1.48575367569811,0.36455228517323,98.2128567618032,70.0428961384798,52.4351353459854,33.0701650568641,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Mixed male and female","SEP-363856","Oral administration/gavage",10,"Locomotor activity",6.85,"TAAR1 full agonist","Low (5HT1A partial agonism)",183.27,0.14,5.96549275301923,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",14,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

BECAUSE TRACE AMINES ALSO INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER TARGETS, SELECTIVE LIGANDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ELUCIDATION OF TAAR1 FUNCTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY. BASED ON THE PRECLINICAL DATA AND ITS UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, SEP-856 IS A PROMISING NEW AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND REPRESENTS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS EXPECTED TO LACK THE SIDE EFFECTS STEMMING FROM BLOCKADE OF D2 SIGNALING.

SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY.

HERE, WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAAR1 HYPERSIGNALING BY GENERATING A TRANSGENIC MOUSE LINE OVEREXPRESSING TAAR1 SPECIFICALLY IN NEURONS. TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE DID NOT SHOW OVERT BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS, DESPITE AUGMENTED EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND NORADRENALINE IN THE ACCUMBENS NUCLEUS (ACB) AND OF SEROTONIN IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX. IN VITRO, THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH AN ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS FIRING RATE OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, AND LOCUS COERULEUS AS THE RESULT OF ECTOPIC TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE WERE HYPOSENSITIVE TO THE PSYCHOSTIMULANT EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, AS IT PRODUCED ONLY A WEAK LOCOMOTOR ACTIVATION AND FAILED TO ALTER CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE IN THE ACB. ATTENUATING TAAR1 ACTIVITY WITH THE SELECTIVE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5073012 RESTORED THE STIMULATING EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE ON LOCOMOTION. OVERALL, THESE DATA SHOW THAT TAAR1 BRAIN OVEREXPRESSION CAUSES HYPOSENSITIVITY TO AMPHETAMINE AND ALTERATIONS OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION. THESE OBSERVATIONS CONFIRM THE MODULATORY ROLE OF TAAR1 ON MONOAMINE ACTIVITY AND SUGGEST THAT IN VIVO THE RECEPTOR IS EITHER CONSTITUTIVELY ACTIVE AND/OR TONICALLY ACTIVATED BY AMBIENT LEVELS OF ENDOGENOUS AGONIST(S). © 2012 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867582955&doi=10.1038%2fnpp.2012.109&partnerID=40&md5=e7abdfcdba27720806ef10c9543e7a41","United Kingdom","2012","10.1038/npp.2012.109","ARTICLE","AMPHETAMINE:ANILINE COMPOUNDS:ANIMALS:BEHAVIOR, ANIMAL:BIOGENIC MONOAMINES:BRAIN CHEMISTRY:CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULANTS:DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS:ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PHENOMENA:GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID:IMIDAZOLES:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICRODIALYSIS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:PATCH-CLAMP TECHNIQUES:PHENOTYPE:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION:VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA:6 CYANO 7 NITRO 2,3 QUINOXALINEDIONE:AMPHETAMINE:CATECHOLAMINE:DOPAMINE:MEMBRANE RECEPTOR:NORADRENALIN:PSYCHOSTIMULANT AGENT:RO 5073012:RO 5166017:RO 5212773:SEROTONIN:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL CELL:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ARTICLE:ATTENUATION:BEHAVIOR DISORDER:BRAIN:CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE:CONTROLLED STUDY:DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG SENSITIVITY:EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX:GENE EXPRESSION:GENE OVEREXPRESSION:IN VITRO STUDY:IN VIVO STUDY:LOCOMOTION:LOCUS CERULEUS:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX:MONOAMINE NERVE CELL:MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEM:MOUSE:NERVE CELL:NEUROTRANSMISSION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS:PREFRONTAL CORTEX:PRIORITY JOURNAL:PROTEIN EXPRESSION:PROTEIN FUNCTION:PROTEIN LOCALIZATION:RAT:SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION:TRANSGENIC MOUSE:VENTRAL TEGMENTUM",NA,"2-S2.0-84867582955","2023-08-31 13:56:51","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","430e50f2-05a0-42d8-8149-997d25380a25","Emily Sena","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological",NA,"amphetamine","2.5","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"mg/kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,1,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,"Oral administration/gavage",NA,"Single dose",NA,"-0.5",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","Minutes","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","21","999","999","1001","999","Weeks","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","Yes","2023-11-07 10:49:02","bc4bd2ca-a9e1-4e08-9d59-29da5d6c381c","distance - Fig5c","total distance (Mean +/- SEM)","037f0b62-0731-4866-a3d4-7aace09ec61b","631f9fcb-0d88-4478-b355-c83875c3319e","21","493af0c6-d00a-49e5-8246-aa983f78f577","FALSE","AMPH","8bd7c0de-30d5-4cbf-ba13-005ac294f443",NA,"Simple intervention","RO5073012",NA,"Intervention",NA,"TRUE","1","15368.5","Mean","cm","1456.5","SEM","75d0fb62-e1b1-443f-8419-73d67886a28d.bc4bd2ca-a9e1-4e08-9d59-29da5d6c381c.037f0b62-0731-4866-a3d4-7aace09ec61b.1","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","RO5073012","RO5073012","RO5073012, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","RO5073012",NA,"RO5073012",NA,NA,NA,NA,"999","999","999","999","998","total distance (Mean +/- SEM)","037f0b62-0731-4866-a3d4-7aace09ec61b","61e31892-a3f8-4ffc-8fd8-2d93e5d607b9","21","7a6bde79-d73f-4002-971b-31c7b10f0727",NA,"Negative control","Vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"18586","1879.5","C","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,"30","21","998","999","999","999","total distance (Mean +/- SEM)","Locomotor activity","037f0b62-0731-4866-a3d4-7aace09ec61b","ccd7ae95-3d8f-4c18-a6b8-a13053196ea6","21","True",NA,"Sham","2311.5","294.12","S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5073012, 10 mg/kg","TvC","Control - WT vehicle + AMPH",21,18586,1879.5,8612.9510186695,"Rx - WT + AMPH+ RO",21,15368.5,1456.5,6674.52149970318,"Sham - WT vehicle",21,2311.5,294.12,1347.82716340041,TRUE,0.409701956775292,0.0972363773022084,19.7701926326462,52.9229839237427,41.0121447645284,14.6105608340245,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5073012","Oral administration/gavage",10,"Locomotor activity",7.64,"TAAR1 partial agonist","High",249.742,0.023,7.46217305004558,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",8,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST. THIS IDENTIFIES NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR TARGETING PRESYNAPTIC DOPAMINE DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND EFFECTS OF KETAMINE RELEVANT TO ITS THERAPEUTIC USE FOR TREATING MAJOR DEPRESSION. © 2020, THE AUTHOR(S).","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085070146&doi=10.1038%2fs41380-020-0740-6&partnerID=40&md5=cf58dec96623ef2531d396f81359716c","United Kingdom","2021","10.1038/s41380-020-0740-6","ARTICLE","ANIMALS:DOPAMINE:HUMANS:KETAMINE:MICE:PYRANS:RECEPTORS, N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE:SCHIZOPHRENIA:6 FLUORODOPA F 18:DOPAMINE:KETAMINE:PARVALBUMIN:RECEPTOR:SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR:TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1:ULOTARONT:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:DOPAMINE:KETAMINE:N METHYL DEXTRO ASPARTIC ACID RECEPTOR:PYRAN DERIVATIVE:SEP-363856:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL MODEL:ANIMAL TISSUE:ARTICLE:CONTROLLED STUDY:CORPUS STRIATUM:DOPAMINE METABOLISM:DOPAMINERGIC NERVE CELL:DRUG EFFECT:HIPPOCAMPUS:IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:IN VIVO STUDY:INFANT:INTERNEURON:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MESENCEPHALON:MOUSE:NERVE CELL EXCITABILITY:NEUROIMAGING:NONHUMAN:OPEN FIELD TEST:PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY:PRELIMBIC CORTEX:PROTEIN EXPRESSION:RNA SEQUENCING:SCHIZOPHRENIA:VENTRAL SUBICULUM:ANIMAL:HUMAN:SCHIZOPHRENIA",NA,"2-S2.0-85085070146","2023-08-31 13:56:51","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","87890e5c-5da6-4669-9742-891aa2e43a82","Fiona Ramage","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological",NA,"ketamine","30","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"3",NA,"mg/kg",NA,"At disease model induction",NA,1,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,"Single dose",NA,"5",NA,"Days",NA,NA,NA,"Neurobiological outcome (mechanistic) e.g. dopaminergic/seritonergic/glutamatergic signalling","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","Minutes","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6 (mouse)","Exact number","999",NA,NA,"8","10","Weeks","Weight not reported",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No","2023-11-06 17:52:26","d44280e6-1b44-4a36-a314-f73c266d4da3","Fig 5 striatal dopamine synthesis capacity","Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity","5b5def8d-0166-4c7a-bfc0-f86a40271bc6","454a79ba-b34c-4986-814b-6a8bba999270","9","127b0a6f-e9b8-4d76-a424-bc8beeccbc8d","FALSE","Ketamine","ea3c04ea-78c4-4197-bd2b-63acf6486315",NA,"Simple intervention","SEP-0363856",NA,"Intervention",NA,"TRUE","1","0.0155","Mean","Ki mod/min","0.0014","SEM","eba6e60f-d0dd-4462-a0ec-b79eac2193bd.d44280e6-1b44-4a36-a314-f73c266d4da3.5b5def8d-0166-4c7a-bfc0-f86a40271bc6.1","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","SEP-363856","SEP-363856","SEP-363856, 3 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","SEP-363856",NA,"SEP-363856",NA,NA,NA,NA,"999",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity","5b5def8d-0166-4c7a-bfc0-f86a40271bc6","632cab52-ae3d-42a3-8cf8-193153b0cfc2","8","46e41284-b182-4862-996b-11b3c4ea9d24",NA,"Negative control","Vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"0.025","0.004","C","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,"50","999",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Striatal dopamine synthesis capacity","Neurobiological outcome (mechanistic) e.g. dopaminergic/seritonergic/glutamatergic signalling","5b5def8d-0166-4c7a-bfc0-f86a40271bc6","a24989d9-84e4-4400-b0f8-266fa4a8bdff","999","True",NA,"Sham","0.017","1","S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP-363856, 3 mg/kg","TvC","Ketamine + vehicle",8,0.025,0.004,0.0113137084989848,"Ketamine + SEP",9,0.0155,0.0014,0.0042,"Control + vehicle",999,0.017,1,31.6069612585582,TRUE,1.08423747690369,0.270686726002949,118.75,141.42135623731,52.5,52.9740502510427,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6 (mouse)","Male","SEP-363856","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",3,"Neurobiological outcome",6.85,"TAAR1 full agonist","Low (5HT1A partial agonism)",183.27,0.14,4.76151994869329,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",13,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

THE MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (DAT) IS THE RAPID UPTAKE OF RELEASED DA INTO PRESYNAPTIC NERVE TERMINALS LEADING TO CONTROL OF BOTH THE EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DA AND THE INTRACELLULAR STORES OF DA. HERE, WE PRESENT A NEWLY DEVELOPED STRAIN OF RATS IN WHICH THE GENE ENCODINGDATKNOCKOUT RATS (DAT-KO) HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY USING ZINC FINGER NUCLEASE TECHNOLOGY. MALE AND FEMALE DAT-KO RATS DEVELOP NORMALLY BUT WEIGH LESS THAN HETEROZYGOTE AND WILD-TYPE RATS AND DEMONSTRATE PRONOUNCED SPONTANEOUS LOCOMOTOR HYPERACTIVITY. WHILE STRIATAL EXTRACELLULAR DA LIFETIME AND CONCENTRATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, THE TOTAL TISSUE CONTENT OF DA IS MARKEDLY DECREASED DEMONSTRATING THE KEY ROLE OF DAT IN THE CONTROL OF DA NEUROTRANSMISSION. HYPERACTIVITY OF DAT-KO RATS CAN BE COUNTERACTED BY AMPHETAMINE, METHYLPHENIDATE, THE PARTIAL TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AGONIST RO5203648 ((S)-4-(3,4-DICHLORO-PHENYL)-4,5-DIHYDRO-OXAZOL-2-YLAMINE) AND HALOPERIDOL. DAT-KO RATS ALSO DEMONSTRATE A DEFICIT IN WORKING MEMORY AND SENSORIMOTOR GATING TESTS, LESS PROPENSITY TO DEVELOP OBSESSIVE BEHAVIORS AND SHOW STRONG DYSREGULATION IN FRONTOSTRIATAL BDNF FUNCTION.

IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

CURRENT TREATMENTS MANAGE THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, YET HAVE MINIMAL EFFECTS ON THE NEGATIVE AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, TWO PROMINENT FEATURES OF THE DISEASE WITH CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM MORBIDITY. IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, RO5166017 DID NOT CHANGE THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF NORADRENERGIC NEURONS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS, AN AREA DEVOID OF TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, MODULATION OF TAAR1 ACTIVITY ALTERED THE DESENSITIZATION RATE AND AGONIST POTENCY AT 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE DORSAL RAPHE, SUGGESTING THAT TAAR1 MODULATES NOT ONLY DOPAMINERGIC BUT ALSO SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION. IN WT BUT NOT TAAR1-/- MICE, RO5166017 PREVENTED STRESS-INDUCED HYPERTHERMIA AND BLOCKED DOPAMINE-DEPENDENT HYPERLOCOMOTION IN COCAINE-TREATED AND DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER KNOCKOUT MICE AS WELL AS HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN NMDA ANTAGONIST.
