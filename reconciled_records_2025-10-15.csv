Recently, several selective taar 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities. However, it is unknown of the role of these ligands in modulating psychostimulant-induced neurobehavioral plasticity. This study examined the effects of a selective taar 1 agonist, ro5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15. Mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. Ro5263397 (1-10. Mg/kg, i.p.) Alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with ro5263397 (3.2 and 10. Mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity:  however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily ro5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32. Mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction. © 2014 elsevier ireland ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896090771&doi=10.1016%2fj.neulet.2014.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c9922f636007dfd20ecb3e17ae1baf90","Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, School Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences, University At Buffalo, The State University Of New York, Buffalo, Ny 14214, United States:  Department Of Neurology, University Hospital Of Hubei University For Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei 445000, China:  Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, Nc 27709, United States","2014","10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.024","article","animals:central nervous system stimulants:cocaine:cocaine-related disorders:dose-response relationship, drug:male:motor activity:rats, sprague-dawley:receptors, g-protein-coupled:behavioral sensitization:cocaine:rats:taar 1:amine:drugs used in the treatment of addiction:ro 5263397:trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist:unclassified drug:acute drug administration:animal experiment:animal model:article:chronic drug administration:cocaine dependence:controlled study:dose response:hyperactivity:locomotion:male:nerve cell plasticity:nonhuman:priority journal:rat:research:rodent model:sensitization",NA,NA,2024-02-16 11:26:36,"3201c55a-8aa2-4990-96da-99ea8dab451a","150224_SOLES_update",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,"cocaine","15","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"3.2","miligrams (mg) per kg","Prior to disease model induction","7","Days",NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","Single dose","-0.33","Hours",NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",20,"Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Rat","Sprague-dawley (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)",7,999,999,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Grams (g)","No",2025-10-15 09:09:16,"1cd24dc3-3d6a-442a-8948-862836be1cbe","Fig2","Loc60","06fee2ca-c3d8-4d24-b307-41eae1bad95a","5357075a-9182-4e36-b756-454e3cb29eec","RO 3.2 Coc 15  60",7,"False","0eab0af9-4767-4ac3-954b-aefdc51073ac","cocaine 15","False","8d78fa23-81cd-4f21-ad65-1b85f4adbb5c","RO5263397 3.2",TRUE,1,241,"Mean","locomotion counts in 60 min",33.5,"SD"

Antipsychotic medications are the primary therapy approach for this illness, but it's important to pay attention to the adverse effects as well. Clinical studies for SZ are currently in phase ΙΙΙ for SEP-363856 (SEP-856)-a new antipsychotic that doesn't work on dopamine D 2  receptors. However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists);Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",20,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","PPI - 93","02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff","1405b8eb-b5f1-4a24-9127-f6368015c53e","model - control",15,"False","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","dual hit","True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",FALSE,1,0.52,"Mean","%",0.04,"SEM"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists);Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",18,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","social interaction","efb96e4c-d135-4e4a-acf8-f14cab92f8c2","1405b8eb-b5f1-4a24-9127-f6368015c53e","model - control",15,"False","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","dual hit","True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",FALSE,1,16.02,"Mean","s",3.67,"SEM"

First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",14,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","OFT - average speed","4f59a19d-b726-4643-857a-40b7e3cc0808","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","sham - control",15,NA,NA,NA,"True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",TRUE,1,17.8,"Mean","cm/s",1,"SEM"

The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",24,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","MWM - escape latency","dee11d6e-2c78-4d19-bc4e-79a34c95a842","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","sham - control",15,NA,NA,NA,"True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",TRUE,1,123.7,"Mean","s",8.5,"SEM"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists);Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,"1","miligrams (mg) per kg","After disease model induction","12","Days",NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","Multiple doses (enter details in comments)","36","Days",NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",14,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","OFT - average speed","4f59a19d-b726-4643-857a-40b7e3cc0808","cdce1fd1-16b9-409e-b320-eb13cd02c0bf","model - 1",15,"False","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","dual hit","False","9185be4b-692c-40f2-9617-e68e52409e2d","SEP‐363856 1",TRUE,1,20.2,"Mean","cm/s",1.5,"SEM"

Here, we tested in rats the ability of ro5203648, a selective taar1 partial agonist, to modulate the physiological and behavioral effects of methamphetamine (meth). In experiment 1, ro5203468 dose- and time-dependently altered meth-induced locomotor activity, manifested as an early attenuation followed by a late potentiation of meth's stimulating effects. In experiment 2, rats received a 14-day treatment regimen during which ro5203648 was co-administered with meth. Ro5203648 dose-dependently attenuated meth-stimulated hyperactivity, with the effects becoming more apparent as the treatments progressed. After chronic exposure and 3-day withdrawal, rats were tested for locomotor sensitization. Ro5203648 administration during the sensitizing phase prevented the development of meth sensitization. However, ro5203648, at the high dose, cross-sensitized with meth. In experiment 3, ro5203648 dose-dependently blocked meth self-administration without affecting operant responding maintained by sucrose, and exhibited lack of reinforcing efficacy when tested as a meth's substitute. Neurochemical data showed that ro5203648 did not affect meth-mediated da efflux and uptake inhibition in striatal synaptosomes. In vivo, however, ro5203648 was able to transiently inhibit meth-induced accumulation of extracellular da levels in the nucleus accumbens.

In experiment 1, ro5203468 dose- and time-dependently altered meth-induced locomotor activity, manifested as an early attenuation followed by a late potentiation of meth's stimulating effects.

Antipsychotic drugs are thought to re-balance this output by blocking D2 receptors (D2Rs). In this study, we found that amphetamine-driven dopamine release unbalanced D1-SPN and D2-SPN Ca(2+) activity in mice, but that antipsychotic efficacy was associated with the reversal of abnormal D1-SPN, rather than D2-SPN, dynamics, even for drugs that are D2R selective or lacking any dopamine receptor affinity. By contrast, a clinically ineffective drug normalized D2-SPN dynamics but exacerbated D1-SPN dynamics under hyperdopaminergic conditions.

In recent years, several lines of evidence indicated the role of TAAR1 in the regulation of dopaminergic system and its importance in physiological processes such as locomotion, control of emotional states and cognition. In our study, we used RO5263397, a selective TAAR1 agonist, as a tool and characterized its pharmacology in vitro in HEK293 cells and its effects in vivo in tests assessing potential antidepressant and antipsychotic actions. We found that RO5263397 not only increases cAMP levels at very low concentrations but also can induce the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Like other TAAR1 agonists, RO5263397 potently suppressed high dopamine-dependent hyperactivity in mice lacking the dopamine transporter. Moreover, RO5263397 produced a strong antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test comparable to fluoxetine. Furthermore, the antidepressant-like activity was blocked by pretreatment with SCH23390 (dopamine D1 receptor antagonist) or NBQX (glutamate AMPA receptor antagonist) but only in part by WAY100635 (serotonin 5HT1A receptor antagonist).

Due to a non-negligible structural similarity with endogenous ligands, most of the agonists developed so far resulted in being affected by a low selectivity for TAAR1 with respect to other monoaminergic G protein-coupled receptors, like the adrenoreceptors. This study utilized comparative molecular docking studies and quantitative–structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to unveil key structural differences between TAAR1 and alpha2-adrenoreceptor (α2-ADR), with the aim to design novel TAAR1 agonists characterized by a higher selectivity profile and reduced off-target effects. While the presence of hydrophobic motives is encouraged towards both the two receptors, the introduction of polar/positively charged groups and the ligand conformation deeply affect the TAAR1 or α2-ADR putative selectivity. These computational methods allowed the identification of the α2A-ADR agonist guanfacine as an attractive TAAR1-targeting lead compound, demonstrating nanomolar activity in vitro. In vivo exploration of the efficacy of guanfacine showed that it is able to decrease the locomotor activity of dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS.
