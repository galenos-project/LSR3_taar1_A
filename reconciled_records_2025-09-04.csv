Recently, several selective taar 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities. However, it is unknown of the role of these ligands in modulating psychostimulant-induced neurobehavioral plasticity. This study examined the effects of a selective taar 1 agonist, ro5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15. Mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. Ro5263397 (1-10. Mg/kg, i.p.) Alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with ro5263397 (3.2 and 10. Mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity:  however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily ro5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32. Mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction.

However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î²), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3Î², p-GSK-3Î² in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists);Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",20,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","PPI - 93","02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff","1405b8eb-b5f1-4a24-9127-f6368015c53e","model - control",15,"False","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","dual hit","True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",FALSE,1,0.52,"Mean","%",0.04,"SEM"

Clinical studies for SZ are currently in phase ÎÎÎ for SEP-363856 (SEP-856)-a new antipsychotic that doesn't work on dopamine D 2  receptors. However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î²), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3Î², p-GSK-3Î² in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists);Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",18,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","social interaction","efb96e4c-d135-4e4a-acf8-f14cab92f8c2","1405b8eb-b5f1-4a24-9127-f6368015c53e","model - control",15,"False","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","dual hit","True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",FALSE,1,16.02,"Mean","s",3.67,"SEM"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î²), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3Î², p-GSK-3Î² in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",14,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","OFT - average speed","4f59a19d-b726-4643-857a-40b7e3cc0808","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","sham - control",15,NA,NA,NA,"True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",TRUE,1,17.8,"Mean","cm/s",1,"SEM"

First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1Î²), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3Î², p-GSK-3Î² in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3Î² signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781",2024-11-12 10:23:43,"62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",24,"Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",TRUE,"Male","WT","Mouse","Other","Exact number",999,56,0,999,999,"Days","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Other (enter in comments)","Yes",2025-08-19 10:18:06,"128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","MWM - escape latency","dee11d6e-2c78-4d19-bc4e-79a34c95a842","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","sham - control",15,NA,NA,NA,"True","983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03","vehicle",TRUE,1,123.7,"Mean","s",8.5,"SEM"

GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING ANTIPSYCHOTICS, THERE IS URGENT NEED FOR NOVEL DRUGS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES. LASTLY, SEP-856 ACUTE ADMINISTRATION CORRECTED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS PRODUCED BY SUBCHRONIC PCP ADMINISTRATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHTS ON SEP-856, SUGGESTING THAT MODULATION OF THE PFC MAY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR THE FUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVITY OF THIS NOVEL COMPOUND.

Here, we tested in rats the ability of ro5203648, a selective taar1 partial agonist, to modulate the physiological and behavioral effects of methamphetamine (meth). In experiment 1, ro5203468 dose- and time-dependently altered meth-induced locomotor activity, manifested as an early attenuation followed by a late potentiation of meth's stimulating effects. In experiment 2, rats received a 14-day treatment regimen during which ro5203648 was co-administered with meth. Ro5203648 dose-dependently attenuated meth-stimulated hyperactivity, with the effects becoming more apparent as the treatments progressed. After chronic exposure and 3-day withdrawal, rats were tested for locomotor sensitization. Ro5203648 administration during the sensitizing phase prevented the development of meth sensitization. However, ro5203648, at the high dose, cross-sensitized with meth. In experiment 3, ro5203648 dose-dependently blocked meth self-administration without affecting operant responding maintained by sucrose, and exhibited lack of reinforcing efficacy when tested as a meth's substitute. Neurochemical data showed that ro5203648 did not affect meth-mediated da efflux and uptake inhibition in striatal synaptosomes. In vivo, however, ro5203648 was able to transiently inhibit meth-induced accumulation of extracellular da levels in the nucleus accumbens. Taken together, these data highlight the significant potential of taar1 to modulate meth's neurochemical and behavioral effects.

Due to a non-negligible structural similarity with endogenous ligands, most of the agonists developed so far resulted in being affected by a low selectivity for TAAR1 with respect to other monoaminergic G protein-coupled receptors, like the adrenoreceptors. This study utilized comparative molecular docking studies and quantitativeâstructure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to unveil key structural differences between TAAR1 and alpha2-adrenoreceptor (Î±2-ADR), with the aim to design novel TAAR1 agonists characterized by a higher selectivity profile and reduced off-target effects. While the presence of hydrophobic motives is encouraged towards both the two receptors, the introduction of polar/positively charged groups and the ligand conformation deeply affect the TAAR1 or Î±2-ADR putative selectivity. These computational methods allowed the identification of the Î±2A-ADR agonist guanfacine as an attractive TAAR1-targeting lead compound, demonstrating nanomolar activity in vitro. In vivo exploration of the efficacy of guanfacine showed that it is able to decrease the locomotor activity of dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats. Therefore, guanfacine can be considered as an interesting template molecule worthy of structural optimization.

INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-Ã-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, RO5166017 DID NOT CHANGE THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF NORADRENERGIC NEURONS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS, AN AREA DEVOID OF TAAR1 EXPRESSION.
