Recently, several selective taar 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities.

This study examined the effects of a selective taar 1 agonist, ro5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15. Mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. Ro5263397 (1-10. Mg/kg, i.p.) Alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with ro5263397 (3.2 and 10.

More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32. Mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction. © 2014 elsevier ireland ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896090771&doi=10.1016%2fj.neulet.2014.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c9922f636007dfd20ecb3e17ae1baf90","Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, School Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences, University At Buffalo, The State University Of New York, Buffalo, Ny 14214, United States:  Department Of Neurology, University Hospital Of Hubei University For Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei 445000, China:  Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, Nc 27709, United States","2014","10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.024","article","animals:central nervous system stimulants:cocaine:cocaine-related disorders:dose-response relationship, drug:male:motor activity:rats, sprague-dawley:receptors, g-protein-coupled:behavioral sensitization:cocaine:rats:taar 1:amine:drugs used in the treatment of addiction:ro 5263397:trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist:unclassified drug:acute drug administration:animal experiment:animal model:article:chronic drug administration:cocaine dependence:controlled study:dose response:hyperactivity:locomotion:male:nerve cell plasticity:nonhuman:priority journal:rat:research:rodent model:sensitization",NA,NA,"2024-02-16 11:26:36","3201c55a-8aa2-4990-96da-99ea8dab451a","150224_SOLES_update","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Rat","Sprague-dawley (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","8","999","999","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","Yes","2025-03-07 09:48:11","e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689","Fig3","Loc15","Locomotor activity","668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d","4b3fea00-9de9-4118-9236-7c22d19a0569","8","e65603be-23e7-4da2-8904-dbc5ef203c1c","TRUE","vehicle","True",NA,"186bb3ee-a780-4768-ba99-b8bd030cc5c5",NA,"Sham","vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"TRUE","1","35.1","Mean","locomotion counts in 15 min","6.4","SD","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068.e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689.668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d.1",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5263397, 10 mg/kg","TvC","Con Coc 32 15",8,154.3,19.6,19.6,"RO Coc 10 15",8,22.7,8,8,"Con Con 15",8,35.1,6.4,6.4,TRUE,8.31033175988184,2.40817543622815,110.402684563758,16.4429530201342,6.71140939597315,6.27906959770612,1,"Less than 1 week","Prophylactic",7.77,"TAAR1 partial agonist","High",194.21,0.017,8.01594225906474,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",9,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction. © 2014 elsevier ireland ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896090771&doi=10.1016%2fj.neulet.2014.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c9922f636007dfd20ecb3e17ae1baf90","Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, School Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences, University At Buffalo, The State University Of New York, Buffalo, Ny 14214, United States:  Department Of Neurology, University Hospital Of Hubei University For Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei 445000, China:  Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, Nc 27709, United States","2014","10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.024","article","animals:central nervous system stimulants:cocaine:cocaine-related disorders:dose-response relationship, drug:male:motor activity:rats, sprague-dawley:receptors, g-protein-coupled:behavioral sensitization:cocaine:rats:taar 1:amine:drugs used in the treatment of addiction:ro 5263397:trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist:unclassified drug:acute drug administration:animal experiment:animal model:article:chronic drug administration:cocaine dependence:controlled study:dose response:hyperactivity:locomotion:male:nerve cell plasticity:nonhuman:priority journal:rat:research:rodent model:sensitization",NA,NA,"2024-02-16 11:26:36","3201c55a-8aa2-4990-96da-99ea8dab451a","150224_SOLES_update","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Rat","Sprague-dawley (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","8","999","999","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","Yes","2025-03-07 09:48:11","e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689","Fig3","Loc15","Locomotor activity","668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d","4b3fea00-9de9-4118-9236-7c22d19a0569","8","e65603be-23e7-4da2-8904-dbc5ef203c1c","TRUE","vehicle","True",NA,"186bb3ee-a780-4768-ba99-b8bd030cc5c5",NA,"Sham","vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"TRUE","7","34.3","Mean","locomotion counts in 15 min","6","SD","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068.e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689.668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d.7",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5263397, 10 mg/kg","TvC","Con Coc 10 15",8,145.9,20.4,20.4,"RO Coc 32 15",8,73.1,8,8,"Con Con 15",8,34.3,6,6,TRUE,4.44137464058385,0.866431521813165,65.2329749103943,18.2795698924731,7.16845878136201,6.94198707822457,1,"Less than 1 week","Prophylactic",7.77,"TAAR1 partial agonist","High",194.21,0.017,8.01594225906474,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",9,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

BECAUSE TRACE AMINES ALSO INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER TARGETS, SELECTIVE LIGANDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ELUCIDATION OF TAAR1 FUNCTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA UNCOVER IMPORTANT NEUROMODULATORY ROLES FOR TAAR1 AND SUGGEST THAT AGONISTS AT THIS RECEPTOR MIGHT HAVE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL IN ONE OR MORE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DOMAINS. © 2012 SOCIETY OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868195010&doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsych.2012.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=32c3be9e1d3171ae78173e443120bf08",NA,"2012","10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.014","ARTICLE","ACTION POTENTIALS:ANIMALS:DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS:MICE:MOTOR ACTIVITY:OXAZOLES:RAPHE NUCLEI:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:SEROTONERGIC NEURONS:VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA:4 (3,4 DICHLOROPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:ANXIOLYTIC AGENT:G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:RO 5203648:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ALERTNESS:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL MODEL:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:ANXIETY DISORDER:ARTICLE:ATTENTION:BRAIN SLICE:CATALEPSY:CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE:COCAINE DEPENDENCE:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DEPRESSION:DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY:DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS:DRUG ACTIVITY:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG MEGADOSE:DRUG POTENCY:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HAPLORHINI:MONOAMINE NERVE CELL:MOUSE:NONHUMAN:PHYSICOCHEMICAL MODEL:PRIORITY JOURNAL:PROTEIN EXPRESSION:RAT:SEROTONINERGIC NERVE CELL:TRANQUILIZING ACTIVITY:VENTRAL TEGMENTUM:WAKEFULNESS",NA,"2-S2.0-84868195010","2023-08-31 13:56:51","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","dc46ca91-f68a-4a61-b4f4-e26c16a2d1a1","Olena Maksym","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","0","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","wt","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Weight not reported",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yes","2023-11-03 12:48:46","71a6529b-3568-414f-888f-3804b030e4a7","amph mouse","horizontal activity","Locomotor activity","d0770d3c-4eb5-4872-8a1f-a86ef57f71f3","2197e1c3-1e08-4f70-b777-2b3c2df47904","7",NA,"TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sham",NA,NA,NA,NA,"TRUE","0","3210","Mean","counts","520","SEM","4e1d4808-cecc-4b5f-8ffb-1da3389100da.71a6529b-3568-414f-888f-3804b030e4a7.d0770d3c-4eb5-4872-8a1f-a86ef57f71f3.0",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5203648, 1 mg/kg","TvC","mouse vehicle  amphetamine",7,9356.4,1525.6,4036.35820016014,"mouse 1 amphetamine",7,8790.3,1638.7,4335.59267344155,"mouse control",7,3210,520,1375.79068175359,TRUE,0.126493467935669,0.286285735622514,9.21026942600547,65.6702817935725,70.5387328101254,36.4266361281833,0.142857142857143,"Less than 1 week","Prophylactic",7.52,"TAAR1 partial agonist","High",231.08,0.03,4.97154920538905,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",13,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

Antipsychotic medications are the primary therapy approach for this illness, but it's important to pay attention to the adverse effects as well. Clinical studies for SZ are currently in phase ΙΙΙ for SEP-363856 (SEP-856)-a new antipsychotic that doesn't work on dopamine D 2  receptors. However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781","2024-11-12 10:23:43","62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Male","WT","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Exact number","999","56","0","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Other (enter in comments)","Yes","2025-03-07 13:49:09","128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","PPI - 93","Prepulse inhibition","02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","15",NA,"TRUE",NA,"True",NA,"983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03",NA,"Sham","vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"FALSE","1","0.86","Mean","%","0.02","SEM","5ec13944-5c99-413f-9070-795ea2a21e98.128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7.02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff.1",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP-363856, 10 mg/kg","TvC","model - control",15,0.52,0.04,0.154919333848297,"model - 10",15,0.78,0.04,0.154919333848297,"sham - control",15,0.86,0.02,0.0774596669241483,TRUE,1.63286494739438,0.177770798940487,76.4705882352941,-45.5645099553814,-45.5645099553814,16.6378066161541,2,"Between 1-4 weeks","Therapeutic",6.85,"TAAR1 full agonist","Low (5HT1A partial agonism)",183.27,0.14,5.96549275301923,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",12,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions.

Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood.

The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory.

Antipsychotic medications are the primary therapy approach for this illness, but it's important to pay attention to the adverse effects as well. Clinical studies for SZ are currently in phase ΙΙΙ for SEP-363856 (SEP-856)-a new antipsychotic that doesn't work on dopamine D 2  receptors. However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781","2024-11-12 10:23:43","62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Male","WT","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Exact number","999","56","0","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Other (enter in comments)","Yes","2025-03-07 13:49:09","128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","PPI - 87","Prepulse inhibition","f87d6f2e-ff17-41ab-a620-5e5fe115dab9","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","15",NA,"TRUE",NA,"True",NA,"983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03",NA,"Sham","vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"FALSE","1","0.89","Mean","%","0.03","SEM","5ec13944-5c99-413f-9070-795ea2a21e98.128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7.f87d6f2e-ff17-41ab-a620-5e5fe115dab9.1",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP-363856, 1 mg/kg","TvC","model - control",15,0.65,0.04,0.154919333848297,"model - 1",15,0.54,0.03,0.116189500386222,"sham - control",15,0.89,0.03,0.116189500386222,TRUE,-0.781582070628195,0.143514508885458,-45.8333333333333,-64.5497224367903,-48.4122918275927,20.8333333333333,1.71428571428571,"Between 1-4 weeks","Therapeutic",6.85,"TAAR1 full agonist","Low (5HT1A partial agonism)",183.27,0.14,3.66290766002518,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",12,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING ANTIPSYCHOTICS, THERE IS URGENT NEED FOR NOVEL DRUGS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES. LASTLY, SEP-856 ACUTE ADMINISTRATION CORRECTED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS PRODUCED BY SUBCHRONIC PCP ADMINISTRATION.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE.

Here, we tested in rats the ability of ro5203648, a selective taar1 partial agonist, to modulate the physiological and behavioral effects of methamphetamine (meth). In experiment 1, ro5203468 dose- and time-dependently altered meth-induced locomotor activity, manifested as an early attenuation followed by a late potentiation of meth's stimulating effects. In experiment 2, rats received a 14-day treatment regimen during which ro5203648 was co-administered with meth. Ro5203648 dose-dependently attenuated meth-stimulated hyperactivity, with the effects becoming more apparent as the treatments progressed. After chronic exposure and 3-day withdrawal, rats were tested for locomotor sensitization. Ro5203648 administration during the sensitizing phase prevented the development of meth sensitization. However, ro5203648, at the high dose, cross-sensitized with meth. In experiment 3, ro5203648 dose-dependently blocked meth self-administration without affecting operant responding maintained by sucrose, and exhibited lack of reinforcing efficacy when tested as a meth's substitute. Neurochemical data showed that ro5203648 did not affect meth-mediated da efflux and uptake inhibition in striatal synaptosomes. In vivo, however, ro5203648 was able to transiently inhibit meth-induced accumulation of extracellular da levels in the nucleus accumbens.

Due to a non-negligible structural similarity with endogenous ligands, most of the agonists developed so far resulted in being affected by a low selectivity for TAAR1 with respect to other monoaminergic G protein-coupled receptors, like the adrenoreceptors. This study utilized comparative molecular docking studies and quantitative–structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to unveil key structural differences between TAAR1 and alpha2-adrenoreceptor (α2-ADR), with the aim to design novel TAAR1 agonists characterized by a higher selectivity profile and reduced off-target effects. While the presence of hydrophobic motives is encouraged towards both the two receptors, the introduction of polar/positively charged groups and the ligand conformation deeply affect the TAAR1 or α2-ADR putative selectivity.

HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY. BASED ON THE PRECLINICAL DATA AND ITS UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, SEP-856 IS A PROMISING NEW AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND REPRESENTS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS EXPECTED TO LACK THE SIDE EFFECTS STEMMING FROM BLOCKADE OF D2 SIGNALING.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE.

THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, RO5166017 DID NOT CHANGE THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF NORADRENERGIC NEURONS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS, AN AREA DEVOID OF TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, MODULATION OF TAAR1 ACTIVITY ALTERED THE DESENSITIZATION RATE AND AGONIST POTENCY AT 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE DORSAL RAPHE, SUGGESTING THAT TAAR1 MODULATES NOT ONLY DOPAMINERGIC BUT ALSO SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION. IN WT BUT NOT TAAR1-/- MICE, RO5166017 PREVENTED STRESS-INDUCED HYPERTHERMIA AND BLOCKED DOPAMINE-DEPENDENT HYPERLOCOMOTION IN COCAINE-TREATED AND DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER KNOCKOUT MICE AS WELL AS HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN NMDA ANTAGONIST.
