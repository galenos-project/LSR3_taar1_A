TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, RO5166017 DID NOT CHANGE THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF NORADRENERGIC NEURONS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS, AN AREA DEVOID OF TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, MODULATION OF TAAR1 ACTIVITY ALTERED THE DESENSITIZATION RATE AND AGONIST POTENCY AT 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE DORSAL RAPHE, SUGGESTING THAT TAAR1 MODULATES NOT ONLY DOPAMINERGIC BUT ALSO SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION.

TAS ARE LIGANDS FOR THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), AN IMPORTANT MODULATOR OF MONOAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION. HERE, WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAAR1 HYPERSIGNALING BY GENERATING A TRANSGENIC MOUSE LINE OVEREXPRESSING TAAR1 SPECIFICALLY IN NEURONS. TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE DID NOT SHOW OVERT BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS, DESPITE AUGMENTED EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND NORADRENALINE IN THE ACCUMBENS NUCLEUS (ACB) AND OF SEROTONIN IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX. IN VITRO, THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH AN ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS FIRING RATE OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, AND LOCUS COERULEUS AS THE RESULT OF ECTOPIC TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE WERE HYPOSENSITIVE TO THE PSYCHOSTIMULANT EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, AS IT PRODUCED ONLY A WEAK LOCOMOTOR ACTIVATION AND FAILED TO ALTER CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE IN THE ACB. ATTENUATING TAAR1 ACTIVITY WITH THE SELECTIVE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5073012 RESTORED THE STIMULATING EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE ON LOCOMOTION. OVERALL, THESE DATA SHOW THAT TAAR1 BRAIN OVEREXPRESSION CAUSES HYPOSENSITIVITY TO AMPHETAMINE AND ALTERATIONS OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION.

BECAUSE TRACE AMINES ALSO INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER TARGETS, SELECTIVE LIGANDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ELUCIDATION OF TAAR1 FUNCTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA UNCOVER IMPORTANT NEUROMODULATORY ROLES FOR TAAR1 AND SUGGEST THAT AGONISTS AT THIS RECEPTOR MIGHT HAVE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL IN ONE OR MORE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DOMAINS. © 2012 SOCIETY OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868195010&doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsych.2012.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=32c3be9e1d3171ae78173e443120bf08,,2012,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.014,ARTICLE,"ACTION POTENTIALS;ANIMALS;DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS;MICE;MOTOR ACTIVITY;OXAZOLES;RAPHE NUCLEI;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;SEROTONERGIC NEURONS;VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA;4 (3,4 DICHLOROPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT;ANXIOLYTIC AGENT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;NEUROLEPTIC AGENT;RO 5203648;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ALERTNESS;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY;ANXIETY DISORDER;ARTICLE;ATTENTION;BRAIN SLICE;CATALEPSY;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE;COCAINE DEPENDENCE;COGNITION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DEPRESSION;DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DRUG ACTIVITY;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MEGADOSE;DRUG POTENCY;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;HAPLORHINI;MONOAMINE NERVE CELL;MOUSE;NONHUMAN;PHYSICOCHEMICAL MODEL;PRIORITY JOURNAL;PROTEIN EXPRESSION;RAT;SEROTONINERGIC NERVE CELL;TRANQUILIZING ACTIVITY;VENTRAL TEGMENTUM;WAKEFULNESS",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84868195010

CURRENT TREATMENTS MANAGE THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, YET HAVE MINIMAL EFFECTS ON THE NEGATIVE AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, TWO PROMINENT FEATURES OF THE DISEASE WITH CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM MORBIDITY. IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. TAAR1 AGONISTS DO NOT INDUCE CATALEPSY OR WEIGHT GAIN; RO5263397 EVEN REDUCED HALOPERIDOL-INDUCED CATALEPSY AND PREVENTED OLANZAPINE FROM INCREASING BODY WEIGHT AND FAT ACCUMULATION. FINALLY, TAAR1 ACTIVATION PROMOTES VIGILANCE IN RATS AND SHOWS PRO-COGNITIVE AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE PROPERTIES IN RODENT AND PRIMATE MODELS. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9,United Kingdom,2013,10.1038/mp.2012.57,ARTICLE,"ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE;ANIMALS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS;ATTENTION;BENZODIAZEPINES;BODY WEIGHT;COCAINE;CONDITIONING, OPERANT;DEPRESSION;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS;ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY;HALLUCINOGENS;HALOPERIDOL;HUMANS;MACACA FASCICULARIS;MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING;MALE;MENTAL RECALL;MICE;MICE, INBRED C57BL;MICE, TRANSGENIC;MICROINJECTIONS;MOTOR ACTIVITY;MUTATION;OOCYTES;OXAZOLES;PHENCYCLIDINE;PHENETHYLAMINES;PROTEIN BINDING;PYRROLIDINONES;RATS;RATS, WISTAR;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY);SCHIZOPHRENIA;SWIMMING;TELEMETRY;TRITIUM;XENOPUS;2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT;BETA GALACTOSIDASE;CYCLIC AMP;HALOPERIDOL;NEUROLEPTIC AGENT;OLANZAPINE;PROTEIN;RO 5256390;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL TISSUE;ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY;AREA UNDER THE CURVE;ARTICLE;BODY WEIGHT;CATALEPSY;COGNITION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRUG BLOOD LEVEL;DRUG BRAIN LEVEL;DRUG CLEARANCE;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG HALF LIFE;DRUG POTENTIATION;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;HUMAN;HUMAN CELL;LOCOMOTION;MALE;MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION;NONHUMAN;NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING;PRIORITY JOURNAL;RAT;SCHIZOPHRENIA;TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION;WEIGHT GAIN",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84876681068

WHILE SELECTIVE AGONISTS FOR TAAR1 HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED, ONLY ONE HIGH AFFINITY TAAR1 ANTAGONIST HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THUS FAR. WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FOUR POTENTIAL LOW POTENCY TAAR1 ANTAGONISTS THROUGH AN IN SILICO SCREEN ON A TAAR1 HOMOLOGY MODEL. ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED ANTAGONISTS (COMPOUND 22) WAS PREDICTED TO HAVE FAVORABLE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DRUG TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. IN VIVO STUDIES WERE THEREFORE CARRIED OUT AND SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 POTENTIATES AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMPOUND 22 INCREASED FIRING OF DOPAMINE NEURONS SIMILAR TO EPPTB, THE ONLY KNOWN TAAR1 ANTAGONIST. IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE EFFECTS OF COMPOUND 22 WERE MEDIATED THROUGH TAAR1, EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON TAAR1-KO MICE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 IS ABLE TO ENHANCE AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY, EVEN IN TAAR1-KO MICE, SUGGESTING THAT THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF THIS COMPOUND ARE NOT MEDIATED BY TAAR1. IN COLLABORATION WITH PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM, WE ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22. PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM (PDSP) RESULTS SUGGESTED SEVERAL POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22 INCLUDING, THE DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE AND SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; AS WELL AS SIGMA 1 AND 2 RECEPTORS.

TAAR1 ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED TO PLAY A MODULATORY ROLE IN THE DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM. IN SPITE OF A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDIES OF TAAR1 EFFECTS, LITTLE IS STILL KNOWN ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY OF TAAR1 LIGANDS, INCLUDING EFFECTS OF REPEATED TAAR1 AGONIST ADMINISTRATION. THE PRESENT STUDY APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST THAT ESTIMATED THE ACTION OF TAAR1 AGONISTS ON SCHEDULE-INDUCED POLYDIPSIA, A TYPE OF ADJUNCTIVE BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL FOR EVALUATING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS (OCD) AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. OUR RESULTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WIDE RANGE OF RO5263397, THE HIGHLY SELECTIVE PARTIAL TAAR1 AGONIST, DOSES (1–10 MG/KG) ATTENUATED THE POLYDIPSIA INDUCED BY TWO DIFFERENT SCHEDULES OF FOOD DELIVERY IN RATS. THE EFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR THE 7 DAYS OF REPEATED TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE HIGHEST TESTED DOSES OF RO5263397 (6 AND 10 MG/KG) DECREASED THE VERTICAL LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY OF THE ANIMALS AND THE VOLUME OF WATER INTAKE OF THIRSTY RATS FOLLOWING THE ACUTE TREATMENT. ALSO, THOUGH, THE REPEATED RO5263397 ADMINISTRATION IS EXHIBITED TO DIMINISH THE VOLUME OF CONSUMED WATER AND WEIGHT OF RATS WITHOUT SIP, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TOLERANCE WAS OBSERVED TO THESE DRUG EFFECTS. IN GENERAL, THE RO5263397 DECREASES SPECIFICALLY THE ADJUNCTIVE DRINKING AND THIS EFFECT IS MAINTAINED WITH REPEATED DRUG ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOLERANCE. THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS AS AN EVIDENCE FOR THE RO5263397 ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE ACTION, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION BECAUSE THE DRUG ALSO INFLUENCED THE DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND ONLY WEAKLY AFFECTED THE OTHER PARAMETERS OF SIP USED TO REVEAL THE POTENTIAL ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE EFFECTS OF DRUGS. © 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055719905&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuropharm.2018.10.034&partnerID=40&md5=00d6c2db2f6fc4e4ea0852ffc0b36e87,Netherlands,2019,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.10.034,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP, DRUG;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;MALE;MOTOR ACTIVITY;NEUROTRANSMITTER AGENTS;OXAZOLES;POLYDIPSIA;RATS, WISTAR;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;TIME FACTORS;4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYLPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 AMINE;DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AFFECTING AGENT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;4-(3-FLUORO-2-METHYLPHENYL)-4,5-DIHYDROOXAZOL-2-YLAMINE;AGENTS INTERACTING WITH TRANSMITTER, HORMONE OR DRUG RECEPTORS;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;OXAZOLE DERIVATIVE;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ANTICOMPULSIVE LIKE EFFECT;ARTICLE;COMPULSION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MECHANISM;DRUG SELECTIVITY;DRUG TOLERANCE;EVENING DOSAGE;FLUID INTAKE;FOOD INTAKE;LOCOMOTION;MALE;MORNING DOSAGE;NONHUMAN;POLYDIPSIA;PRIORITY JOURNAL;RAT;RECEPTOR UPREGULATION;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;TREATMENT DURATION;AGONISTS;ANIMAL;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODEL;DOSE RESPONSE;DRUG EFFECT;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;METABOLISM;MOTOR ACTIVITY;PHYSIOLOGY;POLYDIPSIA;TIME FACTOR;WISTAR RAT",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85055719905

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY. BASED ON THE PRECLINICAL DATA AND ITS UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, SEP-856 IS A PROMISING NEW AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND REPRESENTS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS EXPECTED TO LACK THE SIDE EFFECTS STEMMING FROM BLOCKADE OF D2 SIGNALING.

SENSORY GATING IS A MECHANISM FOR DOSING AND FILTERING THE INCOMING INFORMATION, BY WHICH THE BRAIN REGULATES THE RESPONSES TO SENSORY STIMULI COMING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. SENSORY GATING DEFICIT IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIA ENDOPHENOTYPES. TAAR1 AGONIST AT A 1 MG/KG DOSAGE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SENSORY GATING INDEX (S1-S2) INCREASE. SENSORY GATING INDEX ROSE DUE TO THE N40 AMPLITUDE INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST STIMULUS IN A PAIR, WHEREAS THE AMPLITUDE OF THE SECOND STIMULUS REMAINED UNCHANGED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SENSORY GATING IN MICE MAY BE MODULATED THROUGH TAAR1-DEPENDENT PROCESSES, INDICATING POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF TAAR1 AND TRACE AMINES IN GENERAL TO THE NEUROPHARMACOLOGY OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES. © 2019 LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS AND WILKINS.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST.

SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES. LASTLY, SEP-856 ACUTE ADMINISTRATION CORRECTED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS PRODUCED BY SUBCHRONIC PCP ADMINISTRATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHTS ON SEP-856, SUGGESTING THAT MODULATION OF THE PFC MAY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR THE FUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVITY OF THIS NOVEL COMPOUND. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST; THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE.

NONETHELESS, THESE OBSERVATIONS AWAIT INDEPENDENT CONFIRMATION AND MORE DETAILED CHARACTERIZATION OF THE IN VITRO AND IN VIVO ACTIONS OF SEP-856 AT TAAR1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE. HEREIN, WE EMPLOYED LUMINESCENCE COMPLEMENTATION TECHNOLOGY IN HETEROLOGOUS LIVE CELL SYSTEMS, CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY, VOLTAGE CLAMP ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY, BEHAVIORAL READOUTS AND TAAR1 KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE TO STUDY SEP-856 IN FURTHER DETAIL. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE ABILITY OF SEP-856 TO ACTIVATE TAAR1 AT THE SURFACE PLASMA MEMBRANE, AND SHOW THAT THIS INTERACTION RESULTS IN GΑS RECRUITMENT (PEC50: 6.08 ± 0.22 EMAX: 96.41% ± 15.26) AND BY EXTENSION, TO G-PROTEIN INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM (GIRK) CHANNEL ACTIVATION. USING TAAR1-KO MICE, WE FIND TAAR1 TO BE INDISPENSABLE FOR SEP-856 CONTROL OF BODY TEMPERATURE, BASELINE LOCOMOTION REDUCTION AND FOR “ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE” EFFICACY AS CHARACTERIZED BY A REVERSAL OF DIZOCILIPINE (MK-801) MEDIATED DISRUPTION OF PRE-PULSE INHIBITION.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

3b4e8d12-eed8-4824-975d-0ed644d65e92,Regulation of monoaminergic functions by GPCRS with a special emphasis on mental and movement disorders,Ioannis Mantas,Dissertation Abstracts International,,"Dysfunction of the brain's monoaminergic system has been implicated in many human neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. The monoamines that are most dysregulated in these diseases, are dopamine and serotonin. Monoamines act as signalling molecules through their receptors, which belong predominately to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily1. Most of the clinically employed drugs that are used to tackle these diseases, target directly or indirectly the monoaminergic class of GPCRs. This thesis aims to identify the role of four understudied GPCR-signalling related molecules (GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1) in animal models of PD, MDD and schizophrenia.The main findings relate to the functions of GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1 in relationship to PD, MDD and schizophrenia. GPR88 has been suggested as crucial suppressor of striatal medium spiny neuron activity. We showed that loss of GPR88 facilitates L- dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment for PD by aiding its therapeutic efficacy without worsening its side effects. TAAR1 has been described as negative regulator of dopamine neurons firing rate. Herein, we report that TAAR1 deletion enhances the response of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors but no other classes of antidepressants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the antipsychotic action of the pioneering drug, SEP-856, depends in part on TAAR1 agonism. P11 is a small GPCR-adaptor protein that has been linked to MDD and antidepressant treatment response. In the current thesis, we demonstrate that loss of p11 causes an overt response to stress by triggering the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenomedullary axes. Finally, NURR1 is a GPCR regulated transcription factor, which is linked to PD and schizophrenia as a consequence of its fundamental role in coordinating midbrain dopamine neuron development. In the present work, we describe the role of NURR1 in extra-dopaminergic brain structures such as striatum and claustrum. In detail, we show that induced striatal NURR1 is crucial for locomotor sensitization to L-DOPA. Moreover, we revealed that NURR1 is important factor for claustral neuron transcriptional identity without affecting the occurrence of hallucinogen states' neural correlates.Overall, we explored new avenues in the fields of neurology and psychiatry related molecular neurobiology. These findings may support future drug discovery research on PD, MDD and schizophrenia though the identification of novel pharmaceutical agents to treat these detrimental disorders. Thus, this body of work contributes to the better understanding of both the pharmacology and pathophysiology of mental and movement disorders.

Millan and Per Svenningsson (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2022[Dec], Vol 47[13], 2319-2329). The technical name of the compound studied in this article was incorrectly referred to as SEP-383856 in the title and the abstract and has now been corrected to SEP-363856. None of the scientific conclusions in this paper are affected by this correction. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-02373-001). SEP-383856 (SEP-856) is a novel antipsychotic under clinical development. It displays a unique pattern of receptor interaction, with only weak (partial agonist) activity at dopamine D2 receptors, yet more potent agonist activity at the trace amine associated receptor (TAAR1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor (5-HT1A). Nonetheless, these observations await independent confirmation and more detailed characterization of the in vitro and in vivo actions of SEP-856 at TAAR1 and 5-HT1A receptors would be instructive. Herein, we employed luminescence complementation technology in heterologous live cell systems, confocal microscopy, voltage clamp electrophysiology, behavioral readouts and TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice to study SEP-856 in further detail. We provide evidence for the ability of SEP-856 to activate TAAR1 at the surface plasma membrane, and show that this interaction results in Galphas recruitment (pEC50: 6.08 +/- 0.22 EMAX: 96.41% +/- 15.26) and by extension, to G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel activation. Using TAAR1-KO mice, we find TAAR1 to be indispensable for SEP-856 control of body temperature, baseline locomotion reduction and for ""antipsychotic-like"" efficacy as characterized by a reversal of dizocilipine (MK-801) mediated disruption of pre-pulse inhibition. Conversely, the inhibition by SEP-856 of MK-801 induced locomotion was unaffected in TAAR1 KO mice. SEP-856 behaved as a low-potency, partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, while it partially inhibited recruitment of D2 receptor-coupled Galpha and GIRK by DA and acted as a weak partial agonist with low potency at the same receptor when applied alone. Our findings corroborate and extend previous observations on the molecular substrates engaged by this unique, dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist and potential antipsychotic that could prove to have major advantages in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Such diseases typically feature poor decision making and lack of control on executive functions and have been studied through the years using many animal models. Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) mice, in particular, have been widely used to study ADHD. Recently, a strain of DAT KO rats has been developed (1). Here, we provide a phenotypic characterization of reward sensitivity and compulsive choice by adult rats born from DAT-HET dams bred with DAT-HET males, in order to further validate DAT KO rats as an animal model for preclinical research. We first tested DAT KO rats' sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, provided by highly appetitive food or sweet water; then, we tested their choice behavior with an Intolerance-to-Delay Task (IDT). During these tests, DAT KO rats appeared less sensitive to rewarding stimuli than wild-type (WT) and HET rats: they also showed a prominent hyperactive behavior with a rigid choice pattern and a wide number of compulsive stereotypies. Moreover, during the IDT, we tested the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and RO-5203648, a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial agonist. AMPH accentuated impulsive-behaviors in WT and HET rats, while it had no effect in DAT KO rats. Finally, we measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine receptor 2 (D2), serotonin transporter, and TAAR1 mRNA transcripts in samples of ventral striatum, finding no significant differences between WT and KO genotypes. Throughout this study, DAT KO rats showed alterations in decision-making processes and in motivational states, as well as prominent motor and oral stereotypies: more studies are warranted to fully characterize and efficiently use them in preclinical research.",,,2018,10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00043,article,Intolerance-to-Delay Task;sucrose consumption;appetitive food eating;reward sensitivity;behavioral rigidity,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000425762500001
