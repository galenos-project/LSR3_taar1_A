8a14a714-b9ae-4f67-8230-cf30aa4f30e8,Some aspects of basic psychopharmacology: The trace amines,Alan A Boulton,Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,"Discusses recent research on the behavioral effects of phenylethylamine (PEA) and recent data implicating the trace amines in schizophrenia, agoraphobia, and aggression. In mice, PEA produces a distinctive hyperactivity syndrome consisting of 2 phases; it appears to act via dopamine and 5-HT on different components of these stereotypies. Urinary unconjugated tryptamine, and meta- and paratyramine appear to be excreted in reduced amounts in schizophrenia and bipolar depression. The blood levels of the trace acids phenylacetic and meta- and parahydroxyphenylacetic are reduced in schizophrenia. Blood levels of conjugated phenylacetic and unconjugated parahydroxyphenylacetic acid are reduced in violent as opposed to nonviolent offenders. The neuromodulatory role of the trace amines and their possible involvement in components of behavior and certain mental disorders are discussed.

(ST. JOHN'S WORT; SJW) IS ONE OF THE LEADING PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC PHYTOMEDICINES AND GREAT EFFORT HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO CLARIFYING ITS MECHANISM OF ACTION. OBJECTIVE: WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF SEVERAL PURE COMPOUNDS ISOLATED FROM THE CRUDE EXTRACT TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE MOLECULAR ACTIONS OF VARIOUS SUBSTITUENTS OF SJW. METHODS: WE CHARACTERIZED THE IN VITRO PHARMACOLOGY OF THE NAPHTHODIANTHRONES HYPERICIN AND PSEUDOHYPERICIN, THE PHLOROGLUCINOL DERIVATIVE HYPERFORIN, AND SEVERAL FLAVONOIDS AT 42 BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTORS AND TRANSPORTERS USING THE RESOURCES OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM. RESULTS: THE BIFLAVONOID AMENTOFLAVONE SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED BINDING AT SEROTONIN (5-HT1D, 5-HT2C), D3-DOPAMINE, Α-OPIATE, AND BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTORS. THE NAPHTHODIANTHRONE HYPERICIN HAD SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITY AT D3- AND D4-DOPAMINE RECEPTORS AND Β-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE D1-DOPAMINE RECEPTOR, THE PHLOROGLUCINOL DERIVATIVE HYPERFORIN WAS LESS ACTIVE THAN OTHER SJW CONSTITUENTS TESTED ON ALL SCREENED RECEPTORS. CONCLUSION: OUR PRESENT IN VITRO DATA CLEARLY SHOW THAT SEVERAL PURE SUBSTANCES IN SJW ARE POTENTIAL CNS PSYCHOACTIVE AGENTS AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY OF THE PLANT IN A COMPLEX MANNER. OUR DATA ALSO REVEAL NOVEL AND HERETOFORE UNEXPECTED INTERACTIONS OF PURE COMPOUNDS IN SJW AT A NUMBER OF GPCRS, TRANSPORTERS, AND ION CHANNELS. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ADDITIVE OR SYNERGISTIC ACTIONS OF DIFFERENT SINGLE COMPOUNDS MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY OF SJW.

USING INTRACELLULAR ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS, WE INVESTIGATED THE DEPRESSANT ACTION OF TWO TRACE AMINES (Β-PHENYLETHYLAMINE AND TYRAMINE) ON THE FIRING ACTIVITY OF DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS OF THE SUBSTANTIA NIGRA PARS COMPACTA AND VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA. THIS INHIBITION WAS DUE TO A MEMBRANE HYPERPOLARISATION THAT WAS BLOCKED BY THE D2 DOPAMINE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST SULPIRIDE AND WAS NOT POTENTIATED BY THE DOPAMINE-UPTAKE BLOCKER, COCAINE. INHIBITION OF THE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER DID NOT MEDIATE THE EFFECTS OF TRACE AMINES, BECAUSE UNLIKE COCAINE, TRACE AMINES DID NOT POTENTIATE THE INHIBITORY RESPONSES TO EXOGENOUSLY APPLIED DOPAMINE. THE INHIBITORY ACTIONS OF Β-PHENYLETHYLAMINE AND TYRAMINE WERE PRESENT IN RESERPINE-TREATED ANIMALS BUT WERE ABOLISHED WHEN THE DOPAMINE-SYNTHESIS INHIBITOR CARBIDOPA WAS APPLIED. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT TRACE AMINES CAUSE AN INDIRECT ACTIVATION OF DOPAMINE AUTORECEPTORS, BY AN INCREASED EFFLUX OF NEWLY SYNTHESISED DOPAMINE.

OBJECTIVE: WE SYSTEMATICALLY TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS BY SCREENING A LARGE NUMBER OF PSYCHOACTIVE COMPOUNDS, INCLUDING MANY ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS, FOR AGONIST ACTIVITY AT CLONED, HUMAN M1, M 3 AND M5 MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS. RESULTS: ONLY THREE OF THE 14 ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS WE TESTED WERE FOUND TO POSSESS PARTIAL AGONIST ACTIONS AT M1 MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS (FLUPERLAPINE, JL13, CLOZAPINE). A FEW ADDITIONAL MISCELLANEOUS COMPOUNDS HAD A MODEST DEGREE OF M1 AGONIST ACTIONS. ONLY CARBACHOL AND N-DESMETHYLCLOZAPINE HAD APPRECIABLE M 3 MUSCARINIC AGONISM AT M3 MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS, ALTHOUGH SEVERAL WERE M5 PARTIAL AGONISTS INCLUDING MK-212, N-DESMETHYLCLOZAPINE AND XANOMELINE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH M1 MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR-SELECTIVE PARTIAL AGONISTS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN SOME PRECLINICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG MODELS, THESE STUDIES INDICATE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE SALUTARY ACTIONS OF CLOZAPINE AND SIMILAR ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS ARE MEDIATED SOLELY BY M1 MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR ACTIVATION. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE M1 AGONISM OF N-DESMETHYLCLOZAPINE CONTRIBUTES TO THE UNIQUELY BENEFICIAL ACTIONS OF CLOZAPINE. THUS, THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE NOTION THAT A BALANCED DEGREE OF ACTIVITY AT MULTIPLE BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTORS, INCLUDING M1 MUSCARINIC AGONISM, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UNIQUELY BENEFICIAL ACTIONS OF CLOZAPINE. © SPRINGER-VERLAG 2004.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-16844363204&doi=10.1007%2fs00213-004-2017-1&partnerID=40&md5=afacf4224be7b5557df98c7165df3c02,Germany,2005,10.1007/s00213-004-2017-1,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS;CHO CELLS;CLOZAPINE;CRICETINAE;CRICETULUS;DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP, DRUG;DRUG EVALUATION, PRECLINICAL;PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY;PYRIDINES;RECEPTORS, MUSCARINIC;THIADIAZOLES;2 DIPROPYLAMINO 8 HYDROXYTETRALIN;6 CHLORO 2 (1 PIPERAZINYL)PYRAZINE;AMANTADINE;AMITRIPTYLINE;AMOXAPINE;AMPEROZIDE;ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENT;BACLOFEN;BENZATROPINE;CARBACHOL;CLOZAPINE;CYPROHEPTADINE;DESIPRAMINE;FLUPERLAPINE;FLUPHENAZINE;HALOPERIDOL;ILOPERIDONE;IMIPRAMINE;IPSAPIRONE;JL 13;KETANSERIN;LOXAPINE;MELPERONE;MEPYRAMINE;MUSCARINIC M1 RECEPTOR;MUSCARINIC M3 RECEPTOR;MUSCARINIC M5 RECEPTOR;NORCLOZAPINE;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;UNINDEXED DRUG;XANOMELINE;ANIMAL CELL;ARTICLE;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRUG ACTIVITY;DRUG EFFECT;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MECHANISM;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;FEMALE;MOLECULAR MIMICRY;NONHUMAN;PRIORITY JOURNAL",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-16844363204

MULTIPLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE SUGGESTION OF RETINOIDS AND THYROID HORMONES AS PLAUSIBLE ACTORS IN THESE ROLES. BOTH ARE NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL FOR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM BUT ALSO REGULATE THE EXPRESSION OF MANY NEUROTRANSMITTERS, THEIR SYNTHESIZING ENZYMES AND RECEPTORS, AND OTHER GENES IN BROADER SIGNALING TRANSDUCTION CASCADES AFFECTING PATHWAYS THAT ARE ALTERED IN RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. FUNCTIONAL AND POSITIONAL CANDIDATE GENES INCLUDE RETINOIC ACID AND THYROID HORMONE RECEPTORS, RETINALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASES AND DEIODINASES, WHICH SYNTHESIZE THE POWERFUL MORPHOGENS, RETINOIC ACID AND TRIIODOTHYRONINE, AND THE ENZYMES INVOLVED IN THEIR INACTIVATION.

THEY ARE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED METABOLICALLY WITH THE DOPAMINE, NORADRENALINE AND SEROTONIN NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS IN MAMMALIAN BRAIN. LIKE DOPAMINE, NORADRENALINE AND SEROTONIN THE TRACE AMINES HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN A VAST ARRAY OF HUMAN DISORDERS OF AFFECT AND COGNITION. THE TRACE AMINES ARE UNIQUE AS THEY ARE PRESENT IN TRACE CONCENTRATIONS, EXHIBIT HIGH RATES OF METABOLISM AND ARE DISTRIBUTED HETEROGENEOUSLY IN MAMMALIAN BRAIN. WHILE SOME ARE SYNTHESIZED IN THEIR PARENT AMINE NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS, THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST OTHER TRACE AMINES MAY COMPRISE THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT NEUROTRANSMITTER SYSTEMS. A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE TRACE AMINES MAY PLAY VERY SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN THE COORDINATION OF BIOGENIC AMINE-BASED SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGY. AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS, THEY HAVE WELL-CHARACTERIZED PRESYNAPTIC ""AMPHETAMINE-LIKE"" EFFECTS ON CATECHOLAMINE AND INDOLAMINE RELEASE, REUPTAKE AND BIOSYNTHESIS; AT LOWER CONCENTRATIONS, THEY POSSESS POSTSYNAPTIC MODULATORY EFFECTS THAT POTENTIATE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER NEUROTRANSMITTERS, PARTICULARLY DOPAMINE AND SEROTONIN. THE TRACE AMINES ALSO POSSESS ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS, INDICATING TO SOME RESEARCHERS THE EXISTENCE OF RECEPTORS SPECIFIC FOR THE TRACE AMINES. WHILE BINDING SITES OR RECEPTORS FOR A FEW OF THE TRACE AMINES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED, THE ABSENCE OF CLONED RECEPTOR PROTEIN HAS IMPEDED SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR DETAILED MECHANISTIC ROLES IN THE COORDINATION OF CATECHOLAMINE AND INDOLAMINE SYNAPTIC PHYSIOLOGY.

ALTHOUGH LONG KNOWN TO MODULATE NEUROTRANSMISSION INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE RELEASE OF CATECHOLAMINES, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE TRACE AMINE 1 RECEPTOR (TA1) OFFERS A MECHANISM BY WHICH TRACE AMINES CAN INFLUENCE SYNAPTIC ACTIVITY DIRECTLY. TA1 BINDS AND IS ACTIVATED BY TRACE AMINES SUCH AS Β-PHENYLETHYLAMINE AND TYRAMINE. OUR PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF MOUSE TA1 SHOWED THAT, AS IN RAT AND PRIMATE, AMPHETAMINE IS AN AGONIST AT THIS RECEPTOR BUT WITH SURPRISINGLY HIGH POTENCY. WITHOUT SELECTIVE LIGANDS FOR TA1 THAT DO NOT ALSO POSSESS CATECHOLAMINE-RELEASING PROPERTIES, HOWEVER, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO STUDY ITS PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. TO THAT END, A LINE OF MICE LACKING THE TA1 RECEPTOR WAS GENERATED TO CHARACTERIZE ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE REGULATION OF BEHAVIOR. COMPARED WITH WILD-TYPE LITTERMATES, TA1 KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE DISPLAYED A DEFICIT IN PREPULSE INHIBITION. KNOCKOUT ANIMALS, IN WHICH THE TA1-AGONIST INFLUENCE OF AMPHETAMINE WAS ABSENT, SHOWED ENHANCED SENSITIVITY TO THE PSYCHOMOTOR-STIMULATING EFFECT OF THIS DRUG, WHICH WAS TEMPORALLY CORRELATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER INCREASES IN THE RELEASE OF BOTH DOPAMINE AND NOREPINEPHRINE IN THE DORSAL STRIATUM AND ASSOCIATED WITH A 262% INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF STRIATAL HIGH-AFFINITY D2 RECEPTORS. TA1 THEREFORE APPEARS TO PLAY A MODULATORY ROLE IN CATECHOLAMINERGIC FUNCTION AND REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY NOVEL MECHANISM FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS.

THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF THE TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTORS AND THE ACTIVITY OF DMT AND OTHER HALLUCINOGENIC COMPOUNDS AT THESE RECEPTOR SITES LEADS TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE ENDOGENOUS HALLUCINOGENS ACT AS NEUROTRANSMITTERS OF A SUBCLASS OF THESE TRACE AMINE RECEPTORS. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE ACTIVITY AT THE SEROTONIN 5-HT2A RECEPTOR HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HALLUCINOGENIC AFFECTS OF ADMINISTERED HALLUCINOGENS, IN THEIR NATURAL SETTING THE 5-HT2A RECEPTOR MAY NOT INTERACT WITH THE ENDOGENOUS HALLUCINOGENS AT ALL. ADDITIONALLY 5-HT2A AGONIST ACTIVITY IS UNABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE VISUAL ALTERING EFFECTS OF MANY OF THE ADMINISTERED HALLUCINOGENS; THESE EFFECTS MAY BE MEDIATED BY ONE OF THE ENDOGENOUS HALLUCINOGEN TRACE AMINE RECEPTORS RATHER THAN THE SEROTONIN 5-HT2A RECEPTOR. THEREFORE, ACTIVITY AT THE TRACE AMINE RECEPTORS, IN ADDITION TO SEROTONIN RECEPTORS, MAY PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN THE SENSORY ALTERING EFFECTS OF ADMINISTERED HALLUCINOGENS AND THE TRACE AMINE RECEPTORS ALONG WITH THEIR ENDOGENOUS HALLUCINOGEN LIGANDS MAY SERVE AN ENDOGENOUS ROLE IN MEDIATING SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE MAMMALIAN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.

UNLIKE TAAR1, RHESUS MONKEY TAAR6 DID NOT ALTER CAMP LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO 10 ΜM OF MONOAMINES (DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, SEROTONIN, Β-PHENYLETHYLAMINE (Β-PEA), OCTOPAMINE, TRYPTAMINE, AND TYRAMINE) OR METHAMPHETAMINE IN STABLY TRANSFECTED CELLS IN VITRO. REAL-TIME CELL ELECTRONIC SENSING ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE RECEPTOR DID NOT ALTER CELL IMPEDANCE OR CHANGE THE EFFECT OF FORSKOLIN ON CELL IMPEDANCE AT EXPOSURE TO 20 ΜM OF EACH MONOAMINE, SUGGESTING A LACK OF EITHER GS OR GI-LINKED SIGNALING. WHEREAS Κ OPIOID RECEPTOR ACTIVATION LED TO ERK PHOSPHORYLATION AT EXPOSURE TO 1 ΜM U69593, RHESUS MONKEY TAAR6 HAD NO SUCH EFFECT AT EXPOSURE TO 10 ΜM OF MONOAMINES OR METHAMPHETAMINE. MEMBRANE AND CELL SURFACE LOCALIZATION OF TAAR6 WAS CONFIRMED BY IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY, BIOTINYLATION, AND WESTERN BLOT TESTING WITH A TAAR6 ANTIBODY IN THE TRANSFECTED CELLS. REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE-POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION AMPLIFICATION SHOWED THAT TAAR6 MRNA WAS UNDETECTABLE IN SELECTED RHESUS MONKEY BRAIN REGIONS. TOGETHER, THE DATA REVEAL THAT TAAR6 IS UNRESPONSIVE TO BRAIN MONOAMINES AND IS NOT EXPRESSED IN RHESUS MONKEY BRAIN MONOAMINERGIC NUCLEI, SUGGESTING TAAR6 LACKS DIRECT ASSOCIATION WITH BRAIN MONOAMINERGIC NEURONAL FUNCTION. © 2008 WILEY-LISS, INC.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-57049188185&doi=10.1002%2fjnr.21783&partnerID=40&md5=b5d8458e4804051552f26b90ca7396a9,United Kingdom,2008,10.1002/jnr.21783,ARTICLE,"AMINO ACID SEQUENCE;ANIMALS;BIOGENIC MONOAMINES;BLOTTING, WESTERN;BRAIN;CLONING, MOLECULAR;CYCLIC AMP;DOPAMINE AGENTS;GENE EXPRESSION;GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING;HUMANS;IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY;MACACA MULATTA;METHAMPHETAMINE;MOLECULAR SEQUENCE DATA;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION;SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION;TRANSFECTION;CYCLIC AMP;DOPAMINE;FORSKOLIN;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;INHIBITORY GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE BINDING PROTEIN;KAPPA OPIATE RECEPTOR;MESSENGER RNA;METHAMPHETAMINE;MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE;MONOAMINE;NORADRENALIN;OCTOPAMINE;PHENETHYLAMINE;PROTEIN ANTIBODY;PSYCHOSTIMULANT AGENT;SEROTONIN;STIMULATORY GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE BINDING PROTEIN;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 6;TRYPTAMINE;TYRAMINE;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ANIMAL CELL;ARTICLE;BIOTINYLATION;BRAIN REGION;CELL MEMBRANE;CELL SURFACE;CELLULAR DISTRIBUTION;CONTROLLED STUDY;ENZYME PHOSPHORYLATION;GENETIC TRANSFECTION;HUMAN;HUMAN CELL;IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY;IMPEDANCE;IN VITRO STUDY;MOLECULAR CLONING;MONOAMINERGIC SYSTEM;NONHUMAN;NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE;PRIORITY JOURNAL;PROTEIN ANALYSIS;PROTEIN EXPRESSION;PROTEIN INTERACTION;PROTEIN LOCALIZATION;REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION;RHESUS MONKEY;SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION;WESTERN BLOTTING",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-57049188185

IN HEK (HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY)-293/CRE-BLA CELLS, MOUSE TAAR1 SHOWED A ROBUST RESPONSE TO TRACE AMINES AS MEASURED USING EITHER A CAMP ASSAY OR A Β-LACTAMASE REPORTER ASSAY, WHEREAS HUMAN TAAR1 SHOWED A WEAKER, BUT STILL MEASURABLE, RESPONSE. WHEN CERTAIN FRAGMENTS OF HUMAN TAAR1 WERE REPLACED WITH THE CORRESPONDING REGIONS OF MOUSE TAAR1, THE CHIMAERIC RECEPTOR SHOWED A MUCH STRONGER RESPONSE IN CAMP PRODUCTION. EXAMINATION OF A SERIES OF AGONISTS ON THESE RECEPTORS REVEALED THAT THE HUMAN AND THE CHIMAERIC RECEPTOR ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL IN PHARMACOLOGY, BUT DISTINCT FROM THE MOUSE RECEPTOR. WE ALSO SCREENED SMALL LIBRARIES OF PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE AGENTS ON TAAR1 AND IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF SYNTHETIC AGONISTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE ALSO LIGANDS OF THE ENIGMATIC IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTOR.

THEREFORE, WE SET OUT TO STUDY THE FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL EVOLUTION OF THESE GENES WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON PRIMATES. FUNCTIONAL ANALYSES SHOWED THAT LIGANDS ACTIVATING THE MURINE TAAR3, TAAR4 AND TAAR5 DO NOT ACTIVATE INTACT PRIMATE AND MAMMALIAN ORTHOLOGS, ALTHOUGH THEY EVOLVE UNDER PURIFYING SELECTION AND HENCE MUST BE FUNCTIONAL. WE ALSO FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE SELECTION THAT COULD EXPLAIN THE FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MOUSE AND OTHER MAMMALS. OUR FINDINGS RATHER SUGGEST THAT THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED VOLATILE AMINE TAAR3-5 AGONISTS REFLECT THE HIGH AGONIST PROMISCUITY OF TAAR, AND THAT THE LIGANDS DRIVING PURIFYING SELECTION OF THESE TAAR IN MOUSE AND OTHER MAMMALS STILL AWAIT DISCOVERY.

THE AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO GAIN BETTER KNOWLEDGE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS DRUG AND HALLUCINOGENIC PROCESSES BY STUDYING DMT BEHAVIOR IN COMPARISON WITH TRYPTAMINE. METHODS: 131I-LABELED DMT AND TRYPTAMINE WERE INJECTED INTO RABBITS. Γ-CAMERA AND BIODISTRIBUTION STUDIES WERE PERFORMED. BRAIN UPTAKE, PLASMA CLEARANCE, AND RENAL EXCRETION WERE ASSESSED FOR EACH INDOLEALKYLAMINE. RESULTS: DMT AND TRYPTAMINE SHOWED DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR WHEN BRAIN UPTAKE, RESIDENCE TIME, AND EXCRETION WERE COMPARED. LABELED DMT ENTERED THE BRAIN 10 S AFTER INJECTION, CROSSED THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER, AND BOUND TO RECEPTORS; THEN IT WAS PARTIALLY RENALLY EXCRETED. IT WAS DETECTED IN URINE WITHIN 24 H AFTER INJECTION AND REMAINED IN THE BRAIN, EVEN AFTER URINE EXCRETION CEASED; UP TO 0.1% OF THE INJECTED DOSE WAS DETECTED AT 7 D AFTER INJECTION IN THE OLFACTORY BULB. IN CONTRAST, TRYPTAMINE WAS RAPIDLY TAKEN UP IN THE BRAIN AND FULLY EXCRETED 10 MIN AFTER INJECTION. CONCLUSION: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION THAT EXOGENOUS DMT REMAINS IN THE BRAIN FOR AT LEAST 7 D AFTER INJECTION. ALTHOUGH LABELED DMT AND TRYPTAMINE BEHAVE AS AGONISTS FOR AT LEAST 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE 2A RECEPTOR, 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE 2C RECEPTOR, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR, AND Σ-1 PUTATIVE RECEPTOR TARGETS, BINDING TO THE LATTER CAN EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR OF LABELED DMT AND TRYPTAMINE IN THE BRAIN. THE PERSISTENCE IN THE BRAIN CAN BE FURTHER EXPLAINED ON THE BASIS THAT DMT AND OTHER N,N-DIALKYLTRYPTAMINES ARE TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES FOR BOTH THE PLASMA MEMBRANE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER AND THE VESICLE MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER 2. FURTHERMORE, STORAGE IN VESICLES PREVENTS DMT DEGRADATION BY MONOAMINE OXIDASE. AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS, DMT IS TAKEN UP BY THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER AND FURTHER STORED IN VESICLES BY THE VESICLE MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER 2, TO BE RELEASED UNDER APPROPRIATE STIMULI.

TAS ARE LIGANDS FOR THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), AN IMPORTANT MODULATOR OF MONOAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION. HERE, WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAAR1 HYPERSIGNALING BY GENERATING A TRANSGENIC MOUSE LINE OVEREXPRESSING TAAR1 SPECIFICALLY IN NEURONS. TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE DID NOT SHOW OVERT BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS, DESPITE AUGMENTED EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND NORADRENALINE IN THE ACCUMBENS NUCLEUS (ACB) AND OF SEROTONIN IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX. IN VITRO, THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH AN ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS FIRING RATE OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, AND LOCUS COERULEUS AS THE RESULT OF ECTOPIC TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE WERE HYPOSENSITIVE TO THE PSYCHOSTIMULANT EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, AS IT PRODUCED ONLY A WEAK LOCOMOTOR ACTIVATION AND FAILED TO ALTER CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE IN THE ACB. ATTENUATING TAAR1 ACTIVITY WITH THE SELECTIVE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5073012 RESTORED THE STIMULATING EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE ON LOCOMOTION. OVERALL, THESE DATA SHOW THAT TAAR1 BRAIN OVEREXPRESSION CAUSES HYPOSENSITIVITY TO AMPHETAMINE AND ALTERATIONS OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION.

BECAUSE TRACE AMINES ALSO INFLUENCE THE ACTIVITY OF OTHER TARGETS, SELECTIVE LIGANDS ARE NEEDED FOR THE ELUCIDATION OF TAAR1 FUNCTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA UNCOVER IMPORTANT NEUROMODULATORY ROLES FOR TAAR1 AND SUGGEST THAT AGONISTS AT THIS RECEPTOR MIGHT HAVE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL IN ONE OR MORE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DOMAINS. © 2012 SOCIETY OF BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84868195010&doi=10.1016%2fj.biopsych.2012.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=32c3be9e1d3171ae78173e443120bf08,,2012,10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.05.014,ARTICLE,"ACTION POTENTIALS;ANIMALS;DOPAMINERGIC NEURONS;MICE;MOTOR ACTIVITY;OXAZOLES;RAPHE NUCLEI;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;SEROTONERGIC NEURONS;VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA;4 (3,4 DICHLOROPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT;ANXIOLYTIC AGENT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;NEUROLEPTIC AGENT;RO 5203648;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ALERTNESS;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY;ANXIETY DISORDER;ARTICLE;ATTENTION;BRAIN SLICE;CATALEPSY;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE;COCAINE DEPENDENCE;COGNITION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DEPRESSION;DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DRUG ACTIVITY;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MEGADOSE;DRUG POTENCY;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;HAPLORHINI;MONOAMINE NERVE CELL;MOUSE;NONHUMAN;PHYSICOCHEMICAL MODEL;PRIORITY JOURNAL;PROTEIN EXPRESSION;RAT;SEROTONINERGIC NERVE CELL;TRANQUILIZING ACTIVITY;VENTRAL TEGMENTUM;WAKEFULNESS",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84868195010

CURRENT TREATMENTS MANAGE THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, YET HAVE MINIMAL EFFECTS ON THE NEGATIVE AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, TWO PROMINENT FEATURES OF THE DISEASE WITH CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM MORBIDITY. IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. TAAR1 AGONISTS DO NOT INDUCE CATALEPSY OR WEIGHT GAIN; RO5263397 EVEN REDUCED HALOPERIDOL-INDUCED CATALEPSY AND PREVENTED OLANZAPINE FROM INCREASING BODY WEIGHT AND FAT ACCUMULATION. FINALLY, TAAR1 ACTIVATION PROMOTES VIGILANCE IN RATS AND SHOWS PRO-COGNITIVE AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE PROPERTIES IN RODENT AND PRIMATE MODELS. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9,United Kingdom,2013,10.1038/mp.2012.57,ARTICLE,"ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE;ANIMALS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS;ATTENTION;BENZODIAZEPINES;BODY WEIGHT;COCAINE;CONDITIONING, OPERANT;DEPRESSION;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS;ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY;HALLUCINOGENS;HALOPERIDOL;HUMANS;MACACA FASCICULARIS;MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING;MALE;MENTAL RECALL;MICE;MICE, INBRED C57BL;MICE, TRANSGENIC;MICROINJECTIONS;MOTOR ACTIVITY;MUTATION;OOCYTES;OXAZOLES;PHENCYCLIDINE;PHENETHYLAMINES;PROTEIN BINDING;PYRROLIDINONES;RATS;RATS, WISTAR;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY);SCHIZOPHRENIA;SWIMMING;TELEMETRY;TRITIUM;XENOPUS;2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE;ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT;BETA GALACTOSIDASE;CYCLIC AMP;HALOPERIDOL;NEUROLEPTIC AGENT;OLANZAPINE;PROTEIN;RO 5256390;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL TISSUE;ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY;AREA UNDER THE CURVE;ARTICLE;BODY WEIGHT;CATALEPSY;COGNITION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRUG BLOOD LEVEL;DRUG BRAIN LEVEL;DRUG CLEARANCE;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG HALF LIFE;DRUG POTENTIATION;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;HUMAN;HUMAN CELL;LOCOMOTION;MALE;MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION;NONHUMAN;NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING;PRIORITY JOURNAL;RAT;SCHIZOPHRENIA;TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION;WEIGHT GAIN",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84876681068

D-NEURONS, WHICH WERE DEFINED AS ""NON-MONOAMINERGIC AROMATIC L-AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE (AADC)-CONTAINING CELLS"", PRODUCE TRACE AMINES (TAS), SUCH AS TYRAMINE, PHENYLETHYLAMINE (PEA) AND TRYPTAMINE. D-NEURONS MAY ALSO TAKE UP AMINE PRECURSORS, AND MAY CONVERT THEM TO AMINES BY DECARBOXYLATION. THE AUTHOR'S PRELIMINARY REPORT SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF AADC-CONTAINING NEURONS, THAT IS D-NEURONS, WAS REDUCED IN THE STRIATUM AND NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS OF PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.

IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA, THE REDUCTION OF STRIATAL D-NEURONS AND POSSIBLE DECREASE OF STRIATAL TA, IS CAUSED BY NEURAL STEM CELL DYSFUNCTION IN THE SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE OF THE LATERAL VENTRICLE.

TAS ROLE IS UNKNOWN; HOWEVER, DISCOVERY OF THEIR RECEPTORS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THEIR FUNCTIONS. IN VIVO EVIDENCE HAS INDICATED AN INHIBITORY INFLUENCE OF TAAR1 ON DOPAMINE (DA) NEUROTRANSMISSION, PRESUMABLY VIA MODULATION OF DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (DAT) OR INTERACTION WITH THE D2 DA RECEPTOR AND/OR ACTIVATION OF INWARDLY RECTIFYING K+ CHANNELS. TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS OF TAAR1-DEPENDENT MODULATION, WE USED TAAR1 KNOCKOUT MICE (TAAR1-KO), A TAAR1 AGONIST (RO5166017) AND A TAAR1 ANTAGONIST (EPPTB) IN A SET OF NEUROCHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS. ANALYSIS OF THE TISSUE CONTENT OF TAAR1-KO REVEALED INCREASED LEVEL OF THE DA METABOLITE HOMOVANILLIC ACID (HVA), AND IN VIVO MICRODIALYSIS SHOWED INCREASED EXTRACELLULAR DA IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS (NACC) OF TAAR1-KO. IN FAST SCAN CYCLIC VOLTAMMETRY (FSCV) EXPERIMENTS, THE EVOKED DA RELEASE WAS HIGHER IN THE TAAR1-KO NACC. FURTHERMORE, THE AGONIST RO5166017 INDUCED A DECREASE IN THE DA RELEASE IN WILD-TYPE THAT COULD BE PREVENTED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE TAAR1 ANTAGONIST EPPTB. NO ALTERATIONS IN DA CLEARANCE, WHICH ARE MEDIATED BY THE DAT, WERE OBSERVED. TO EVALUATE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TAAR1 AND D2 AUTORECEPTORS, WE TESTED THE AUTORECEPTOR-MEDIATED DYNAMICS. ONLY IN WILD TYPE MICE, THE TAAR1 AGONIST WAS ABLE TO POTENTIATE QUINPIROLE-INDUCED INHIBITORY EFFECT ON DA RELEASE. FURTHERMORE, THE SHORT-TERM PLASTICITY OF DA RELEASE FOLLOWING PAIRED PULSES WAS DECREASED IN TAAR1-KO, INDICATING LESS AUTOINHIBITION OF D2 AUTORECEPTORS.

IT PROMOTES MUSCLE MASS DEVELOPMENT, LIMITS FAT DEPOSITION, AND REDUCES FEED CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, IT HAS SEVERAL UNDESIRABLE BEHAVIORAL SIDE EFFECTS IN LIVESTOCK, ESPECIALLY PIGS, INCLUDING RESTLESSNESS, AGITATION, EXCESSIVE ORAL-FACIAL MOVEMENTS, AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. NUMEROUS IN VITRO AND IN VIVO STUDIES SUGGEST RAC'S PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIONS BEGIN WITH ITS STIMULATION OF ß1- AND ß2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR-MEDIATED SIGNALING IN SKELETAL MUSCLE AND ADIPOSE TISSUE; HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY OF RAC'S PSYCHOACTIVE EFFECTS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD.

SINCE TAAR1-MEDIATED SIGNALING CAN INFLUENCE CARDIOVASCULAR TONE AND BEHAVIOR IN SEVERAL ANIMAL MODELS, OUR FINDING THAT RAC IS A FULL MTAAR1 AGONIST SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT THIS NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION INFLUENCES THE PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR OF PIGS AND OTHER SPECIES.

UNDER THE OPTIMUM CONDITIONS, THE RECOVERY VALUES OF THE TARGET ANALYTES WERE BETWEEN 70.1 AND 110%, WITH COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION BETWEEN 1.9 AND 18.4%. THE METHOD WAS VERY RELIABLE FOR THE SIMULTANEOUS DETERMINATION OF NINE Β-AGONISTS AND SIX PSYCHIATRIC DRUGS IN ANIMAL FEED. © THE AUTHOR [2013]. PUBLISHED BY OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE RECEPTOR BINDING PROFILES OF A SERIES OF NBOME DRUGS COMPARED WITH THEIR 2,5-DIMETHOXY-PHENETHYLAMINE ANALOGS (2C DRUGS) AND LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE (LSD) IN VITRO. METHODS WE INVESTIGATED THE BINDING AFFINITIES OF 2C DRUGS (2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-H, 2C-I, 2C-N, 2C-P, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-4, 2C-T-7, AND MESCALINE), THEIR NBOME ANALOGS, AND LSD AT MONOAMINE RECEPTORS AND DETERMINED FUNCTIONAL 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE-2A (5-HT2A) AND 5-HT2B RECEPTOR ACTIVATION. BINDING AT AND THE INHIBITION OF MONOAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTERS WERE ALSO DETERMINED. HUMAN CELLS THAT WERE TRANSFECTED WITH THE RESPECTIVE HUMAN RECEPTORS OR TRANSPORTERS WERE USED (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR-1 [TAAR1], IN WHICH RAT/MOUSE RECEPTORS WERE USED). RESULTS ALL OF THE COMPOUNDS POTENTLY INTERACTED WITH SEROTONERGIC 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C RECEPTORS AND RAT TAAR1 (MOST KI AND EC50: <1 ΜM). THE N-2-METHOXYBENZYL SUBSTITUTION OF 2C DRUGS INCREASED THE BINDING AFFINITY AT SEROTONERGIC 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, ADRENERGIC Α1, DOPAMINERGIC D1-3, AND HISTAMINERGIC H1 RECEPTORS AND MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS BUT REDUCED BINDING TO 5-HT1A RECEPTORS AND TAAR1. AS A RESULT, NBOME DRUGS WERE VERY POTENT 5-HT2A RECEPTOR AGONISTS (EC50: 0.04-0.5 ΜM) WITH HIGH 5-HT2A/5-HT1A SELECTIVITY AND AFFINITY FOR ADRENERGIC Α1 RECEPTORS (KI: 0.3-0.9 ΜM) AND TAAR1 (KI: 0.06-2.2 ΜM), SIMILAR TO LSD, BUT NOT DOPAMINERGIC D1-3 RECEPTORS (MOST KI: > 1 ΜM), UNLIKE LSD. CONCLUSION THE BINDING PROFILE OF NBOME DRUGS PREDICTS STRONG HALLUCINOGENIC EFFECTS, SIMILAR TO LSD, BUT POSSIBLY MORE STIMULANT PROPERTIES BECAUSE OF Α1 RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS. © 2015 ELSEVIER LTD.

MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON STUDYING THE ROLE OF TAAR1 ON MODULATION OF THE DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION. THESE STUDIES INDICATE THAT TAAR1 IS A NEGATIVE REGULATOR OF DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION MAKING TAAR1 A NOVEL TARGET FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS THAT ARISES FROM DOPAMINE DYSFUNCTION SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA.

THIS RESULTS IN ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN VIVO WHICH MIGHT BE INITIATED BY AN INTERACTION OF TAAR1 AND DOPAMINE D2L RECEPTOR (D2R). HERE WE ANALYZED THE FUNCTIONAL LINK BETWEEN TAAR1 AND D2R USING HIGHLY POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONISTS, AND NEWLY GENERATED TOOLS SUCH AS TAAR1 KNOCK-OUT AND TAAR1 OVEREXPRESSING RATS AS WELL AS SPECIFIC ANTI-RAT TAAR1 ANTIBODIES. WE PROVIDE DATA FROM CO-IMMUNOPRECIPITATION EXPERIMENTS SUPPORTING A FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION OF THE TWO RECEPTORS IN HETEROLOGOUS CELLS AND IN BRAIN TISSUE. INTERACTION OF TAAR1 WITH D2R ALTERED THE SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF TAAR1 AND INCREASED D2R AGONIST BINDING AFFINITY. USING SPECIFIC Β-ARRESTIN 2 (ΒARR2) COMPLEMENTATION ASSAYS WE SHOW THAT THE INTERACTION OF TAAR1 WITH D2R REDUCED ΒARR2 RECRUITMENT TO D2R. IN ADDITION, WE REPORT THAT BESIDES GΑS-PROTEIN SIGNALING TAAR1 ALSO SIGNALS VIA ΒARR2. IN THE PRESENCE OF D2R, CAMP SIGNALING OF TAAR1 WAS REDUCED WHILE ITS ΒARR2 SIGNALING WAS ENHANCED, RESULTING IN REDUCED GSK3Β ACTIVATION. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ΒARR2 SIGNALING MAY BE AN IMPORTANT PATHWAY FOR TAAR1 FUNCTION AND THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THE TAAR1-D2R COMPLEX NEGATIVELY MODULATES GSK3Β SIGNALING. GIVEN THAT PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR BIPOLAR DISORDER SHOW INCREASED GSK3Β SIGNALING, SUCH A REDUCTION OF GSK3Β SIGNALING TRIGGERED BY THE INTERACTION OF D2R WITH ACTIVATED TAAR1 FURTHER SUPPORTS TAAR1 AS A TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. © 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

THE TIMING OF THE MEETING'S PLENARY SESSION ON TAAR1 COINCIDED WITH THE IDES OF MARCH, AN APT CONCURRENCE GIVEN THE LONG ASSOCIATION OF THIS DATE WITH THE OVERTHROW OF THE STATUS QUO. AND WHETHER AWARE OF THE COINCIDENCE OR NOT, THOSE IN ATTENDANCE WITNESSED THE PLUNGING OF THE METAPHORICAL DAGGER INTO THE HEART OF THE DOPAMINE (DA) TRANSPORTER (DAT)-CENTRIC VIEW OF PSYCHOSTIMULANT ACTION. METHODS: THE SYMPOSIUM'S FOUR PLENARY PRESENTATIONS FOCUSED ON THE MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY, GENETICS, MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY OF THE TAAR1 SYSTEM AND THE EXPERIMENTAL USE OF NEWLY DEVELOPED SELECTIVE TAAR1 LIGANDS. RESULTS: THE CONSENSUS WAS THAT TAAR1 IS A DA AND METHAMPHETAMINE RECEPTOR, INTERACTS WITH DAT AND DA D2 RECEPTORS, AND IS ESSENTIAL IN MODULATING ADDICTION-RELATED EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSTIMULANTS. CONCLUSIONS: COLLECTIVELY THE FINDINGS PRESENTED DURING THE SYMPOSIUM CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE CURRENT VIEW THAT PSYCHOSTIMULANTS SUCH AS METHAMPHETAMINE AND AMPHETAMINE SOLELY TARGET DAT TO INTERFERE WITH NORMAL DA SIGNALING AND PROVIDE A NOVEL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FROM WHICH A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE ACTIONS OF DA AND METH IS LIKELY TO EMERGE. © 2015 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955054806&doi=10.1016%2fj.drugalcdep.2015.11.014&partnerID=40&md5=3c0c009d984b3a686d9bb02a2a3ab8f6,Netherlands,2016,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2015.11.014,REVIEW,"ANIMALS;BEHAVIOR, ADDICTIVE;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM STIMULANTS;DOPAMINE PLASMA MEMBRANE TRANSPORT PROTEINS;HUMANS;RECEPTORS, DOPAMINE D2;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;AGENTS INTERACTING WITH TRANSMITTER, HORMONE OR DRUG RECEPTORS;AMPHETAMINE;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER;DRUGS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF ADDICTION;METHAMPHETAMINE;N (3 ETHOXY PHENYL) 4 PYRROLIDIN 1 YL 3 TRIFLUOROMETHYL BENZAMIDE;PROTEIN KINASE C;RECEPTOR;RO 5203648;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 PROTEIN;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;CENTRAL STIMULANT AGENT;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;BINDING AFFINITY;CELLULAR DISTRIBUTION;DOPAMINERGIC NERVE CELL;DOSE RESPONSE;DRUG DEPENDENCE;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR;FIRING RATE;HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION;HUMAN;LOCOMOTION;NONHUMAN;PLACE PREFERENCE;PRIORITY JOURNAL;PROTEIN BINDING;PROTEIN FUNCTION;PROTEIN LOCALIZATION;PROTEIN PROTEIN INTERACTION;REINFORCEMENT;RELAPSE;REVIEW;REWARD;SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION;ADDICTION;AGONISTS;ANIMAL;ANTAGONISTS AND INHIBITORS;DRUG EFFECTS;METABOLISM",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84955054806

IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPLEMENT OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS WITH ADDITIONAL SUBSTANCES AND THE DETERMINATION OF FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION POTENCIES. IN SUMMARY, WE PRESENT HERE PHARMACOLOGICAL IN VITRO PROFILES OF 101 PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AT HUMAN, RAT, AND MOUSE TAAR1. P-TYRAMINE, B-PHENYLETHYLAMINE, AND TRYPTAMINE WERE INCLUDED AS ENDOGENOUS COMPARATOR COMPOUNDS. FUNCTIONAL CAMP MEASUREMENTS AND RADIOLIGAND DISPLACEMENT ASSAYS WERE CONDUCTED WITH HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY 293 CELLS THAT EXPRESSED HUMAN, RAT, OR MOUSE TAAR1. MOST AMPHETAMINES, PHENETHYLAMINE, AND AMINOINDANES EXHIBITED POTENTIALLY PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT RAT AND MOUSE TAAR1 ACTIVATION (EC50 < 5 ΜM) AND SHOWED FULL OR PARTIAL (EMAX < 80%) AGONIST PROPERTIES. CATHINONE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING MEPHEDRONE AND METHYLENEDIOXYPYROVALERONE, EXHIBITED WEAK (EC50 = 5-10 ΜM) TO NEGLIGIBLE (EC50 > 10 ΜM) BINDING PROPERTIES AT TAAR1. PIPRADROLS, INCLUDING METHYLPHENIDATE, EXHIBITED NO AFFINITY FOR TAAR1. WE FOUND CONSIDERABLE SPECIES DIFFERENCES IN ACTIVITY AT TAAR1 AMONG THE HIGHLY ACTIVE LIGANDS, WITH A RANK ORDER OF RAT > MOUSE > HUMAN. THIS CHARACTERIZATION PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILE OF PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES. THE SPECIES DIFFERENCES EMPHASIZE THE RELEVANCE OF CLINICAL STUDIES TO TRANSLATIONALLY COMPLEMENT RODENT STUDIES ON THE ROLE OF TAAR1 ACTIVITY FOR PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES.

THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT LITERATURE OF BOTH THE RECREATIONAL USE OF DMT AND ITS POTENTIAL ROLES AS AN ENDOGENOUS NEUROTRANSMITTER. PHARMACOKINETICS, MECHANISMS OF ACTION IN THE PERIPHERY AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, CLINICAL USES AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE ALSO REVIEWED. DMT APPEARS TO HAVE LIMITED NEUROTOXICITY AND OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS EXCEPT FOR INTENSE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS WHEN ADMINISTERED INTRAVENOUSLY IN LARGE DOSES.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS WITH THE DOPAMINE (DA) NEURONS OF THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA (VTA). USING IN-VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY IN MALE ADULT RATS, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF CUMULATIVE DOSES OF LSD ON VTA DA NEURONAL ACTIVITY, COMPARED THESE EFFECTS TO THOSE PRODUCED ON 5-HT NEURONS IN THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS (DRN), AND ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISM OF ACTION MEDIATING THE EFFECTS OF LSD ON VTA DA NEURONS. LSD, AT LOW DOSES (5–20 ΜG/KG, I.V.) INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF DRN 5-HT FIRING ACTIVITY THROUGH 5-HT2A AND D2 RECEPTORS. AT THESE LOW DOSES, LSD DID NOT ALTER VTA DA NEURONAL ACTIVITY. ON THE CONTRARY, AT HIGHER DOSES (30–120 ΜG/KG, I.V.), LSD DOSE-DEPENDENTLY DECREASED VTA DA FIRING ACTIVITY. THE DEPLETION OF 5-HT WITH P-CHLOROPHENYLALANINE DID NOT MODULATE THE EFFECTS OF LSD ON DA FIRING ACTIVITY. THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF LSD ON VTA DA FIRING ACTIVITY WERE PREVENTED BY THE D2 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST HALOPERIDOL (50 ΜG/KG, I.V.) AND BY THE 5-HT1A RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST WAY-100,635 (500 ΜG/KG, I.V.). NOTABLY, PRETREATMENT WITH THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) ANTAGONIST EPPTB (5 MG/KG, I.V.) BLOCKED THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF LSD ON VTA DA NEURONS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LSD AT HIGH DOSES STRONGLY AFFECTS DA MESOLIMBIC NEURONAL ACTIVITY IN A 5-HT INDEPENDENT MANNER AND WITH A PLEIOTROPIC MECHANISM OF ACTION INVOLVING 5-HT1A, D2 AND TAAR1 RECEPTORS. © 2016 ELSEVIER LTD",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84982206824&doi=10.1016%2fj.phrs.2016.08.022&partnerID=40&md5=2962d2d2f5205850449358c5e7a6c9df,Netherlands,2016,10.1016/j.phrs.2016.08.022,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;BENZAMIDES;DOPAMINE;HALLUCINOGENS;LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE;MALE;NEURONS;PIPERAZINES;PYRIDINES;PYRROLIDINES;RATS;RATS, SPRAGUE-DAWLEY;RECEPTOR, SEROTONIN, 5-HT1A;RECEPTORS, DOPAMINE D2;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;SEROTONIN;VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA;ALPHA (2,3 DIMETHOXYPHENYL) 1 [2 (4 FLUOROPHENYL)ETHYL] 4 PIPERINEMETHANOL;BENZAMIDE;DOPAMINE;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;FENCLONINE;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;HALOPERIDOL;LYSERGIDE;N (3 ETHOXYPHENYL) 4 (1 PYRROLIDINYL) 3 (TRIFLUOROMETHYL)BENZAMIDE;SEROTONIN 1A ANTAGONIST;SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATE RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;WAY 100 635;BENZAMIDE DERIVATIVE;DOPAMINE;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;LYSERGIDE;N-(2-(4-(2-METHOXYPHENYL)-1-PIPERAZINYL)ETHYL)-N-(2-PYRIDINYL)CYCLOHEXANECARBOXAMIDE;N-(3-ETHOXYPHENYL)-4-PYRROLIDIN-1-YL-3-TRIFLUOROMETHYLBENZAMIDE;PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVE;PSYCHEDELIC AGENT;PYRIDINE DERIVATIVE;PYRROLIDINE DERIVATIVE;SEROTONIN;SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;ADULT;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ARTICLE;BRAIN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY;BRAIN NERVE CELL;CELL ACTIVITY;CONTROLLED STUDY;DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DRUG CLEARANCE;DRUG MECHANISM;ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES;FIRING RATE;IN VIVO STUDY;MALE;MOUSE;NONHUMAN;PRIORITY JOURNAL;SINGLE DRUG DOSE;VENTRAL TEGMENTUM;ANIMAL;DRUG EFFECTS;METABOLISM;NERVE CELL;RAT;SPRAGUE DAWLEY RAT",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84982206824

IT IS INDEED USED AS A PHARMACOLOGICAL MODEL OF PSYCHOSIS IN PRECLINICAL RESEARCH. THE GOAL OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PSYCHOTIC-LIKE EFFECTS OF LSD. WE SEARCHED PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, GOOGLE SCHOLAR AND ARTICLES’ REFERENCE LISTS FOR PRECLINICAL STUDIES REGARDING THE MECHANISM OF ACTION INVOLVED IN THE PSYCHOTIC-LIKE EFFECTS INDUCED BY LSD. LSD’S MECHANISM OF ACTION IS PLEIOTROPIC, PRIMARILY MEDIATED BY THE SEROTONERGIC SYSTEM IN THE DORSAL RAPHE, BINDING THE 5-HT2A RECEPTOR AS A PARTIAL AGONIST AND 5-HT1A AS AN AGONIST. LSD ALSO MODULATES THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, AT HIGHER DOSES, BY STIMULATING DOPAMINE D2, TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT2A. MORE STUDIES CLARIFYING THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF THE PSYCHOTIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS OR PSYCHOSIS INDUCED BY LSD IN HUMANS ARE NEEDED. LSD’S EFFECTS ARE MEDIATED BY A PLEIOTROPIC MECHANISM INVOLVING SEROTONERGIC, DOPAMINERGIC, AND GLUTAMATERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION. THUS, THE LSD-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS IS A USEFUL MODEL TO TEST THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF POTENTIAL NOVEL ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUGS, PARTICULARLY DRUGS WITH DUAL SEROTONERGIC AND DOPAMINERGIC (DA) MECHANISM OR ACTING ON TAAR1 RECEPTORS. © 2016 BY THE AUTHORS; LICENSEE MDPI, BASEL, SWITZERLAND.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84997261239&doi=10.3390%2fijms17111953&partnerID=40&md5=987aa3b7046605ec2fd0215af304c8fe,Switzerland,2016,10.3390/ijms17111953,REVIEW,"ANIMALS;ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS;BEHAVIOR, ANIMAL;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOPAMINE;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DRUG EVALUATION, PRECLINICAL;HALLUCINOGENS;HUMANS;LYSERGIC ACID DIETHYLAMIDE;PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS;RATS;RECEPTOR, SEROTONIN, 5-HT1A;RECEPTOR, SEROTONIN, 5-HT2A;RECEPTORS, DOPAMINE;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;RECEPTORS, GLUTAMATE;SEROTONIN RECEPTOR AGONISTS;SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION;VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA;4 AMINOBUTYRIC ACID A RECEPTOR;BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR;BROMOLYSERGIDE;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;GLUTAMIC ACID;GLUTATHIONE TRANSFERASE;MEMBRANE PROTEIN;MESSENGER RNA;N METHYL DEXTRO ASPARTIC ACID RECEPTOR 2A;PHENETHYLAMINE;SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR;SEROTONIN 2A RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATE RECEPTOR 1;TRYPTAMINE;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;DOPAMINE;DOPAMINE RECEPTOR;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR;LYSERGIDE;NEUROLEPTIC AGENT;PSYCHEDELIC AGENT;SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR;SEROTONIN 2A RECEPTOR;SEROTONIN AGONIST;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;BINDING AFFINITY;DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM;HUMAN;MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY;NEUROTRANSMISSION;NONHUMAN;PREFRONTAL CORTEX;PREPULSE INHIBITION DISRUPTION TEST;PROTEIN BINDING;PROTEIN EXPRESSION;PSYCHOSIS;REVIEW;SCHIZOPHRENIA;SEROTONINERGIC SYSTEM;VENTRAL TEGMENTUM;ANIMAL;ANIMAL BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODEL;DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS;DRUG EFFECTS;METABOLISM;PATHOPHYSIOLOGY;PRECLINICAL STUDY;PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS;RAT;SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-84997261239

IAAS ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED THE MOST THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED GROUP OF AROMATIC AMINES IN THE AMPHIBIAN SKIN. ON THE CONTRARY, AT PRESENT THE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THESE COMPOUNDS IN LOWER ORGANISMS IS STILL LIMITED AND THE BIOGENIC AMINE RECEPTORS, MEDIATING HORMONAL AND MODULATORY FUNCTIONS, ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN IN PRIMITIVE INVERTEBRATES. HOWEVER, SOME AC-TIVE RESEARCH IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY INVESTIGATING THIS CLASS OF BIOGENIC AMINES. NOTABLY, DURING THE LAST THREE DECADES SEVERAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF ENDOGENOUS BIOGENIC AMINES IN CNIDARIANS, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE THE LOWEST BEINGS EQUIPPED WITH AN EFFECTIVE, EVEN THOUGH RUDIMENTARY, NERVOUS SYSTEM. TOADS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM THE BUFONIDAE FAMILY, CONSTITUTE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE AMPHIBIAN FAMILY AND ARE AN IDENTIFIED SOURCE OF IAAS. TO DATE FOURTEEN IAAS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE SKINS OF TOAD SPECIES. ALL ARE 5-SUBSTITUTED IAA DERIVATIVES ACTING MAINLY ON THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS), WITH MOST EXHIBITING SOME DEGREES OF 5-HT2A RECEPTOR SELECTIVITY. THIS SELECTIVE ABILITY PRESENTS POTENTIAL FOR THEIR USE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR VARIOUS DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDERS AND CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME IAAS MAY ALSO SHOW SUBCLASS SELECTIVITY THROUGH BINDING TO MULTIPLE 5-HT RECEPTOR SUBTYPES. THUS, THERE EXISTS AN ADDITIONAL PROMISING PLATFORM FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THERAPEUTICS TARGETING MULTIPLE 5-HT RECEPTORS. IN THIS REVIEW, IAAS OCCURRING NATURALLY IN VARIOUS SPECIES OF TOAD SKINS, WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND ISOLATED SINCE 1944 ARE SUMMARIZED AND COMPARISONS ARE MADE WITH SIMILAR BIOGENIC AMINES RECOGNIZED IN CNIDARIANS TO DATE. SUCH COMPARISONS HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL TO UTILIZE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE GATHERED FROM VERTEBRATES, SUCH AS TOADS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ACTIVITIES OF SUCH COMPOUNDS IN LOWER INVERTEBRATES. © 2016 BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBLISHERS.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85013717446&doi=10.2174%2f1871524915666150724100245&partnerID=40&md5=dc9db33ede2cd2ff5f0875466b802641,United Arab Emirates,2016,10.2174/1871524915666150724100245,ARTICLE,ANIMALS;ANURA;BIOGENIC AMINES;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM;CNIDARIA;HUMANS;INDOLES;INVERTEBRATES;SKIN;VERTEBRATES;BIOGENIC AMINE;INDOLEACETIC ACID;SEROTONIN RECEPTOR;BIOGENIC AMINE;INDOLE DERIVATIVE;AMPHIBIA;ANXIETY;ARTICLE;BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY;BUFONIDAE;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM;CHRONIC PAIN;CNIDARIA;DEPRESSION;OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER;SCHIZOPHRENIA;ANIMAL;ANURA;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM;CHEMISTRY;CNIDARIA;DRUG EFFECTS;HUMAN;INVERTEBRATE;ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION;SKIN;VERTEBRATE,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85013717446

BECAUSE OF THEIR PSYCHEDELIC EFFECTS, 2C-T DRUGS ARE SOMETIMES SOLD AS NEW PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES (NPSS). THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE MONOAMINE RECEPTOR AND TRANSPORTER INTERACTION PROFILES OF A SERIES OF 2C-T DRUGS. METHODS: WE DETERMINED THE BINDING AFFINITIES OF 2C-T DRUGS AT MONOAMINE RECEPTORS AND TRANSPORTERS IN HUMAN CELLS THAT WERE TRANSFECTED WITH THE RESPECTIVE RECEPTORS OR TRANSPORTERS. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION OF SEROTONERGIC 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE 2A (5-HT2A) AND 5-HT2B RECEPTORS, ACTIVATION OF HUMAN TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), AND INHIBITION OF MONOAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTERS. RESULTS: 2C-T DRUGS HAD HIGH AFFINITY FOR 5-HT2A AND 5-HT2C RECEPTORS (1–54 NM AND 40–350 NM, RESPECTIVELY). WITH ACTIVATION POTENCIES OF 1–53 NM AND 44–370 NM, THE DRUGS WERE POTENT 5-HT2A RECEPTOR AND 5-HT2B RECEPTOR, RESPECTIVELY, PARTIAL AGONISTS. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS WERE THE BENZYLTHIOPHENETHYLAMINES, WHICH DID NOT POTENTLY ACTIVATE THE 5-HT2B RECEPTOR (EC50 > 3000 NM). FURTHERMORE, THE COMPOUNDS BOUND TO SEROTONERGIC 5-HT1A AND ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS. THE COMPOUNDS HAD HIGH AFFINITY FOR THE RAT TAAR1 (5–68 NM) AND INTERACTED WITH THE MOUSE BUT NOT HUMAN TAAR1. THE 2C-T DRUGS DID NOT POTENTLY INTERACT WITH MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS (KI > 4000 NM). CONCLUSION: THE RECEPTOR BINDING PROFILE OF 2C-T DRUGS PREDICTS PSYCHEDELIC EFFECTS THAT ARE MEDIATED BY POTENT 5-HT2 RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS.

CONSEQUENTLY THE DEVELOPMENT OF BASIC TOOLS FOR PROBING TAAR AND TRANSLATING FINDINGS FROM MODEL SYSTEMS TO HUMANS HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES THE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE SEEN CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO TAAR1, WHICH APPEARS TO FUNCTION AS AN ENDOGENOUS RHEOSTAT, MAINTAINING CENTRAL NEUROTRANSMISSION WITHIN DEFINED PHYSIOLOGICAL LIMITS, IN PART THROUGH RECEPTOR HETERODIMERIZATION YIELDING BIASED SIGNALING OUTPUTS. REGULATION OF THE DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY WELL UNDERSTOOD AND CLINICAL TESTING OF TAAR1 DIRECTED LIGANDS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS HAVE BEGUN. IN ADDITION, PRE-CLINICAL ANIMAL MODELS HAVE IDENTIFIED TAAR1 AS A NOVEL TARGET FOR DRUG ADDICTION AND METABOLIC DISORDERS. GROWING EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS A ROLE FOR TAARS IN REGULATING IMMUNE FUNCTION. THIS REVIEW CRITICALLY DISCUSSES THE CURRENT STATE OF TAAR RESEARCH, HIGHLIGHTING RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND FOCUSSING ON HUMAN TAARS, THEIR FUNCTIONS, AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE PHARMACOLOGY OF METHYLPHENIDATE-BASED SUBSTANCES IN VITRO. METHODS: WE DETERMINED THE POTENCIES OF THE METHYLPHENIDATE-BASED NPS N-BENZYLETHYLPHENIDATE, 3,4-DICHLOROETHYLPHENIDATE, 3,4-DICHLOROMETHYLPHENIDATE, ETHYLNAPHTHIDATE, ETHYLPHENIDATE, 4-FLUOROMETHYLPHENIDATE, ISOPROPYLPHENIDATE, 4-METHYLMETHYLPHENIDATE, METHYLMORPHENATE, AND PROPYLPHENIDATE AND THE POTENCIES OF THE RELATED COMPOUNDS COCAINE AND MODAFINIL WITH RESPECT TO NOREPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE, AND SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER INHIBITION IN TRANSPORTER-TRANSFECTED HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY 293 CELLS. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED MONOAMINE EFFLUX AND MONOAMINE RECEPTOR AND TRANSPORTER BINDING AFFINITIES. FURTHERMORE, WE ASSESSED THE CELL INTEGRITY UNDER ASSAY CONDITIONS. RESULTS: ALL METHYLPHENIDATE-BASED SUBSTANCES INHIBITED THE NOREPINEPHRINE AND DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS 4 TO >1000-FOLD MORE POTENTLY THAN THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER. SIMILAR TO METHYLPHENIDATE AND COCAINE, METHYLPHENIDATE-BASED NPS DID NOT ELICIT TRANSPORTER-MEDIATED EFFLUX OF MONOAMINES. BESIDES BINDING TO MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS, SEVERAL TEST DRUGS HAD AFFINITY FOR ADRENERGIC, SEROTONERGIC, AND RAT TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTORS BUT NOT FOR DOPAMINERGIC OR MOUSE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTORS. NO CYTOTOXICITY WAS OBSERVED AFTER DRUG TREATMENT AT ASSAY CONCENTRATIONS. CONCLUSION: METHYLPHENIDATE-BASED SUBSTANCES HAD PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILES SIMILAR TO METHYLPHENIDATE AND COCAINE. THE PREDOMINANT ACTIONS ON DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS VS. SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS MAY BE RELEVANT WHEN CONSIDERING ABUSE LIABILITY.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILING OF SUCH NEWLY EMERGED DRUGS IS CRUCIAL FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS AND TOXICITY. WE THEREFORE INVESTIGATED THE POTENTIAL OF THESE NPSS TO INHIBIT THE NOREPINEPHRINE, DOPAMINE, AND SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS IN HUMAN EMBRYONIC KIDNEY CELLS STABLY TRANSFECTED WITH THE RESPECTIVE TRANSPORTERS. IN ADDITION, WE DETERMINED MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER AND RECEPTOR AFFINITIES FOR THE SUBSTANCES. DICLOFENSINE POTENTLY BOUND TO THE MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS IN THE SUBMICROMOLAR RANGE AND HAD SIMILAR INHIBITION POTENTIAL FOR ALL THREE TRANSPORTERS IN THE RANGE OF 2.5–4.8 ΜM. MOREOVER, DICLOFENSINE BOUND TO ADRENERGIC, DOPAMINE, SEROTONIN, AND TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTORS. DIPHENIDINE WAS AN EQUIPOTENT INHIBITOR OF THE NOREPINEPHRINE AND DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS IN THE LOW MICROMOLAR RANGE AND A VERY WEAK INHIBITOR OF THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER. BESIDES BINDING TO TRANSPORTERS, DIPHENIDINE BOUND TO ADRENERGIC Α1A AND Α2A RECEPTORS AND SEROTONIN 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE 1A (5-HT1A) AND 5-HT2A RECEPTORS IN THE RANGE OF 4–11 ΜM. METHOXPHENIDINE BOUND TO ALL TRANSPORTERS, BUT CONSIDERABLE INHIBITION (IC50 < 10 ΜM) WAS OBSERVED ONLY FOR THE NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER. MOREOVER, METHOXPHENIDINE BOUND TO ADRENERGIC Α2A AND SEROTONIN 5-HT2A AND 5-HT2C RECEPTORS IN THE RANGE OF 2.5–8.2 ΜM. NONE OF THE TEST DRUGS MEDIATED SUBSTRATE-TYPE EFFLUX OF MONOAMINES.

HUMANS POSSESS SIX FUNCTIONAL ISOFORMS (TAAR1, TAAR2, TAAR5, TAAR6, TAAR8, AND TAAR9), WHEREAS SOME FISH SPECIES EXPRESS OVER 100. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TAAR1, TAARS ARE EXPRESSED IN OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM NEURONS, WHERE THEY DETECT DIVERSE ETHOLOGICAL SIGNALS INCLUDING PREDATORS, SPOILED FOOD, MIGRATORY CUES, AND PHEROMONES. OUTSIDE THE OLFACTORY SYSTEM, TAAR1 IS THE MOST THOROUGHLY STUDIED AND HAS BOTH CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL ROLES. IN THE BRAIN, TAAR1 ACTS AS A RHEOSTAT OF DOPAMINERGIC, GLUTAMATERGIC, AND SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION AND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA, DEPRESSION, AND ADDICTION. IN THE PERIPHERY, TAAR1 REGULATES NUTRIENT-INDUCED HORMONE SECRETION, SUGGESTING ITS POTENTIAL AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR DIABETES AND OBESITY. TAAR1 MAY ALSO REGULATE IMMUNE RESPONSES BY REGULATING LEUKOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION AND ACTIVATION. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVOLUTION, PHYSIOLOGIC FUNCTIONS, PHARMACOLOGY, MOLECULAR MECHANISMS, AND THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF TRACE AMINES AND THEIR RECEPTORS IN VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES. © 2018 BY THE AUTHOR(S).",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049182757&doi=10.1124%2fpr.117.015305&partnerID=40&md5=4f935767fa10dcd1f85192dcc42ba88d,United States,2018,10.1124/pr.117.015305,ARTICLE,"AMINES;ANIMALS;HUMANS;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;SMELL;3 IODOTHYRONAMINE;ADENYLATE CYCLASE;ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR STIMULATING AGENT;AMINE;AROMATIC LEVO AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE;BETA ARRESTIN 2;DOPAMINE 2 RECEPTOR;G PROTEIN COUPLED INWARDLY RECTIFYING POTASSIUM CHANNEL;N (3 ETHOXYPHENYL) 4 (1 PYRROLIDINYL) 3 (TRIFLUOROMETHYL)BENZAMIDE;OCTOPAMINE;PARTIAL AGONIST;PHENETHYLAMINE;POLYAMINE;RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 2;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 3;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 4;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 5;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 7;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 8;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 9;TRIMETHYLAMINE;TRYPTAMINE;TYRAMINE;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;AMINE;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;ADDICTION;ALTERNATIVE RNA SPLICING;ARTICLE;BEHAVIOR;BIPOLAR DISORDER;CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECT;CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM;COGNITION;COMPULSION;DEGRADATION;DEPRESSION;DIABETES MELLITUS;DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM;ENERGY METABOLISM;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;FOOD;GENETIC CONSERVATION;GLUTAMATERGIC SYNAPSE;HORMONE RELEASE;HUMAN;IMMUNE RESPONSE;IMMUNOMODULATION;INVERTEBRATE;MALIGNANT NEOPLASM;MEMBRANE;METABOLIC SYNDROME X;METABOLISM;MICROFLORA;MOLECULAR EVOLUTION;MOLECULAR INTERACTION;NARCOLEPSY;NEUROTRANSMISSION;NONHUMAN;OBESITY;OLFACTORY EPITHELIUM;OLFACTORY SYSTEM;PREGNANCY;PRIORITY JOURNAL;PROTEIN EXPRESSION;SCHIZOPHRENIA;SEROTONINERGIC SYSTEM;SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION;SMELLING;SYNTHESIS;TELEOST;TETRAPOD;THERMOREGULATION;THROMBOCYTE ACTIVATION;ANIMAL;ODOR",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85049182757

WHILE SELECTIVE AGONISTS FOR TAAR1 HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED, ONLY ONE HIGH AFFINITY TAAR1 ANTAGONIST HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THUS FAR. WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FOUR POTENTIAL LOW POTENCY TAAR1 ANTAGONISTS THROUGH AN IN SILICO SCREEN ON A TAAR1 HOMOLOGY MODEL. ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED ANTAGONISTS (COMPOUND 22) WAS PREDICTED TO HAVE FAVORABLE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DRUG TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. IN VIVO STUDIES WERE THEREFORE CARRIED OUT AND SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 POTENTIATES AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMPOUND 22 INCREASED FIRING OF DOPAMINE NEURONS SIMILAR TO EPPTB, THE ONLY KNOWN TAAR1 ANTAGONIST. IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE EFFECTS OF COMPOUND 22 WERE MEDIATED THROUGH TAAR1, EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON TAAR1-KO MICE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 IS ABLE TO ENHANCE AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY, EVEN IN TAAR1-KO MICE, SUGGESTING THAT THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF THIS COMPOUND ARE NOT MEDIATED BY TAAR1. IN COLLABORATION WITH PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM, WE ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22. PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM (PDSP) RESULTS SUGGESTED SEVERAL POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22 INCLUDING, THE DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE AND SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; AS WELL AS SIGMA 1 AND 2 RECEPTORS. OUR FOLLOW-UP STUDIES USING HETEROLOGOUS CELL SYSTEMS SHOWED THAT THE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER IS NOT A TARGET OF COMPOUND 22.

TAAR1 ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED TO PLAY A MODULATORY ROLE IN THE DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM. IN SPITE OF A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDIES OF TAAR1 EFFECTS, LITTLE IS STILL KNOWN ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY OF TAAR1 LIGANDS, INCLUDING EFFECTS OF REPEATED TAAR1 AGONIST ADMINISTRATION. THE PRESENT STUDY APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST THAT ESTIMATED THE ACTION OF TAAR1 AGONISTS ON SCHEDULE-INDUCED POLYDIPSIA, A TYPE OF ADJUNCTIVE BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL FOR EVALUATING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS (OCD) AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. OUR RESULTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WIDE RANGE OF RO5263397, THE HIGHLY SELECTIVE PARTIAL TAAR1 AGONIST, DOSES (1–10 MG/KG) ATTENUATED THE POLYDIPSIA INDUCED BY TWO DIFFERENT SCHEDULES OF FOOD DELIVERY IN RATS. THE EFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR THE 7 DAYS OF REPEATED TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE HIGHEST TESTED DOSES OF RO5263397 (6 AND 10 MG/KG) DECREASED THE VERTICAL LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY OF THE ANIMALS AND THE VOLUME OF WATER INTAKE OF THIRSTY RATS FOLLOWING THE ACUTE TREATMENT. ALSO, THOUGH, THE REPEATED RO5263397 ADMINISTRATION IS EXHIBITED TO DIMINISH THE VOLUME OF CONSUMED WATER AND WEIGHT OF RATS WITHOUT SIP, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TOLERANCE WAS OBSERVED TO THESE DRUG EFFECTS. IN GENERAL, THE RO5263397 DECREASES SPECIFICALLY THE ADJUNCTIVE DRINKING AND THIS EFFECT IS MAINTAINED WITH REPEATED DRUG ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOLERANCE. THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS AS AN EVIDENCE FOR THE RO5263397 ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE ACTION, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION BECAUSE THE DRUG ALSO INFLUENCED THE DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND ONLY WEAKLY AFFECTED THE OTHER PARAMETERS OF SIP USED TO REVEAL THE POTENTIAL ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE EFFECTS OF DRUGS. © 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055719905&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuropharm.2018.10.034&partnerID=40&md5=00d6c2db2f6fc4e4ea0852ffc0b36e87,Netherlands,2019,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.10.034,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP, DRUG;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;MALE;MOTOR ACTIVITY;NEUROTRANSMITTER AGENTS;OXAZOLES;POLYDIPSIA;RATS, WISTAR;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;TIME FACTORS;4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYLPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 AMINE;DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AFFECTING AGENT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;4-(3-FLUORO-2-METHYLPHENYL)-4,5-DIHYDROOXAZOL-2-YLAMINE;AGENTS INTERACTING WITH TRANSMITTER, HORMONE OR DRUG RECEPTORS;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;OXAZOLE DERIVATIVE;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ANTICOMPULSIVE LIKE EFFECT;ARTICLE;COMPULSION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MECHANISM;DRUG SELECTIVITY;DRUG TOLERANCE;EVENING DOSAGE;FLUID INTAKE;FOOD INTAKE;LOCOMOTION;MALE;MORNING DOSAGE;NONHUMAN;POLYDIPSIA;PRIORITY JOURNAL;RAT;RECEPTOR UPREGULATION;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;TREATMENT DURATION;AGONISTS;ANIMAL;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODEL;DOSE RESPONSE;DRUG EFFECT;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;METABOLISM;MOTOR ACTIVITY;PHYSIOLOGY;POLYDIPSIA;TIME FACTOR;WISTAR RAT",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85055719905

TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL MODULATORY INFLUENCE OF A SPECIFIC RECEPTOR FOR TRACE AMINES TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 5 (TAAR5) ON THE DOPAMINE SYSTEM, WE USED HPLC MEASUREMENTS OF DOPAMINE AND ITS METABOLITES IN THE MOUSE STRIATUM FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUTATIVE TAAR5 AGONIST Α-NETA. ADMINISTRATION OF Α-NETA CAUSED SIGNIFICANT MODULATION OF DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM AS EVIDENCED BY AN ALTERED DOPAMINE TURNOVER RATE IN THE STRIATUM. THEN, TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL MODULATORY INFLUENCE OF TAAR5 ON THE RAT BRAIN GAMMA RHYTHM, WE INVESTIGATED THE CHANGES OF ELECTROCORTICOGRAM (ECOG) SPECTRAL POWER IN THE GAMMA-FREQUENCY RANGE (40–50 HZ) FOLLOWING ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUTATIVE TAAR5 AGONIST Α-NETA. IN ADDITION, WE ANALYZED THE CHANGES OF SPATIAL SYNCHRONIZATION OF GAMMA OSCILLATIONS OF RAT ECOG BY MULTICHANNEL RECORDING. SIGNIFICANT COMPLEX CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN THE ECOG SPECTRUM, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE SPECTRAL POWER IN THE RANGES OF DELTA (1 HZ), THETA (7 HZ), AND GAMMA RHYTHMS (40–50 HZ) AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF Α-NETA. FURTHERMORE, A DECREASE IN THE SPATIAL SYNCHRONIZATION OF GAMMA OSCILLATIONS OF 40-50 HZ AND ITS INCREASE FOR THETA OSCILLATIONS OF 7 HZ WERE DETECTED AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF Α-NETA.

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY. BASED ON THE PRECLINICAL DATA AND ITS UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, SEP-856 IS A PROMISING NEW AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND REPRESENTS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS EXPECTED TO LACK THE SIDE EFFECTS STEMMING FROM BLOCKADE OF D2 SIGNALING.

GENES CODING FOR TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTORS (TAARS) REPRESENT A MULTIGENE FAMILY OF G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS, CLUSTERED TO A SMALL GENOMIC REGION OF 108 KB LOCATED IN CHROMOSOME 6Q23, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFIED BY LINKAGE ANALYSES AS A SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA AND AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. MOST TAARS ARE EXPRESSED IN BRAIN AREAS INVOLVED IN EMOTIONS, REWARD AND COGNITION. TAARS ARE ACTIVATED BY ENDOGENOUS TRACE AMINES AND THYRONAMINES, AND EVIDENCE FOR A MODULATORY ACTION ON OTHER MONAMINERGIC SYSTEMS HAS BEEN REPORTED. THEREFORE, LINKAGE ANALYSES WERE FOLLOWED BY FINE MAPPING ASSOCIATION STUDIES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE REPORTS HAS RECEIVED SUFFICIENT UNIVERSAL REPLICATION, SO THEIR STATUS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS IN TAARS HAVE EMERGED AS SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCI FROM GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES INVESTIGATING MIGRAINE AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT, BUT NONE OF THE DETECTED VARIANTS REACHED THE THRESHOLD FOR GENOME-WIDE SIGNIFICANCE. IN THE LAST DECADE, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES ENABLED SINGLE-GENE OR WHOLE-EXOME SEQUENCING, THUS ALLOWING THE DETECTION OF RARE GENETIC VARIANTS, WHICH MAY HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE RISK OF COMPLEX DISORDERS. USING THESE APPROACHES, SEVERAL TAARS (ESPECIALLY TAAR1) VARIANTS HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN PATIENTS WITH MENTAL AND METABOLIC DISORDERS, AND IN SOME CASES, DEFECTIVE RECEPTOR FUNCTION HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN VITRO.

INJECTIONS OF Α-NETA INCREASED POWER IN THE Δ RANGE (0–5 HZ) AND THERE WAS A LINKED DECREASE IN POWER IN THE RANGE 5–10 HZ. THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN IN THE FIRST 10 MIN. NO CHANGES OCCURRED AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL SALINE. INCREASES IN SLOW WAVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY DECREASES IN SPATIAL SYNCHRONIZATION OF Γ OSCILLATIONS BETWEEN ALL SIX RECORDING POINTS FROM THE PRE-INJECTION BASELINE AS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. ALL EFFECTS WERE MORE MARKED IN THE ANTERIOR ZONES OF THE CORTEX. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT Α-NETA ALTERS DOPAMINE TRANSMISSION VIA INFL UENCES ON TAAR5, WHICH IN TURN DISRUPTS GLUTAMATERGIC TRANSMISSION, LEADING TO DYSFUNCTION IN Γ SYNCHRONIZATION, AS OCCURS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. © 2020, SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079416414&doi=10.1007%2fs11055-020-00905-2&partnerID=40&md5=45ead6fc1e03a3f6bbc62bee8f0dd07c,Germany,2020,10.1007/s11055-020-00905-2,ARTICLE,(2 (ALPHA NAPHTHOYL)ETHYLTRIMETHYLAMMONIUM IODIDE);DOPAMINE RECEPTOR STIMULATING AGENT;METHYLAMMONIUM;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 5 AGONIST;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;ADULT;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ARTICLE;BRAIN CORTEX;CONTROLLED STUDY;DOPAMINERGIC TRANSMISSION;ELECTROCORTICOGRAPHY;ELECTRODE IMPLANTATION;HEMISPHERE;MALE;NONHUMAN;RAT;RAT MODEL;SCHIZOPHRENIA;TOPOGRAPHY;WISTAR RAT,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85079416414

AN OPPOSITE EFFECT HAS BEEN FOUND FOR THE P80 COMPONENT: THE AMPLITUDE INCREASED IN RESPONSE BOTH TO STANDARD AND DEVIANT STIMULI. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN N40 PEAK LATENCY AFTER THE ALPHA-NETA ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FOUND.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST.

THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT COMPLETELY KNOWN; HOWEVER, IT INVOLVES MANY NEUROTRANSMITTERS AND THEIR RECEPTORS. IN ORDER TO TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA, DRUGS NEED TO BE MULTI-TARGET DRUGS. INDEED, THE ACTION OF SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTICS INVOLVES INTERACTIONS WITH MANY RECEPTORS, BELONGING MAINLY TO AMINERGIC GPCRS. AREAS COVERED: IN THIS REVIEW, THE AUTHORS SUMMARIZE CURRENT CONCEPTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH THE EMPHASIS ON THE MODERN DOPAMINERGIC, SEROTONINERGIC, AND GLUTAMATERGIC HYPOTHESES. NEXT, THEY DISCUSS TREATMENTS OF THE DISEASE, STRESSING MULTI-TARGET ANTIPSYCHOTICS. THEY COVER DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF DESIGN OF MULTI-TARGET LIGANDS, INCLUDING THE APPLICATION OF MOLECULAR MODELING APPROACHES FOR THE DESIGN AND BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPOUNDS. FINALLY, THEY PRESENT SUCCESSFUL CASE STUDIES OF MULTI-TARGET DRUG DESIGN AGAINST SCHIZOPHRENIA. EXPERT OPINION: TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF MULTI-TARGET DRUGS. WHILE DESIGNING SINGLE TARGET DRUGS IS RELATIVELY EASY, DESIGNING MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPOUNDS IS A CHALLENGE DUE TO THE NECESSITY TO BALANCE THE AFFINITY TO MANY TARGETS, WHILE AVOIDING PROMISCUITY AND THE PROBLEMS WITH DRUG-LIKENESS.

SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES. LASTLY, SEP-856 ACUTE ADMINISTRATION CORRECTED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS PRODUCED BY SUBCHRONIC PCP ADMINISTRATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA PROVIDE FURTHER INSIGHTS ON SEP-856, SUGGESTING THAT MODULATION OF THE PFC MAY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR THE FUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVITY OF THIS NOVEL COMPOUND. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

ALTHOUGH ANTIPSYCHOTICS REDUCE PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS IN MANY PATIENTS, THEY INDUCE NUMEROUS UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS AND ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AGAINST NEGATIVE AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS. THESE HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO DEVELOP NEW DRUGS TO TREAT SCZ. AN ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCUITRY OF SCZ HAS POINTED TO PATHOLOGICAL ORIGINS IN THE EXCITATION/INHIBITION BALANCE IN REGIONS SUCH AS THE HIPPOCAMPUS, AND RESTORING FUNCTION IN THIS REGION, PARTICULARLY AS A MEANS TO COMPENSATE FOR PARVALBUMIN (PV) INTERNEURON LOSS AND RESULTANT HIPPOCAMPAL HYPERACTIVITY, MAY BE A MORE EFFICACIOUS APPROACH TO RELIEVE A BROAD RANGE OF SCZ SYMPTOMS. OTHER TARGETS, SUCH AS CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS AND THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), HAVE ALSO SHOWN SOME PROMISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCZ. IMPORTANTLY, ASSESSING EFFICACY OF NOVEL COMPOUNDS MUST TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TREATMENT HISTORY OF THE PATIENT, AS PRECLINICAL STUDIES SUGGEST PRIOR ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT MAY INTERFERE WITH THE EFFICACY OF THESE NOVEL AGENTS. HOWEVER, WHILE NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING SCZ, A MORE EFFECTIVE APPROACH WOULD BE TO PREVENT THE TRANSITION TO SCZ IN SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS. A FOCUS ON STRESS, WHICH HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A PREDISPOSING FACTOR IN RISK FOR SCZ, IS A POSSIBLE AVENUE THAT HAS SHOWN PROMISE IN PRECLINICAL STUDIES. THEREFORE, THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES BASED ON OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE CIRCUITRY OF SCZ AND ITS ETIOLOGY ARE LIKELY TO ENABLE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS COMPLEX DISORDER. © 2021 BY THE AUTHORS.

UNLIKE AVAILABLE ANTIPSYCHOTICS, THE EFFICACY OF ULOTARONT IS NOT MEDIATED BY BLOCKADE OF DOPAMINE D2 OR SEROTONIN 5-HT2A RECEPTORS. IN A SHORT-TERM RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, ULOTARONT HAS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT EFFICACY IN THE TREATMENT OF ADULTS WITH AN ACUTE EXACERBATION OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. GIVEN ULOTARONT'S NOVEL MECHANISM OF ACTION A SERIES OF PRECLINICAL STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE ITS POTENTIAL ABUSE LIABILITY. METHODS: A BATTERY OF STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN MALE AND FEMALE RATS TO EVALUATE WHETHER ULOTARONT PRODUCES BEHAVIORAL CHANGES SUGGESTIVE OF HUMAN ABUSE POTENTIAL. IN ADDITION, STUDIES WERE UNDERTAKEN TO PROBE THE POTENTIAL FOR ULOTARONT TO BLOCK REINSTATEMENT OF COCAINE-SEEKING BEHAVIOR IN MALE RATS. RESULTS: ULOTARONT WAS NOT SELF-ADMINISTERED BY RATS TRAINED TO SELF-ADMINISTER AMPHETAMINE, COCAINE, OR HEROIN. THE SUBJECTIVE QUALITIES OF ULOTARONT WERE DISTINCT FROM THOSE PRODUCED BY AMPHETAMINE IN A DRUG DISCRIMINATION PROCEDURE. ULOTARONT, AND BUSPIRONE, A NON-SCHEDULED ANXIOLYTIC WITH 5-HT1A AGONISM, PARTIALLY GENERALIZED TO THE INTEROCEPTIVE CUE ELICITED BY 3, 4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE (MDMA). IN ADDITION, ULOTARONT DEMONSTRATED A TREND TO REDUCE COCAINE-PRIMED INDUCED REINSTATEMENT, AND DOSE-DEPENDENTLY REDUCED CUE-REINSTATED RESPONDING. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST ULOTARONT IS NOT LIKELY TO POSE A RISK FOR RECREATIONAL ABUSE IN HUMANS AND MAY HAVE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC UTILITY AS A TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. © 2022 THE AUTHORS",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123590611&doi=10.1016%2fj.drugalcdep.2021.109261&partnerID=40&md5=cb42b27a53d0447d6d61272db9a9ffcb,Netherlands,2022,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.109261,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;COCAINE;CUES;DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP, DRUG;EXTINCTION, PSYCHOLOGICAL;FEMALE;MALE;RATS;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;RECURRENCE;SELF ADMINISTRATION;SEROTONIN 5-HT1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS;AMPHETAMINE;BUSPIRONE;COCAINE;DIAMORPHINE;MIDOMAFETAMINE;SEROTONIN 1A RECEPTOR;ULOTARONT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;SEROTONIN 1 AGONIST;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ARTICLE;CONTROLLED STUDY;DOSE RESPONSE;DRUG DISCRIMINATION TEST;DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING;DRUG SEEKING BEHAVIOR;FEMALE;INTEROCEPTION;MALE;NONHUMAN;OPERANT CONDITIONING;RAT;RELAPSE;RELATIVE HUMIDITY;SELF ADMINISTRATION TEST;TREND STUDY;ANIMAL;ASSOCIATION;DRUG SELF ADMINISTRATION;RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL;RECURRENT DISEASE;REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY)",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85123590611

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST; THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CURRENT STUDY WERE TO CHARACTERIZE THE IN VITRO ADME PROPERTIES, PRECLINICAL PK, AND TO EVALUATE THE DDI POTENTIAL OF ULOTARONT AND ITS MAJOR METABOLITE SEP-383103. METHODS: SOLUBILITY, PERMEABILITY, PLASMA PROTEIN BINDING, CYP INHIBITION AND INDUCTION, TRANSPORTER INHIBITION AND UPTAKE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN VITRO. PHENOTYPING STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED USING RECOMBINANT HUMAN CYPS AND FMOS, HUMAN LIVER MICROSOMES AND HUMAN LIVER HOMOGENATES. PRECLINICAL PLASMA AND BRAIN PHARMACOKINETICS WERE DETERMINED AFTER A SINGLE INTRAPERITONEAL, INTRAVENOUS, AND ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF ULOTARONT. RESULTS: ULOTARONT IS A COMPOUND OF HIGH SOLUBILITY, HIGH PERMEABILITY, AND LOW BINDING TO PLASMA PROTEINS. ULOTARONT METABOLISM IS MEDIATED VIA BOTH NADPH-DEPENDENT AND NADPH-INDEPENDENT PATHWAYS, WITH CYP2D6 AS THE MAJOR METABOLIZING ENZYME. ULOTARONT IS AN INDUCER OF CYP2B6, AND AN INHIBITOR OF CYP2D6, OCT1 AND OCT2, WHILE SEP-383103 IS NEITHER A CYP INDUCER NOR A POTENT INHIBITOR OF CYPS AND HUMAN TRANSPORTERS. ULOTARONT EXHIBITS RAPID ABSORPTION, GREATER THAN 70% BIOAVAILABILITY, APPROXIMATELY 3.5 L/KG VOLUME OF DISTRIBUTION, 1.5-4 H HALF-LIFE, 12-43 ML/MIN/KG CLEARANCE, AND GOOD PENETRATION ACROSS THE BLOOD–BRAIN BARRIER IN PRECLINICAL SPECIES. CONCLUSIONS: ULOTARONT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS A BCS1 COMPOUND BY US FDA. THE ABILITY OF ULOTARONT TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD–BRAIN BARRIER FOR CNS TARGETING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MICE AND RATS.

GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT TAAR1 PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN VARIOUS NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. GIVEN THAT SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONISTS WERE SHOWN TO PRODUCE PRO-COGNITION AND ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE EFFECTS AS WELL AS TO SUPPRESS DRUG USE AND RELAPSE, THEY HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO BE NOVEL TREATMENTS FOR MENTAL DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND ADDICTION. HOWEVER, THE AVERSIVE EFFECTS OF SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONISTS REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. OBJECTIVES: HERE, WE EVALUATED WHETHER THE SELECTIVE TAAR1 FULL AGONIST RO5166017 AND PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397 COULD INDUCE CONDITIONED TASTE AVERSION (CTA). RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT RO5166017 AND RO5263397 PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT AVERSIONS TO BOTH SACCHARIN AND NACL TASTE NOVELTY. FURTHERMORE, RO5166017 PRODUCED CTA TO SACCHARIN IN TAAR1 HETEROZYGOUS KNOCKOUT (TAAR1±) AND WILD-TYPE RATS BUT NOT IN TAAR1 HOMOZYGOUS KNOCKOUT RATS (TAAR1−/−), SUGGESTING THAT TAAR1 WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE TASTE AVERSIVE STIMULUS PROPERTY OF RO5166017. CONCLUSIONS: TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA INDICATE THAT SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONISTS COULD PRODUCE STRONG CTA.

THE QUALITY OF IBS WAS ASSESSED BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF A RATIONALE FOR THE CHOSEN ANIMAL MODEL, COMPLETENESS OF PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) RESULTS IN REPORTING AND INTERNAL VALIDITY INFORMATION OF THE PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE. THE IB-DERISK TOOL WAS USED TO GENERATE PRECLINICAL AND EARLY CLINICAL DATA OVERVIEWS DATA. FOR EACH COMPOUND, THE OVERLAP BETWEEN PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE DOSE RANGES AND WELL-TOLERATED LEVELS WAS CALCULATED FOR THREE PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) PARAMETERS: HUMAN EQUIVALENT DOSE (HED), MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION (CMAX) AND AREA UNDER THE CURVE (AUC).

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

THE CLASSICAL APPROACH TO TREAT SCHIZOPHRENIA IS TO USE TYPICAL AND ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; HOWEVER, LIMITATIONS INCLUDE LOW EFFICACY IN MITIGATING NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTIONS AND A RANGE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS. EVIDENCE HAS ACCUMULATED ON TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR TREATING SCHIZOPHRENIA. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON A TAAR1 AGONIST, ULOTARONT, AS A TREATMENT FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED ON PUBMED/MEDLINE AND OVID DATABASES FOR ENGLISH-PUBLISHED ARTICLES FROM INCEPTION TO 18 DECEMBER 2022. THE LITERATURE FOCUSING ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ULOTARONT AND SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS EVALUATED BASED ON AN INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERION. SELECTED STUDIES WERE ASSESSED FOR THE RISK OF BIAS, USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION TOOL, AND SUMMARIZED IN A TABLE TO GENERATE DISCUSSION TOPICS. RESULTS: THREE CLINICAL, TWO COMPARATIVE, AND FIVE PRECLINICAL STUDIES EXAMINING ULOTARONT’S PHARMACOLOGY, TOLERABILITY AND SAFETY, AND/OR EFFICACY WERE IDENTIFIED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT ULOTARONT HAS A DIFFERING ADVERSE EFFECT PROFILE FROM OTHER ANTIPSYCHOTICS, MAY MITIGATE METABOLIC-RELATED ADVERSE EFFECTS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANTIPSYCHOTICS, AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE PRESENT ULOTARONT AS A POTENTIAL AND PROMISING ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT METHOD FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. DESPITE THIS, OUR RESULTS WERE LIMITED DUE TO THE LACK OF CLINICAL TRIALS ON ULOTARONT’S LONG-TERM EFFICACY AND MECHANISMS OF ACTION.

We characterized the pharmacology of a new series of cathinones, including methedrone, 4-methylethcathinone (4-MEC), 3-fluoromethcathinone (3-FMC), pentylone, ethcathinone, buphedrone, pentedrone, and N,N-dimethylcathinone. We investigated norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5-HT) uptake inhibition using human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells that express the respective human monoamine transporter, the drug-induced efflux of NE, DA, and 5-HT from monoamine-preloaded cells, and binding affinity to monoamine transporters and receptors. All of the cathinones were potent NE uptake inhibitors but differed in their DA vs. 5-HT transporter inhibition profiles and monoamine release effects. Methedrone was a more potent 5-HT than DA transporter inhibitor and released NE and 5-HT similar to para-methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA), para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA), 4-methylthioamphetamine (4-MTA), and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). 4-MEC and pentylone equipotently inhibited all of the monoamine transporters and released 5-HT. Ethcathinone and 3-FMC inhibited NE and DA uptake and released NE, and 3-FMC also released DA similar to N-ethylamphetamine and methamphetamine. Pentedrone and N,N-dimethylcathinone were non-releasing NE and DA uptake inhibitors as previously shown for pyrovalerone cathinones. Buphedrone preferentially inhibited NE and DA uptake and also released NE. None of the cathinones bound to rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1, in contrast to the non-beta-keto-amphetamines. None of the cathinones exhibited relevant binding to other monoamine receptors. In summary, we found considerable differences in the monoamine transporter interaction profiles among different cathinones and compared with related amphetamines.

V and Nimgaonkar, V. L and Deshpande, S. N and Thelma, B K",Schizophrenia Research,Schizophr Res,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic mental illness with behavioral abnormalities. Recent common variant based genome wide association studies and rare variant detection using next generation sequencing approaches have identified numerous variants that confer risk for SZ, but etiology remains unclear propelling continuing investigations. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a rare heterozygous variant (c.545G > T; p.Cys182Phe) in Trace amine associated receptor 1 gene (TAAR1 6q23.2) in three affected members in a small SZ family. The variant predicted to be damaging by 15 prediction tools, causes breakage of a conserved disulfide bond in this G-protein-coupled receptor. On screening this intronless gene for additional variant(s) in ~ 800 sporadic SZ patients, we identified six rare protein altering variants (MAF < 0.001) namely p.Ser47Cys, p.Phe51Leu, p.Tyr294Ter, p.Leu295Ser in four unrelated north Indian cases (n = 475); p.Ala109Thr and p.Val250Ala in two independent Caucasian/African-American patients (n = 310). Five of these variants were also predicted to be damaging. Besides, a rare synonymous variant was observed in SZ patients. These rare variants were absent in north Indian healthy controls (n = 410) but significantly enriched in patients (p = 0.036). Conversely, three common coding SNPs (rs8192621, rs8192620 and rs8192619) and a promoter SNP (rs60266355) tested for association with SZ in the north Indian cohort were not significant (P > 0.05). TAAR1 is a modulator of monoaminergic pathways and interacts with AKT signaling pathways. Substantial animal model based pharmacological and functional data implying its relevance in SZ are also available. However, this is the first report suggestive of the likely contribution of rare variants in this gene to SZ.

Although the presence of TAs in mammalian brain has been recognized for decades, until recently they were considered to be by-products of amino acid metabolism or as ""false"" neurotransmitters. The discovery in 2001 of a new family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), namely trace amines receptors, has re-ignited interest in TAs. In particular, two members of the family, trace amine receptor 1 (TA1) and trace amine receptor 2 (TA2), were shown to be highly sensitive to these endogenous compounds. Experimental evidence suggests that TAs modulate the activity of catecholaminergic neurons and that TA dysregulation may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression and Parkinson's disease, all of which are characterized by altered monoaminergic networks. Here we review recent data concerning the electrophysiological effects of TAs on the activity of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. In the context of recent data obtained with TA1 receptor knockout mice, we also discuss the mechanisms by which the activation of these receptors modulates the activity of these neurons. Three important new aspects of TAs action have recently emerged: (a) inhibition of firing due to increased release of dopamine; (b) reduction of D2 and GABAB receptor-mediated inhibitory responses (excitatory effects due to disinhibition); and (c) a direct TA1 receptor-mediated activation of GIRK channels which produce cell membrane hyperpolarization. While the first two effects have been well documented in our laboratory, the direct activation of GIRK channels by TA1 receptors has been reported by others, but has not been seen in our laboratory (Geracitano et al., 2004). Further research is needed to address this point, and to further characterize the mechanism of action of TAs on dopaminergic neurons.

While success has been made with discovering novel selective agonists for TAAR1, only one TAAR1 antagonist has been described thus far. We used an in silico screen on a TAAR1 homology model and identified several novel agonists and potential antagonists for TAAR1. One of the identified antagonists (compound 22) was predicted to have favourable physicochemical properties that should allow it to cross the blood brain barrier. In vivo studies were therefore carried out and showed that compound 22 potentiates amphetamine- and cocaine-mediated locomotor activity, consistent with behaviours observed in Taar1-KO animals. In order to assess whether the effects of compound 22 are mediated through antagonism of TAAR1, experiments were carried out on Taar1-KO mice. Our results show that compound is also able to enhance amphetamine- and cocaine-mediated locomotor activity in Taar1-KO mice, suggesting that the in vivo effects of compound 22 are not mediated by TAAR1. In collaboration with Psychoactive Drug Screening Program at UNC-Chapel Hill, we attempted to determine the target for compound 22. PDSP results suggested several potential targets for compound 22. These include, the dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin transporters; as well as sigma 1 and 2 receptors. Furthermore, the dopamine D2 receptor was also an initial hit in a functional assay performed by PDSP. Our follow-up studies using heterologous cell systems showed that neither DAT nor dopamine D2 dopamine receptors are targets of compound 22. Therefore, the biological target of compound 22 mediating its psychoactive effects remain unknown.

We review the in vitro, pre-clinical, clinical and molecular imaging evidence on the mode of action of antipsychotics and their side-effects. This identifies the key role of striatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade for clinical response, but also for endocrine and motor side-effects, indicating a therapeutic window for D2 blockade. We consider how partial D2/3 receptor agonists fit within this framework, and the role of off-target effects of antipsychotics, particularly at serotonergic, histaminergic, cholinergic, and adrenergic receptors for efficacy and side-effects such as weight gain, sedation and dysphoria. We review the neurobiology of schizophrenia relevant to the mode of action of antipsychotics, and for the identification of new treatment targets. This shows elevated striatal dopamine synthesis and release capacity in dorsal regions of the striatum underlies the positive symptoms of psychosis and suggests reduced dopamine release in cortical regions contributes to cognitive and negative symptoms. Current drugs act downstream of the major dopamine abnormalities in schizophrenia, and potentially worsen cortical dopamine function. We consider new approaches including targeting dopamine synthesis and storage, autoreceptors, and trace amine receptors, and the cannabinoid, muscarinic, GABAergic and glutamatergic regulation of dopamine neurons, as well as post-synaptic modulation through phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Finally, we consider treatments for cognitive and negative symptoms such dopamine agonists, nicotinic agents and AMPA modulators before discussing immunological approaches which may be disease modifying.

They are predominantly intracellular, located in the central nervous system and peripherally. They have a role in homeostasis and rheostasis, and also in olfaction. They demonstrate significant cross-talk with the monoamine system and are involved in the regulation of cAMP signalling and K+ channels. There is evidence to suggest that TAAR1 may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of schizophrenia, psychosis in Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and the metabolic syndrome and obesity. TAAR1 expression may also be a prognostic biomarker for cancers. A number of TAAR modulators have been identified, including endogenous ligands and new chemical entities. Some of these agents have shown efficacy in animal models of addiction behaviours, depression and anxiety. Only one agent, SEP-363856, has progressed to randomised clinical trials in humans; however further, larger studies with SEP-363856 are required to clarify its suitability as a new treatment for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. SEP-363856 is an agonist of TAAR1 and 5HT1A and it is not clear to what extent its efficacy can be attributed to TAAR1 rather than to other drug targets. However, current research suggests that TAAR1 has an important role in human physiology and pathophysiology. TAAR1 modulators may become an important new drug class for the management of a wide array of mental disorders in the future.

Hedonic and cognitive impairments are transdiagnostic and constitute major burdens in mood disorders. Herein, we systematically review the behavioural and genetic literature documenting the role of TAAR1 in reward and cognitive function, and propose a mechanistic model of TAAR1's functions in the brain. Notably, TAAR1 activity confers antidepressant-like effects, enhances attention and response inhibition, and reduces compulsive reward seeking without impairing normal function. Further characterization of the responsible mechanisms suggests ion-homeostatic, metabolic, neurotrophic, and anti-inflammatory enhancements in the limbic system. Multiple lines of evidence establish the viability of TAAR1 as a biological target for the treatment of mood disorders. Furthermore, the evidence suggests a role for TAAR1 in reward and cognitive function, which is attributed to a cascade of events that are relevant to the cellular integrity and function of the central nervous system.

Full (e.g. RO5256390) and partial (e.g. RO5263397) TAAR1 agonists showed antidepressant-, antipsychotic- and anti-addiction-like behavioral effects in rodents and primates. Acute RO5256390 suppressed, and RO5263397 stimulated serotonin (5-HT) neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in brain slices, suggesting that the behavioral effects of TAAR1 ligands involve 5-HT and dopamine. For more comprehensive testing of this hypothesis, we examined acute and chronic effects of RO5256390 and RO5263397 on monoamine neurons in in vivo conditions. Excitability of 5-HT neurons of the DRN, noradrenaline neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), and dopamine neurons of the VTA was assessed using single-unit electrophysiology in anesthetized rats. For acute experiments, RO5256390 and RO5263397 were administered intravenously; neuronal excitability after RO5256390 and RO5263397 administration was compared to the basal activity of the same neuron. For chronic experiments, RO5256390 was administered orally for fourteen days prior to electrophysiological assessments. The neuronal excitability in RO5256390-treated rats was compared to vehicle-treated controls. We found that acute RO5256390 inhibited 5-HT and dopamine neurons. This effect of RO5256390 was reversed by the subsequent and prevented by the earlier administration of RO5263397. Acute RO5256390 and RO5263397 did not alter the excitability of LC noradrenaline neurons in a statistically significant way. Chronic RO5256390 increased excitability of 5-HT neurons of the DRN and dopamine neurons of the VTA. In conclusion, the putative antidepressant and antipsychotic effects of TAAR1 ligands might be mediated, at least in part, via the modulation of excitability of central 5-HT and dopamine neurons.

3b4e8d12-eed8-4824-975d-0ed644d65e92,Regulation of monoaminergic functions by GPCRS with a special emphasis on mental and movement disorders,Ioannis Mantas,Dissertation Abstracts International,,"Dysfunction of the brain's monoaminergic system has been implicated in many human neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. The monoamines that are most dysregulated in these diseases, are dopamine and serotonin. Monoamines act as signalling molecules through their receptors, which belong predominately to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily1. Most of the clinically employed drugs that are used to tackle these diseases, target directly or indirectly the monoaminergic class of GPCRs. This thesis aims to identify the role of four understudied GPCR-signalling related molecules (GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1) in animal models of PD, MDD and schizophrenia.The main findings relate to the functions of GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1 in relationship to PD, MDD and schizophrenia. GPR88 has been suggested as crucial suppressor of striatal medium spiny neuron activity. We showed that loss of GPR88 facilitates L- dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment for PD by aiding its therapeutic efficacy without worsening its side effects. TAAR1 has been described as negative regulator of dopamine neurons firing rate. Herein, we report that TAAR1 deletion enhances the response of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors but no other classes of antidepressants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the antipsychotic action of the pioneering drug, SEP-856, depends in part on TAAR1 agonism. P11 is a small GPCR-adaptor protein that has been linked to MDD and antidepressant treatment response. In the current thesis, we demonstrate that loss of p11 causes an overt response to stress by triggering the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenomedullary axes. Finally, NURR1 is a GPCR regulated transcription factor, which is linked to PD and schizophrenia as a consequence of its fundamental role in coordinating midbrain dopamine neuron development. In the present work, we describe the role of NURR1 in extra-dopaminergic brain structures such as striatum and claustrum. In detail, we show that induced striatal NURR1 is crucial for locomotor sensitization to L-DOPA. Moreover, we revealed that NURR1 is important factor for claustral neuron transcriptional identity without affecting the occurrence of hallucinogen states' neural correlates.Overall, we explored new avenues in the fields of neurology and psychiatry related molecular neurobiology. These findings may support future drug discovery research on PD, MDD and schizophrenia though the identification of novel pharmaceutical agents to treat these detrimental disorders. Thus, this body of work contributes to the better understanding of both the pharmacology and pathophysiology of mental and movement disorders.

The technical name of the compound studied in this article was incorrectly referred to as SEP-383856 in the title and the abstract and has now been corrected to SEP-363856. None of the scientific conclusions in this paper are affected by this correction. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-02373-001). SEP-383856 (SEP-856) is a novel antipsychotic under clinical development. It displays a unique pattern of receptor interaction, with only weak (partial agonist) activity at dopamine D2 receptors, yet more potent agonist activity at the trace amine associated receptor (TAAR1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor (5-HT1A). Nonetheless, these observations await independent confirmation and more detailed characterization of the in vitro and in vivo actions of SEP-856 at TAAR1 and 5-HT1A receptors would be instructive. Herein, we employed luminescence complementation technology in heterologous live cell systems, confocal microscopy, voltage clamp electrophysiology, behavioral readouts and TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice to study SEP-856 in further detail. We provide evidence for the ability of SEP-856 to activate TAAR1 at the surface plasma membrane, and show that this interaction results in Galphas recruitment (pEC50: 6.08 +/- 0.22 EMAX: 96.41% +/- 15.26) and by extension, to G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel activation. Using TAAR1-KO mice, we find TAAR1 to be indispensable for SEP-856 control of body temperature, baseline locomotion reduction and for ""antipsychotic-like"" efficacy as characterized by a reversal of dizocilipine (MK-801) mediated disruption of pre-pulse inhibition. Conversely, the inhibition by SEP-856 of MK-801 induced locomotion was unaffected in TAAR1 KO mice. SEP-856 behaved as a low-potency, partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, while it partially inhibited recruitment of D2 receptor-coupled Galpha and GIRK by DA and acted as a weak partial agonist with low potency at the same receptor when applied alone. Our findings corroborate and extend previous observations on the molecular substrates engaged by this unique, dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist and potential antipsychotic that could prove to have major advantages in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

Objective: Our objective was to comprehensively characterize the in vitro pharmacology of (S)- and (R)-FCZ to determine its suitability for study of central and peripheral P-]l.beta -adrenergic receptors. Methods: We characterized the in vitro pharmacology of (S)-FCZ at 42 biogenic amine receptors and transporters in vitro using the resources of the National Institute of Mental Health Psychoactive Drug Screening Program. Results: As expected (R)- and (S)-FCZ had high affinities for beta -adrenergic receptors (Ki values=0.08-0.45 nM) and negligible affinities (Ki values > 100 nM) for nearly all other tested receptors and transporters with the exception of the h5-HT1A receptor for which (S)-FCZ had high affinity (Ki=34 nM). Interestingly, (R)-FCZ had low affinity for the h5-HT1A receptor (Ki=342 nM). Conclusion: The high affinity of (S)-FCZ for the h5-HT1A receptor is not likely to interfere with studies of peripheral beta -adrenergic receptors, since 5-HT1A receptors are expressed at very low levels outside the central nervous system. Indeed, computer simulations predict that even at low ligand concentrations, 5-HT1A binding in brain regions like hippocampus are likely to be substantial. Thus, (S)-FCZ may not be a suitable PET ligand for studies of central nervous system beta -adrenergic receptors unless the contribution by 5-HT1A sites can be shown to be negligible.",,,2001,10.1007/s002130100844,article,positron emission tomography;beta-adrenergic;5-HT1A,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000170825600015

Endogenous DMT was investigated in the 1960s and 1970s and it was proposed that DMT was involved in psychosis and schizophrenia. This hypothesis developed from comparisons of the blood and urine of schizophrenic and control subjects. However, much of this research proved inconclusive and conventional thinking has since held that trace levels of DMT, and other endogenous psychoactive tryptamines, are insignificant metabolic byproducts. The recent discovery of a G-protein-coupled, human trace amine receptor has triggered a reappraisal of the role of compounds present in limited concentrations in biological systems. Interestingly enough, DMT and other psychoactive tryptamine hallucinogens elicit a robust response at the trace amine receptor. While it is currently accepted that serotonin 5-HT2A receptors play a pivotal rote in the activity of hallucinogenic/psychedelic compounds, we propose that the effects induced by exogenous DMT administration, especially at Low doses, are due in part to activity at the trace amine receptor. Furthermore, we suggest that endogenous DMT interacts with the TA receptor to produce a calm and relaxed mental state, which may suppress, rather than promote, symptoms of psychosis. This hypothesis may help explain the inconsistency in the early analysis of endogenous DMT in humans. Finally, we propose that amphetamine action at the TA receptor may contribute to the calming effects of amphetamine and related drugs, especially at tow doses.

To investigate the electrophysiological mechanism,by which,beta-PEA induces convulsions, we examined the effect of beta-PEA on ionic currents passing through the cell membrane of dissociated rat cerebral cortical neurons, using a patch-clamp technique. The external application of beta-PEA suppressed ionic currents which continuously flowed when the membrane potential was held at -25 mV The suppression was in a concentration-dependent manner and a half-maximal effective concentration was 540 mu M. These currents suppressed by beta-PEA consisted of two K+ currents: a time- and voltage-dependent K+ current (M-current) and a leakage K+ current. The suppression of the M-current reduces the efficacy of the cur-rent in limiting excessive neuronal firing, and the suppression of the leakage K+ current can cause membrane depolarization and thus promote neuronal excitation.

Concomitant ingestion of these foodstuffs with monoamine oxidase inhibitors may result in the hypertensive crisis known as the ``beer, wine, and cheese effect{'' attributed to their sympathomimetic action. Trace amines have been shown to act on one of a novel group of mammalian seven transmembrane spanning G protein-coupled receptors belonging to the rhodopsin superfamily, cloned in 2001.

A number of drugs, most notably amphetamine and its derivatives, act as agonists at this receptor. This review proposes an official nomenclature designating TAAR1 as the trace amine 1 receptor following the convention of naming receptors after the endogenous agonist, abbreviated to TA(1) where necessary. It goes on to discuss briefly the significance of the receptor, agents acting upon it, its distribution, and currently hypothesized physiological and pathophysiological roles.

TAAR1 is considered a promising drug target for the treatment of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, no selective ligand to identify TAAR1-specific signaling mechanisms is available yet. Here we report a selective TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, and characterize its physiological effects at dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We show that EPPTB prevents the reduction of the firing frequency of DA neurons induced by p-tyramine (p-tyr), a nonselective TAAR1 agonist. When applied alone, EPPTB increases the firing frequency of DA neurons, suggesting that TAAR1 either exhibits constitutive activity or is tonically activated by ambient levels of endogenous agonist(s). We further show that EPPTB blocks the TAAR1-mediated activation of an inwardly rectifying K+ current. When applied alone, EPPTB induces an apparent inward current, suggesting the closure of tonically activated K+ channels. Importantly, these EPPTB effects were absent in Taar1 knockout mice, ruling out off-target effects. We additionally found that both the acute application of EPPTB and the constitutive genetic lack of TAAR1 increase the potency of DA at D2 receptors in DA neurons. In summary, our data support that TAAR1 tonically activates inwardly rectifying K+ channels, which reduces the basal firing frequency of DA neurons in the VTA.

Trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a wide spectrum aminergic receptor that acts as a modulator in brain monoaminergic systems. Other trace amine associated receptors appear to relate to environmental perception and show a birth-and-death pattern in mammals similar to olfactory receptors. Results: Across mammals, avians, and amphibians, the TAAR1 gene is intact and appears to be under strong purifying selection based on rates of amino acid fixation compared to neutral mutations. We have found that in dogs it has become a pseudogene. Our analyses using a comparative genetics approach revealed that the pseudogenization event predated the emergence of the Canini tribe rather than being coincident with canine domestication. By assessing the effects of the TAAR1 agonist beta-phenylethylamine on {[}(3)H] dopamine uptake in canine striatal synaptosomes and comparing the degree and pattern of uptake inhibition to that seen in other mammals, including TAAR1 knockout mice, wild type mice and rhesus monkey, we found that the TAAR1 pseudogenization event resulted in an uncompensated loss of function.

Although these compounds (typified by 2-phenylethylamine, tryptamine and p-tyrarnine) have been established as neurotransmitters in invertebrate species, the available evidence suggests that trace amines do not act as traditional neurotransmitters in mammalian species. Trace amines are released from neurons, but not in an activity dependent manner. Further, administration of exogenous trace amines at doses approaching physiological concentrations, is not associated with changes in neuronal excitability. Rather, at physiological concentrations, trace amines regulate the responsivity of neurons to co-applied neurotransmitters. Since trace amine synthesis appears to be regulated in response to monoamine neurotransmitter receptor activation, it has been proposed that, at least in mammals, trace amines serve a control function, maintaining neuronal responsivity within defined physiological limits. Such a divergence of trace amine functioning between species is also seen in recent genetic studies of trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR). Vertebrate TAAR, although G-protein coupled, appear to have arisen independently of invertebrate TAAR. Further, mammalian TAAR appear to lack glycosylation sites required for membrane insertion. Additional evidence suggests that vertebrate TAAR are rapidly evolving, with a number of species specific variants identified. On this basis it has been suggested that they are involved in species specific adaptive responses. Possibly related to this, sub-types of TAAR have been shown to act as olfactory receptors, being activated in part by urinary amines. Thus, there appear to be significant differences between invertebrates and vertebrates with respect to trace amine functioning. This chapter will review the recent developments in the field of vertebrate trace amine pharmacology, and discuss the evidence for trace amines being the prototype of a new class of endogenous molecule, acting to modulate neural responsivity, rather than directly causing signal transduction.",,,2010,,incollection,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000280379100013

Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated beta-PEA increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced.

This study examined the effects of a selective TAAR 1 agonist, RO5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15 mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. RO5263397 (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with RO5263397 (3.2 and 10 mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity; however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily RO5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32 mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization.

Enzyme studies, using the (then) available commercial uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), suggested that UGT1A4 is responsible for its conjugation. In the first clinical trial, in which RO5263397 was administered orally to healthy human volunteers, a 136-fold above-average systemic exposure to the parent compound was found in one of the participants. Further administration in this trial identified two more such poor metabolizers, all three of African origin. Additional in vitro studies with recombinant UGTs showed that the contribution of UGT2B10 to RO5263397 glucuronidation is much higher than UGT1A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. DNA sequencing in all of these poormetabolizers identified a previously uncharacterized splice site mutation that prevents assembly of full-length UGT2B10 mRNA and thus functional UGT2B10 protein expression. Further DNA database analyses revealed the UGT2B10 splice site mutation to be highly frequent in individuals of African origin (45\\%), moderately frequent in Asians (8\\%) and almost unrepresented in Caucasians (<1\\%). A prospective study using hepatocytes from 20 individual African donors demonstrated a >100-fold lower intrinsic clearance of RO5263397 in cells homozygous for the splice site variant allele. Our results highlight the need to include UGT2B10 when screening the human UGTs for the enzymes involved in the glucuronidation of a new compound, particularly when there is a possibility of N-glucuronidation.

Mice lacking this receptor show a higher sensitivity to dopaminergic stimuli, such as amphetamine; however, it is not clear whether D1 or D2 dopamine receptors and which associated intracellular signaling events are involved in this modulation. In the striatum of TAAR1 knock out (TAAR1-KO mice) we found that D2, but not D1, dopamine receptors were over-expressed, both in terms of mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, the D2 dopamine receptor-related G protein-independent AKT/GSK3 signaling pathway was selectively activated, as indicated by the decrease of phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3 beta. The decrease in phospho-AKT levels, suggesting an increase in D2 dopamine receptor activity in basal conditions, was associated with an increase of AKT/PP2A complex, as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Finally, we found that the locomotor activation induced by the D2 dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole, but not by the full D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF-82958, was increased in TAAR1-KO mice. These data demonstrate pronounced supersensitivity of postsynaptic D2 dopamine receptors in the striatum of TAAR1-KO mice and indicate that a close interaction of TAAR1 and D2 dopamine receptors at the level of postsynaptic structures has important functional consequences.

Because rare, loss-of-function mutations in the DDC gene result in severe enzymatic deficiency and devastating autonomic, motor, and cognitive impairment, DDC common genetic polymorphisms have been proposed as a source of more moderate, but clinically important, alterations in DDC function that may contribute to risk, course, or treatment response in complex, heritable neuropsychiatric illnesses. However, a direct link between common genetic variation in DDC and DDC activity in the living human brain has never been established. We therefore tested for this association by conducting extensive genotyping across the DDC gene in a large cohort of 120 healthy individuals, for whom DDC activity was then quantified with {[}F-18]-FDOPA positron emission tomography (PET). The specific uptake constant, K-i, a measure of DDC activity, was estimated for striatal regions of interest and found to be predicted by one of five tested haplotypes, particularly in the ventral striatum.

EEG, EMG, body temperature (Tb), and locomotor activity (LMA) were recorded in Taar1 KO, OE, and WT mice.

In another experiment, mice were given three doses of the TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397, caffeine, or vehicle p. o. Baseline wakefulness was modestly increased in OE compared with WT mice. Baseline theta (4.5-9 Hz) and low gamma (30-60 Hz) activity was elevated in KO compared with OE mice in NREM and REM sleep. Following SD, both KO and OE mice exhibited a homeostatic sleep rebound. In WT mice, RO5263397 increased waking and reduced NREM and REM sleep, decreased gamma power during wake and NREM, and decreased Tb without affecting LMA; these effects were absent in KO mice and potentiated in OE mice. In contrast, caffeine increased wake time, NREM gamma power, and LMA in all strains compared with vehicle; this effect was attenuated in KO and potentiated in OE mice.

The simplest phenylethylamine, 2-phenylethylamine itself, is without significant central action when administered at moderate doses, but fairly simple structural modifications profoundly impact its pharmacology and result in large numbers of useful pharmacological tools, agents with therapeutic potential, and in drugs of abuse (e.g., hallucinogens, central stimulants, empathogens), the latter of which are the primary focus here. In vivo drug discrimination techniques and in vitro receptor/transporter methods have been applied to understand the actions of these phenylalkylamines and their mechanisms of action.

Existing molecular evidence indicates that TAAR1 regulates dopamine levels through interactions with dopamine transporters and D2 receptors. However, investigations to date have not been exhaustive and other pathways may be involved. In this study, we used a well-described set of behaviors, quinpirole-induced yawning and hypothermia, to explore the potential interaction of TAAR1 and D3 receptors, which are members of the `D2-like' dopamine receptor subfamily. Previous studies have shown that for D2/D3 receptor agonists, the induction of yawning is a D3 receptor-mediated effect, whereas the inhibition of yawning and induction of hypothermia are D2 receptor-mediated effects. Quinpirole produced an inverted U-shaped dose-effect curve for yawning, which was shifted downward dose-dependently by each of the TAAR1 agonists RO5263397 and RO5166017. Quinpirole also produced dose-dependent hypothermia which was not affected by either TAAR1 agonist. These results suggest that TAAR1 agonists may interact with D3 receptors and/or its downstream pathways, as opposed to D2 receptors.

However, the subcellular distribution of TAAR1 is still unclear, since TAAR1 signal is largely intracellular. In vitro, TAAR1 is activated with nanomolar to micromolar affinity by some endogenous amines, particularly p-tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), the latter representing a novel branch of thyroid hormone signaling. In addition, TAAR1 responds to a number of psychoactive drugs, i.e., amphetamines, ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and lisuride. Trace amines have been identified as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, and they are considered as potential neuromodulators. In particular, beta-phenylethylamine and p-tyramine have been reported to modify the release and/or the response to dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine and GABA, while evidence of cross-talk between TAAR1 and other aminergic receptors has been provided. Systemic or intracerebroventricular injection of exogenous T1AM produced prolearning and antiamnestic effects, reduced pain threshold, decreased non-REM sleep, and modulated the firing rate of adrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus. However each of these substances may have additional molecular targets, and it is unclear whether their endogenous levels are sufficient to produce significant TAAR1 activation in vivo. TAAR1 knock out mice show a worse performance in anxiety and working memory tests, and they are more prone to develop ethanol addiction. They also show increased locomotor response to amphetamine, and decreased stereotypical responses induced by apomorphine. Notably, human genes for TAARs cluster on chromosome 6 at q23, within a region whose mutations have been reported to confer susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. For human TAAR1, around 200 non-synonymous and 400 synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified, but their functional consequences have not been extensively investigated yet. In conclusion, the bulk of evidence points to a significant physiological role of TAAR1 in the modulation of central nervous system function and a potential pharmacological role of TAAR1 agonists in neurology and/or psychiatry. However, the specific effects of TAAR1 stimulation are still controversial, and many crucial issues require further investigation.",,,2018,10.3389/fphar.2017.00987,article,TAAR1;T1AM;dopamine;neurotransmitter hormone;trace amines,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000419700000003

In conclusion, the tested 2C-BI derivatives displayed diverse pharmacological profiles. The relatively high affinities of various 2C-BI derivatives at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor indicate a high steric tolerance of the binding pocket. Potent partial activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor by 2C-BI-8 and 2C-BI-12 suggests that these substances may potentially exert psychedelic effects similar to other compounds of the 2C family.",,,2019,10.1016/j.ejphar.2019.05.014,article,Phenethylamine;Serotonin;2C-BI;Biscaline;Receptor;Transporter,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000468869300012

Several types of trace amine receptors have been identified. Trace amine-associated receptor 1 is localized in the prefrontal cortex and limbic structures. Localization of the other types of receptors is different. In particular, trace amine-associated receptor 5 is localized in the olfactory epithelium and structures of the olfactory brain. By interaction with dopaminergic and other neurotransmitter systems of the CNS, trace amines are involved in the regulation of many behavioral forms.

Unlike typical antipsychotics, which are effective only against positive symptoms of schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics are effective against negative and cognitive symptoms as well. Furthermore, they are effective not only in psychotic but also in affective disorders, on their own or as adjuncts to antidepressant drugs. This review presents the neural mechanisms of currently existing atypical antipsychotics and putative antipsychotics currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies and how these relate to their effectiveness in mood disorders such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Typical antipsychotics act almost exclusively on the dopamine system. Atypical drugs, however, modulate serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine, and/or histamine neurotransmission as well. This multimodal mechanism of action putatively underlies the beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotics in mood and anxiety disorders. Interestingly, novel experimental drugs having dual antipsychotic and antidepressant therapeutic potential, such as histamine, adenosine, and trace amine-associated receptors (TAAR) ligand, are also characterized by a multimodal stimulatory effect on central 5-HT, norepinephrine, and/or histamine transmission. The multimodal stimulatory effect on central monoamine neurotransmission may be thus primarily responsible for the combined antidepressant and antipsychotic therapeutic potential of certain central nervous system (CNS) drugs.",,,2020,10.3390/ijms21249532,article,serotonin;norepinephrine;dopamine;histamine;adenosine;trace amines;atypical antipsychotics;mechanism of action;receptor pharmacology,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,WOS:000602928300001

Although SEP-363856 activates TAAR1 and 5-HT1A receptors in vitro, an accessible marker of time- and concentration-dependent effects of SEP-363856 in humans is lacking. In rodents, SEP-363856 has been shown to suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The aim of the current study was to translate the REM sleep effects to humans and determine pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of SEP-363856 on a measure of brain activity. The effects of SEP-363856 were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-way crossover study of single oral doses (50 and 10mg) on REM sleep in healthy male subjects (N=12 at each dose level). Drug concentrations were sampled during sleep to interpolate individual subject's pharmacokinetic trajectories. SEP-363856 suppressed REM sleep parameters with very large effect sizes (>3) following single doses of 50mg and plasma concentrations >= 100ng/mL. Below that effective concentration, the 10mg dose elicited much smaller effects, increasing only the latency to REM sleep (effect size = 1). The PK/PD relationships demonstrated that REM sleep probability increased as drug concentrations declined below 100ng/mL over the course of the night.

However, after years from their identification, the physio-pathological meaning of T1AM and TA1 tissue levels remains an unsolved issue while pharmacological evidence indicates both compounds promote in rodents central and peripheral effects with mechanisms which remain mostly elusive. Pharmacodynamics of T1AM includes the recognition of G-coupled receptors, ion channels but also biotransformation into an active metabolite, i.e. the TA1. Furthermore, long term T1AM treatment associates with post-translational modifications of cell proteins. Such array of signaling may represent an added value, rather than a limit, equipping T1AM to play different functions depending on local expression of targets and enzymes involved in its biotransformation. Up to date, no information regarding TA1 mechanistic is available.

Herein, several pharmacologically uninvestigated scalines and 3C-scalines were examined at key monoamine targets in vitro. Binding affinity at human serotonergic 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C, adrenergic alpha(1A) and alpha(2A), and dopaminergic D-2 receptors, rat and mouse trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), and human monoamine transporters were assessed using target specific transfected cells.

We examined the key pharmacological mechanisms including monoamine uptake inhibition and release using human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with the respective human transporters. Additionally, we assessed monoamine transporter and receptor binding and activation properties. MDA, its fluorinated analogs, as well as the alpha-ethyl containing BDB and the dimeric amphetamine DPIA inhibited NET with the greatest potency and preferentially inhibited 5-HT vs. dopamine uptake. The beta-methoxy MDA analog 3C-BOH and the amphetamine-based N,alpha-DEPEA inhibited NET and preferentially inhibited dopamine vs. 5-HT uptake. The test drugs mediated efflux of at least one monoamine with the exception of DPIA. Most compounds bound to 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors (Ki <= 10 mu M) and several substances activated the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor as partial or full agonists. Furthermore, several compounds interacted with adrenergic receptors and the trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) in the micromolar range.

Psychotropic drugs are commonly prescribed to manage mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, but unfortunately, they can cause significant and undesirable side effects, such as myocarditis, erectile dysfunction, and obesity. Furthermore, some schizophrenic patients may not respond to psychotropic drugs, a condition called schizophrenia-treatment resistance. Fortunately, clozapine is a promising option for patients who exhibit treatment resistance. Unlike chlorpromazine, scientists have found that clozapine has fewer neurological side effects. Additionally, olanzapine and aripiprazole are well-known for their moderating effects on psychosis and are widely used in clinical practice. To further maximize drug efficacy, it is critical to deeply understand the receptors or signaling pathways central to the nervous system, such as serotonin, histamine, trace amines, dopamine, and G-protein coupled receptors. This article provides an overview of the receptors mentioned above, as well as the antipsychotics that interact with them, such as olanzapine, aripiprazole, clozapine, and chlorpromazine.

Ulotaront was discovered through a unique, target-agnostic approach optimized to identify drug candidates lacking D2 and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism, while demonstrating an antipsychotic-like phenotypic profile in vivo. The mechanism of action (MOA) of ulotaront is thought to be mediated by agonism at TAAR1 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Ulotaront has completed two Phase 2 trials (4-week acute study and 26-week open-label extension) which led to Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of schizophrenia. In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, acute study, ulotaront was associated with significant (p < 0.001) improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score (effect size {[}ES]: 0.45), with improvements vs. placebo also observed across secondary endpoints. Post-hoc analyses of the acute trial revealed additional evidence to support the effect of ulotaront on negative symptoms. In the 4-week study, ulotaront was well-tolerated, with an incidence of adverse events (AEs) numerically lower compared to placebo (45.8\\% vs. 50.4\\%; with a number needed to harm {[}NNH] for individual ulotaront AEs all > 40). The open-label extension demonstrated further improvement across schizophrenia symptoms and confirmed the tolerability of ulotaront, with a 6-month completion rate of 67\\%.

Previous studies demonstrated ulotaront suppresses rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in both rodents and healthy vol-unteers. We assessed acute and sustained treatments of ulotaront on REM sleep and symptoms of cat-aplexy and alertness in subjects with narcolepsy-cataplexy.Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 3-way crossover study, ulo-taront was evaluated in 16 adults with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Two oral doses of ulotaront (25 mg and 50 mg) were administered daily for 2 weeks and compared with matching placebo (6-treatment sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment). Results: Acute treatment with both 25 mg and 50 mg of ulotaront reduced minutes spent in nighttime REM compared to placebo. A sustained 2-week administration of both doses of ulotaront reduced the mean number of short-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) during daytime multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) compared to placebo. Although cataplexy events decreased from the overall mean baseline during the 2-week treatment period, neither dose of ulotaront statistically separated from placebo (p = 0.76, 25 mg; p = 0.82, 50 mg), and no significant improvement in patient and clinician measures of sleepiness from baseline to end of the 2-week treatment period occurred in any treatment group.Conclusions: Acute and sustained treatment with ulotaront reduced nighttime REM duration and day-time SOREMPs, respectively. The effect of ulotaront on suppression of REM did not demonstrate a sta-tistical or clinically meaningful effect in narcolepsy-cataplexy.

Therefore it was interesting to look for a noninvasive biochemical indicator of parasympathetic activity. A parasympaticomimetic syndrome associated with muscarinic receptor stimulation, which has been followed during 48 h, was obtained in the awake rat by reserpine injection (6.25 mg/kg at T0 and T24h), and a model of prolonged parasympatholytic syndrome, by administration of diphemanil-methylsulfate (DPMS), a muscarinic receptor inhibitor, in drinking water (mean daily dosis: 150 mg/kg). Significant bradycardia and tachycardia were respectively observed. In the reserpine-treated rats we found significantly increased cyclic guanosylmonophosphate (cGMP) urinary excretion between T24h and T48h, when compared with vehicle-treated controls (+87% in one experiment, +135% in the other, when expressed in pmol/microg creatinine); norepinephrine urinary excretion between T24h and T48h was decreased (-44%); the increase in cGMP urinary excretion was not significantly modified by the NO-synthase inhibitor, L-nitroarginine-methyl-ester. In the DPMS-treated rats, we observed a significantly decreased cGMP (-20%) and increased norepinephrine urinary excretion (+61%). Thus cGMP excretion varied in opposite directions in the reserpine- and DPMS-treated rats. The link between these modifications in cGMP excretion and muscarinic receptor stimulation or blockade has still to be fully demonstrated. Urinary cGMP excretion could be tested as screening parameter in infants at risk of faint episodes associated with bradycardia.",,Netherlands,1999,10.1016/s0024-3205(98)00541-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10069489

S(-)-UH-301 (2.0-32.0 micromol kg(-1)), but not WAY-100,635 (0.08-1.2 micromol kg(-1)), produced a decreased 5-HTP accumulation in the neostriatum and in the hippocampus.

Either [125I]NCQ298 (Kd = 19 pM), or [25I]iodolisuride (Kd = 0.27 nM) or [3H]raclopride (Kd = 1.5 nM) were administered intravenously (IV) to animals 1 h after the intraperitoneal (IP) injection of either alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) (250 mg/kg) or nomifensine (15 mg/kg), or saline. The kinetics of radioactivity concentration in the striatum, cerebellum, and plasma were measured for up to 4 h after [125I]NCQ298 or [125I]iodolisuride injection and up to 1.5 h after [3H]raclopride injection. For each tracer, the striatum-to-cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratios (S/C) and the binding potential (BP), calculated as the association to dissociation binding rate constant ratios (k3/k4), were assessed and related to the changes in extracellular dopamine concentration induced by drug treatments. Results show that S/C and BP of [3H]raclopride were significantly diminished by pretreatment with nomifensine, a drug that increases extracellular dopamine concentration. Nomifensine pretreatment induced no changes in the in vivo binding indexes of the high affinity [125I]NCQ298 and a slight but not significant decrease of the binding indexes of 125I]iodolisuride. Treatment with AMPT, which induced a 40% reduction in dopamine concentration, did not change [125I]NCQ298 binding indexes but slightly increased those of [3H]raclopride and [125I]iodolisuride. In conclusion, the change of dopamine concentration induces modification of radiotracer kinetics. Thus, the combined use of tracers with high and low affinities could allow us to obtain information both on receptor density and neurotransmitter release in vivo.

It has been hypothesized that prefrontal cortical pathology might induce both diminished steady-state and exaggerated responses of dopaminergic neurons to certain stimuli (e.g., stress). We examined the relationship between a measure of prefrontal neuronal pathology and striatal dopamine activity in patients with schizophrenia and in a nonhuman primate model of abnormal prefrontal cortical development. METHODS: In the patients, we studied in vivo markers of cortical neuronal pathology with NMR spectroscopic imaging and of steady-state striatal dopamine activity with radioreceptor imaging. In the monkeys, we used the same NMR technique and in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Measures of N-acetyl-aspartate concentrations (NAA) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex strongly and selectively predicted D2 receptor availability in the striatum (n = 14, rho = -.64, p < .01), suggesting that the greater the apparent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex pathology, the less the steady-state dopamine activity in these patients. A similar relationship between NAA measures in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and steady-state dopamine concentrations in the striatum was found in the monkeys (n = 5, rho = .70, p < .05). We then tested in the same monkeys the relationship of prefrontal NAA and striatal dopamine overflow following amphetamine infusion into dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Under these conditions, the relationship was inverted, i.e., the greater the apparent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex pathology, the greater the dopamine release. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate direct relationships between putative neuronal pathology in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatal dopamine activity in human and nonhuman primates and implicate a mechanism for dopamine dysregulation in schizophrenia.",,United States,1999,10.1016/s0006-3223(98)00380-1,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10187995

Our results revealed that nerve terminals are able to take up and release dopamine upon axonal stimulation. Since dopamine is thought to protect the afferent nerve fibres from damage due to acoustic trauma or ischaemia, enhancement of the release of dopamine, a potential therapeutic site of these injuries, was investigated. Positive modulation of dopamine release has been shown by a D1 dopamine receptor agonist, an antagonist and piribedil. Furthermore, negative feedback on the stimulation-evoked release of dopamine via D2 dopamine receptors has been excluded. Electrical stimulation of the cochlear tissue produced a significant and reproducible release of [3H]dopamine, which could be blocked by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and cadmium (100 microM), proving that axonal activity releases dopamine and its dependence on Ca2+ influx verifies its neuronal origin. Nomifensine, a high-affinity dopamine uptake blocker, prevented the tissue from taking up [3H]dopamine from the bathing solution, also indicating the neural origin of dopamine released in response to stimulation. SKF-38393 (a selective D1 agonist) increased both the resting and electrically evoked release of dopamine. Piribedil (a D3/D2/D1 agonist), a drug under investigation, known to prevent acoustic trauma or ischaemia-induced hearing loss, had a similar and concentration-dependent increasing effect on both resting and evoked release of dopamine. The effect of both drugs on stimulation-evoked release could be prevented by SKF-83566 (a selective D1 antagonist). However, SKF-83566 alone enhanced the resting and axonal conduction-associated release of dopamine. D2 agonists and antagonists failed to modulate the release of dopamine, indicating the lack of negative feedback modulation of dopamine release. Our results suggest that the release of dopamine was subjected to modulation by a D1 receptor agonist and an antagonist. In addition, it is concluded that D2 receptors are not involved in the modulation of dopamine release. This observation may have clinical relevance in the prevention or therapy of particular types of hearing loss, because enhanced dopaminergic input into the primary auditory neuron may inhibit the (over)excitation of this neuron by glutamatergic input from inner hair cells.",,United States,1999,10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00461-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10188940

The low TRP diet caused significant reductions in both plasma total TRP and brain cortical 5-HT content together with a significant increase in the PRL responses to mCPP. In contrast the PRL responses to 8-OH-DPAT in animals on the low TRP diet for 1 week and 6 weeks were similar to control rats. However, a small but significant increase in PRL was observed at 2 min after dosing in the 1-week group. At the same time the 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding parameters, Kd and Bmax, were similar in both control and TRP depleted animals. The results confirm that long-term TRP depletion causes a deficiency of brain TRP and a subsequent reduction of brain 5-HT. This is associated with an enhanced PRL response to mCPP probably resulting from a functional up-regulation of post-synaptic 5-HT2C receptors.

The classical neuroleptic haloperidol was used as reference compound. Two hyperdopaminergia and two hypoglutamatergia mouse models were used. Hyperdopaminergia was produced by the DA releaser d-amphetamine or the DA uptake inhibitor GBR 12909. Hypoglutamatergia was produced by the un-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 or the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist D-CPPene. M100907 was found to counteract the locomotor stimulant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and D-CPPene, but spontaneous locomotion, d-amphetamine- and GBR-12909-induced hyperactivity were not significantly affected. Haloperidol, on the other hand, antagonized both NMDA antagonist- and DA agonist-induced hyperactivity, as well as spontaneous locomotion in the highest dose used. Based on the present and previous results we draw the conclusion that 5-HT2A receptor antagonists are particularly effective against behavioural anomalies resulting from hypoglutamatergia of various origins. The clinical implications of our results and conclusions would be that a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, due to i a the low side effect liability, could be the preferable treatment strategy in various disorders associated with hypoglutamatergia; such conditions might include schizophrenia, childhood autism and dementia disorders.",,Austria,1999,10.1007/s007020050144,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10226932

Short communication.,Inoue O and Wakahara S and Kobayashi K and Gee A ,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",,"The effect of acute pretreatment with MK-801 on the binding in vivo of both 3H-N-methylspiperone (NMSP) and 3H-raclopride (RAC) were compared in mice. In the striatum, MK-801 significantly increase 3H-NMSP binding, whereas no significant alterations in 3H-RAC binding were seen. In contrast, binding in the cerebral cortex of both radiolabeled ligands was not changed by MK-801. Kinetic analysis revealed that the increase in 3H-NMSP binding induced by MK-801 was due to an increase in the rate constant k3(k3 = kon.Bmax). In vivo saturation experiments showed that Bmax for 3H-NMSP binding was relatively unchanged and an increase in the apparent association rate constant (kon) was the main reason for an increase in the k3 for 3H-NMSP binding. As 3H-RAC binding is known to be much more sensitive to competitive inhibition than is 3H-NMSP binding, these results strongly suggest that factors other than competition by endogenous dopamine may contribute to changes in receptor binding in vivo caused by NMDA-antagonism.",,Austria,1999,10.1007/s007020050145,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10226933

Segraves (1995) has proposed that the inhibition of noradrenergic transmission by serotonin may be the mechanism which causes the antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunctions.

Rats received MA or the vehicle according to the repeated escalating dose schedule (1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5 mg/kg s.c x2/every other day for a week). After a 5 day drug abstinent period, the rats were exposed to conditioned fear stress (CFS; exposure to an environment paired previously with footshock). Repeated but not single MA pretreatment significantly increased conditioned freezing behavior, suggesting that rats previously exposed to chronic MA are hypersensitive to subsequent stress than control rats. Repeated MA treatment did not decrease basal dopamine concentrations in the brain. Furthermore, repeated co-administration of MK-801 (non-competitive NMDA antagonist), amfonelic acid (dopamine reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (serotonin reuptake inhibitor) with MA did not alter the enhanced freezing behavior. Taken together, it seems that MA-induced hypersensitivity to stress is not due to the neurotoxic effect of MA. While co-administration of SCH23390 (D1/5 antagonist) or raclopride (D2/3 antagonist) had no effect on the MA-induced increase in freezing, co-administration of nemonapride (D2/3/4 antagonist) prevented this increase. These results suggest that MA-induced enhancement of anxiety might be mediated by D4 receptors. The homovanilic acid (HVA) levels in the striatum were elevated by footshock in MA-treated rats but not in saline-treated rats. Furthermore, MA-treated rats showed increased metabolism of dopamine (DA) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), even when placed in the shock chamber without shocks. The HVA levels in the striatum in MA-treated rats were more elevated by CFS than these in saline-treated rats. These results suggest that the striatum DA system, as well as the mPFC DA system suggested previously, may be associated with emotional hypersensitivity to stress following repeated MA treatment.",,Japan,1999,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10331059

It was confirmed that a substantial portion (8--20%) of the radioactivity taken up and retained by the heart could not be extracted with perchloric acid, in all probability representing covalently bound oxidation products of 6-OH-DA to tissue proteins. Pharmacological analysis showed that a large part of this fraction was associated with the adrenergic nerves. The time-course of the perchloric acid resistant binding to the adrenergic nerves was found to parallel that of the neurotoxic action of 6-hydroxydopamine as evaluated by monitoring the change in [3H]noradrenaline uptake. Calculation of the intranelronal 6-hydroxydopamine concentration (average) needed to induce degeneration showed it to be in the order of 50 mM. The binding ratio for tritium deriving from [3H]6-OH-DA between the intraneuronal and extraneuronal compartments was found to be 10,000 to 30,000, pointing to a very high neuronal specificity for 6-hydroxydopamine. The 'covalent' binding of oxidation products of [3H]6-OH-DA was considerably reduced after desipramine or 1-phenyl-3(2-thiazolyl)-2-thiourea administration, treatments both known to protect the adrenergic nerves from undergoing degeneration. Conversely it was found that the binding increased during conditions known to potentiate the neurotoxic action of 6-hydroxydopamine, e.g., after monoamine oxidase inhibition with nialamide. Subcellular fractionation studies indicated that the predominant site of interaction between 6-hydroxydopamine oxidation products and neuronal proteins is the cytoplasm and the axonal membrane. Analysis of the effect in vivo administration of 6-hydroxydopamine on the field-stimulated induced release of [3H]noradrenaline previously taken up in the adrenergic nerves showed a 6-hydroxydopamine indiced reduction in [3H]noradrenaline release which was approximately proportional to the reduction in the number of nerve terminals. These findings further support the view that 6-hydroxydopamine acts largely in an ""all-or-none' fashion with respect to the neurodegenerative action. Administration of [3H]dopamine also resulted in a fraction which was not extractable with perchloric acid, although this fraction was very small compared to that found after an equal dose of [3H]6-hydroxydopamine. These data may indicate that oxidation products of dopamine can interact with tissue proteins. From the present results it can be concluded that there is a close relationship between 'covalent' binding of 6-hydroxydopamine oxidation products to neuronal elements and the cytotoxic action of 6-hydroxydopamine, indicating that this binding may play an important role in the neurodegenerative action of 6-hydroxydopamine on catecholamine neurons.",,Finland,1976,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1034180

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the putative anxiolytic, R(+) HA-966, applied locally at the level of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), on the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear. METHODS: Ten to 14 days after cannula implantation, rats were subjected to the acquisition session (10x5 s tone paired with 0.5 s, 0.8 mA footshock) followed about 24 h later by the expression session (ten tones only) of a conditioned fear protocol. Rats were treated with R(+) HA-966 (15 microg/VTA) or saline before either the acquisition or expression sessions. Other rats were injected with saline or R(+) HA-966 (10 microg/side), intra-medial prefrontal cortex, on the expression day. RESULTS: R(+)HA-966, intra-VTA, prevented stress-induced changes in mesoprefrontal, but not mesoaccumbal, dopamine metabolism and was associated with a reduction in fearful responses to physical (footshock) and psychological (conditioned fear) stressors. Additionally, rats treated with R(+)HA-966 intra-VTA before the acquisition session were less fearful at the beginning of the expression session. Local injection of R(+)HA-966 into medial prefrontal cortex did not have anxiolytic-like behavioral or biochemical actions but diminished the expression of exploratory behavior in non-stress, control rats.

Beta,gamma-Methylene-L-ATP (beta,gamma-mATP; 1.0 to 1.5 microM, n = 8), NE (0.1 microM, n = 8), and NPY (0.1 microM, n = 14) increased perfusion pressure by maximally 12 +/- 1, 17 +/- 2, and 9 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively. In the presence of NPY, responses to ATP and NE were dramatically enhanced. Renal nerve stimulation in the presence of the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 microM) induced pressor responses of 54 +/- 5 mmHg (n = 6). Alpha-blockade-resistant responses were abolished by the P2-purinoceptor blocker suramin (300 microM) and thus mediated by ATP. Purinergic responses were also reduced significantly (50%) by the NPY-Y1 receptor blocker BIBP 3226 (1 microM). NPY (0.1 microM) potentiated purinergic pressor responses and enhanced ATP release from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 4.1 +/- 0.9 pmol (n = 4) associated with a significant increase of soluble ATPase activity. All NPY effects were prevented by BIBP 3226. Pressor responses to renal nerve stimulation delivered at short time intervals, mimicking enhanced sympathetic drive to the kidney, were not constant but showed a progressive rise, which was prevented by BIBP 3226. In this study, it is suggested that purinergic vasoconstriction in rat kidney depends on concomitantly released NPY.

Using whole-cell recording and rat cerebellar slices, we have examined whether mammalian monoamine-containing neurons play analogous roles in synaptic plasticity, and our results suggest that serotonin and noradrenaline are critically involved in short- and long-term modulation of GABAergic transmission in the cerebellar cortex. Exogenously applied serotonin and noradrenaline selectively induced a short-term enhancement of GABAergic transmission between cerebellar interneurons and Purkinje cells, their effect subsiding in 30 min. Successive amine applications converted this effect to long-term facilitation lasting more than 2 h. During the monoamine-induced short- and long-term facilitation, spontaneously occurring miniature inhibitory synaptic responses increased in frequency, without significant changes in their mean amplitude and amplitude distribution, as well as the GABA receptor sensitivity of Purkinje cells. The actions of the two amines on the inhibitory transmission were mimicked by forskolin and blocked by kinase inhibitors, H-7, H-89 and Rp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate. Thus, serotonin and noradrenaline are likely to activate cyclic-AMP- and protein kinase-dependent pathways in GABAergic interneurons, thereby reinforcing the inhibitory transmission on to Purkinje cells. Repetitive electrical stimulation within the molecular layer mimicked the facilitatory effect induced by exogenous monoamines: namely, neural stimulation selectively elicited long-lasting enhancement of GABAergic transmission in a manner sensitive to the monoamine receptor antagonists, methiothepin and propranolol, and an uptake inhibitor, imipramine. Synaptically released monoamines thus appear to induce cyclic-AMP- and protein kinase-dependent long-term facilitation of cerebellar GABAergic transmission, thereby providing a likely mechanism of synaptic plasticity associated with motor coordination within the mammalian cerebellar system.",,United States,1999,10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00260-7,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10363824

In the present study, a cDNA pool was prepared from poly A + RNA isolated from pharynxes dissected from the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, and was used as a template for RT-PCR with degenerate primers designed from sequences conserved in 5-HT receptors from a variety of sources. A putative 5-HT receptor cDNA (AS1) was identified which exhibited most identity to the 5-HT2 family of receptors. AS1 was 1925 nucleotides, did not appear to be trans-spliced and contained a 3' untranslated region of 127 nucleotides with a polyadenylation signal (ATTAAA) and a short poly A+ tail. The coding region predicted a protein of 532 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60 176. When AS1 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, isolated membranes exhibited the high affinity, saturable binding of [125I]LSD. More importantly, [125I]LSD binding was inhibited by 5-HT, but not other biogenic amines, supporting the identification of AS1 as a 5-HT receptor. Additional cDNAs identical, in part, to AS1 were also identified. AS1deltaIV lacked a predicted 42 amino acids at the carboxy terminus of the third intracellular loop, while AS2 and AS3 contained different COOH-termini, regions implicated in G-protein coupling in other heptahelical receptors. A portion of the gene (5htn) encoding AS1 also was cloned and sequenced. This genomic fragment was about 10 kb, contained the entire AS1 open reading frame and included eight exons and seven introns. From this analysis, it appears that these different AS cDNAs were generated by alternative-splicing, AS1deltaIV from the deletion of exon IV, and AS2 and AS3 from the use of alternative sites within exon VII as 5' splice acceptor sites for exon VIII. Using RT-PCR and primers specific for each of the isoforms, AS1 -3 appeared to be expressed in pharynx, while only AS1 and AS2 were present in body wall muscle.

The 5-HT1B knockout mice show evidence of increased aggression and impulsivity, behavioral patterns that are also associated with reduced 5-HT function. They also show reduced or absent locomotor stimulation to some serotoninergic drugs, indicating that the locomotor effects of these drugs require the 5-HT1B receptor.

The 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice show a phenotype of increased vulnerability to drugs of abuse such as cocaine. However, pharmacological studies suggest that 5-HT1B stimulation enhances the effects of cocaine, while 5-HT1B blockade can attenuate some of the effects of cocaine. Compensations that enhance dopamine function appear to be responsible for the drug-vulnerable phenotype of 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice. By studying these compensations and changes in neural function, we can learn more about the fundamental mechanisms underlying addiction.

(-)-Pindolol potentiated the increase in FCX levels of 5-HT elicited by the 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, fluoxetine and duloxetine, and also enhanced their ability to elevate FCX levels of DA--though not of NAD. In contrast to (-)-pindolol, betaxolol and ICI118,551 did not affect the actions of fluoxetine, whereas both WAY100,635 and SB224,289 potentiated the increase in levels of 5-HT--but not DA or NAD levels--elicited by fluoxetine. In conclusion, (-)-pindolol modulates, both alone and together with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic transmission in the FCX via a complex pattern of actions at beta 1/2-ARs, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT1B receptors. These findings have important implications for clinical studies of the influence of (-)-pindolol upon the actions of antidepressant agents.",,England,1999,10.1016/S0893-133X(99)00035-4,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10432475

The two drugs have overlapping discriminative effects. Enhancement of dopamine-mediated neurotransmission appears to contribute to the behavioral effects of caffeine. This study was conducted to determine if there is a dopamine component to the discriminative effects of CGS 15943. Squirrel monkeys discriminating between i.m. injections of 1.0 mg/kg CGS 15943 and vehicle generalized dose-dependently and completely to eight dopamine receptor agonists that encompass a variety of mechanisms and sites of action, both pre- and postsynaptic. The discriminative effects of the training dose of CGS 15943 were blocked dose-dependently and completely by the dopamine receptor antagonists R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaz epine (SCH 23390; D1) and eticlopride (D2). Thus, the discriminative effects of CGS 15943 have a dopamine component that appears to be mediated by both the D1 and D2 families of dopamine receptors. The monkeys also generalized to selective inhibitors of the neuronal transporters of norepinephrine (nisoxetine) and serotonin (fluoxetine), indicating that monoamines other than dopamine also contribute to the discriminative effects of CGS 15943.",,Netherlands,1999,10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00346-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10440083

Anesthetized piglets were exposed to a sequence of 30 minutes of hypoxia, 5 minutes of room air ventilation, 7 minutes of airway occlusion, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Vehicle or NBQX was administered intravenously before asphyxia (30 mg/kg) and during the first 4 hours of recovery (15 mg/kg/h). Neuropathologic findings were evaluated at 96 hours of recovery by light microscopic and cytochrome oxidase histochemical study. Cardiac arrest occurred at 5 to 6 minutes of airway occlusion, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored spontaneous circulation independent of treatment modalities in about 2 to 3 minutes. Neurologic deficit over the 96-hour recovery period was not ameliorated by NBQX. Seizure activity began after 24 to 48 hours in 7 of 10 animals with vehicle and in 9 of 10 of animals with NBQX. In each group, four animals died in status epilepticus. Neuropathologic outcomes were not improved by NBQX. The density of remaining viable neurons was decreased in parietal cortex and putamen by NBQX treatment. Metabolic defects in cytochrome oxidase activity were worsened by NBQX treatment. Seizure activity during recovery was associated with reduced neuronal viability in neocortex and striatum in piglets from both groups that survived for 96 hours. This neonatal model of asphyxic cardiac arrest and resuscitation generates neurologic deficits, clinical seizure activity, and selective damage in regions of basal ganglia and sensorimotor cortex.

Consequently, the present study using in vivo microdialysis was undertaken to (i) characterize the effects of alpha2D, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor stimulation or blockade on 5-HT efflux in the FC given the purported regulatory role of these sites on 5-HT release, and (ii) to investigate the ability of risperidone to interfere with these receptors in order to examine their putative role in the facilitatory action or risperidone on cortical 5-HT output. Cortical perfusion with risperidone or the alpha2A/D, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonists idazoxan, isamoltane or GR 127,935, respectively, dose-dependently increased 5-HT efflux in the FC. Conversely, agonists at these receptors, i.e. clonidine, CP 93,129 or CP 135,807, respectively, decreased extracellular 5-HT concentrations. The agonist-induced decreases in 5-HT efflux were antagonized by coadministration of respective receptor antagonists. Risperidone attenuated the decrease in cortical 5-HT efflux elicited by clonidine or CP 135,807 but failed to affect the decrease elicited by CP 93,129. The present in vivo biochemical data indicate that the output of 5-HT in the FC is negatively regulated via alpha2D, 5-HT1B and tentatively also via 5-HT1D receptors located in the nerve terminal area. Moreover, the results indicate that risperidone acts as an antagonist at alpha2D and possibly 5-HT1D receptors in vivo, two properties which most likely contribute to its stimulatory effect on cortical 5-HT efflux. The facilitatory effect of risperidone on cortical serotonergic neurotransmission may be of significance for its therapeutic effect in schizophrenia, particularly when associated with affective symptomatology and/or intense anxiety. The effect may also contribute to alleviate signs of cortical dysfunction such as impaired cognition.",,England,1999,10.1016/s0028-3908(99)00045-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10462130

Pre-clinical animals studies suggest that hypericum is effective in three major biochemical systems relevant for antidepressant activity, namely the inhibition of the synaptic re-uptake system for serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA). It is the only antidepressant capable of inhibiting the re-uptake of 5-HT, NA and DA with similar potencies. The potencies for monoamine re-inhibition and chronic changes in receptors are also consistent with changes seen with known antidepressants. Behavioral studies suggest that hypericum is active in pre-clinical animal models of depression with comparable effects to known antidepressants. Supporting the pre-clinical pharmacology and efficacy, many clinical studies have shown that hypericum has superior efficacy compared to placebo and comparable efficacy to standard antidepressants in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. The advantage of hypericum over other antidepressants may result from its favorable side-effect profile. Although pre-clinical and short-term clinical studies demonstrate antidepressant activity, the lack of long-term use and efficacy, and the heterogeneity of patients, interventions, extract preparations from previous clinical studies suggests that more careful and controlled studies are needed to determine the long-term efficacy of hypericum in mild-to-moderate depression.",,England,1999,10.1038/sj.mp.4000557,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10483049

Herein, we examined mechanisms underlying the influence of buspirone alone, and in association with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, upon extracellular levels of serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline simultaneously quantified in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats. Buspirone (0.01-2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-dependently decreased dialysate levels of serotonin (-50%), and increased those of dopamine (+100%) and noradrenaline (+140%). The reduction by buspirone of serotonin levels was abolished by the serotonin1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100,635 (0.16), which did not, however, modify its influence upon dopamine and noradrenaline. In contrast to buspirone, the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (10.0), increased frontocortical levels of serotonin (+ 120%), dopamine (+55%) and noradrenaline (+90%). Buspirone dose-dependently (0.01-2.5) decreased the induction by fluoxetine of serotonin levels yet potentiated (three-fold) its elevation of dopamine and noradrenaline levels. The serotonin1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)-tetralin (0.16), mimicked the action of buspirone in reducing resting levels of serotonin (-60%) and in enhancing those of dopamine (+135%) and noradrenaline (+165%). Like buspirone, it attenuated the influence of fluoxetine upon serotonin levels, yet facilitated its influence upon dopamine and noradrenaline levels. In contrast, WAY 100,635 selectively potentiated the increase in levels of serotonin (two-fold) versus dopamine and noradrenaline elicited by fluoxetine. Further, WAY 100,635 abolished the inhibitory influence of buspirone upon fluoxetine-induced serotonin release, but only partly interfered with its potentiation of fluoxetine-induced increases in dopamine and noradrenaline levels. The D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride (0.16), increased basal dopamine (+60%) levels but little influenced those of serotonin and noradrenaline, and failed to modify the action of fluoxetine. The alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl-piperazine) (2.5), which did not modify resting levels of serotonin, markedly increased those of dopamine (+90%) and noradrenaline (+190%) and potentiated (two-fold) the increases in dialysate levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin provoked by fluoxetine. Further, the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist, S18616, attenuated the enhancement by buspirone of the fluoxetine-induced increase in levels of dopamine and noradrenaline. In conclusion, the inhibitory influence of buspirone upon resting and fluoxetine-stimulated serotonin levels reflects its agonist properties at serotonin1A autoreceptors. The facilitatory influence of buspirone upon resting and fluoxetine-stimulated dopamine and noradrenaline levels may also involve its serotonin1A properties. However, its principal mechanism of action in this respect is probably the alpha2-adrenergic antagonist properties of its metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl-piperazine).

This forces the reversal of the Na(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent NE transporter (NET), triggering massive carrier-mediated NE release and, thus, arrhythmias. We have now developed a cellular model of carrier-mediated NE release using an LLC-PK(1) cell line stably transfected with human NET cDNA (LLC-NET). LLC-NET cells transported [(3)H]NE and [(3)H]N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ([(3)H]MPP(+)) in an inward direction. This uptake was abolished by the NET inhibitors desipramine (100 nM) and mazindol (300 nM) and by extracellular Na(+) removal. Na(+)-gradient reversal induced an efflux of (3)H-substrate from preloaded LLC-NET cells. Desipramine and mazindol blocked this efflux. Because of its greater intracellular stability and higher sensitivity to Na(+)-gradient reversal, [(3)H]MPP(+) proved preferable to [(3)H]NE as an NET substrate; therefore, only [(3)H]MPP(+) was used for subsequent studies. The K(+)/H(+) ionophore nigericin (10 microM) evoked a large efflux of [(3)H]MPP(+). This efflux was potentiated by the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase inhibitor ouabain (100 microM), was sensitive to desipramine, and was blocked by the NHE inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA; 10 microM). In contrast, EIPA failed to inhibit the [(3)H]MPP(+) efflux elicited by the Na(+) ionophore gramicidin (10 microM). Furthermore, [(3)H]MPP(+) efflux induced by the NHE-stimulant proprionate (25 mM) was negatively modulated by imidazoline receptor activation.

Maternal ipsapirone treatment exerted a protective effect.,Tajuddin NF and Druse MJ ,Brain research. Developmental brain research,,"Prior studies from this laboratory showed that in utero ethanol exposure severely retards the development of the serotonin (5-HT) system; we demonstrated a reduced concentration of 5-HT and 5-HT reuptake sites and alterations in the concentration of 5-HT(1A) receptors in ethanol-exposed offspring. These investigations also found that maternal treatment with a 5-HT(1A) agonist, buspirone, prevented most of the ethanol-associated damage to the developing 5-HT system. In the present investigation, we investigated whether the ethanol-associated changes in the 5-HT system are due to a reduction of 5-HT neurons and whether any changes in the density of 5-HT neurons can be prevented by maternal treatment with another 5-HT(1A) agonist, ipsapirone. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that in utero ethanol exposure reduced the density of 5-HT immunopositive neurons in the dorsal raphe, median raphe and B9 neurons of postnatal day 5 (PN5) rats. In all three brain areas, the offspring of ethanol-fed, saline-treated dams exhibited a 28%-40% reduction in 5-HT neurons. Ipsapirone prevented the ethanol-induced reduction in 5-HT immunopositive neurons in the dorsal raphe, median raphe and B9 neurons. In the dorsal and median raphe of control offspring, ipsapirone did not alter the concentration of 5-HT neurons.

It inhibits the synaptosomal uptake of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and noradrenaline, suggesting a biochemical mechanism similar to the synthetic standard antidepressants. In the present study, further investigating this hypothesis, we confirmed that a hydromethanolic extract of H. perforatum inhibited [3H]5-HT accumulation in rat brain cortical synaptosomes with an IC50 value of 7.9 microg/ml. The IC50 of pure hyperforin was 1.8 microg/ml, so the activity of the total extract is not related only to its hyperforin content (<5%). This inhibitory effect, however, is not due to a direct interaction with, and blockade of, the 5-HT transporters since the extract, like hyperforin, did not inhibit [3H]citalopram binding (IC50 > 100 microg/ml and 10 microg/ml, respectively). We also found that 3-10 microg/ml of the extract, or 0.3-1 microg/ml hyperforin, induced marked tritium release from superfused synaptosomes previously loaded with [3H]5-HT. The releasing effect of the extract resembles the releasing effect of a reserpine-like compound (Ro 04-1284), i.e. it was slightly delayed and was 5-HT carrier- and calcium-independent. These data suggest that the hydromethanolic extract of H. peforatum, similarly to Ro 04-1284, rapidly depletes storage vesicles, raising the cytoplasmic concentration of 5-HT, and this increase is presumably responsible for the apparent inhibition of [3H]5-HT uptake. Therefore, our in vitro data do not confirm that the hydromethanolic extract of H. perforatum acts as a classical 5-HT uptake inhibitor but indicate reserpine-like properties. However, the concentrations of the active component(s) effective in vitro as reserpine-like agent(s) (i.e. corresponding to > or =3 microg/ml of the hydromethanolic extract) do not seem to be achieved in the brain after pharmacologically effective doses of the extract, as indicated by the finding that there were no significant changes of rat brain 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels after a schedule of treatment (3 x 300 mg/kgday, orally) active in an animal model predictive of antidepressant-like activity. These data also suggest that the antidepressant effect of H. perforatum extracts is unlikely to be associated with interaction with GABA, benzodiazepine and 5-HT1 receptors since, in receptor binding studies, we found IC50 values higher than 5 microg/ml. Therefore other, still unknown, mechanisms are possibly involved in H. perforatum antidepressant effects.",,Germany,1999,10.1007/s002109900073,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10543427

Local perfusion of fluoxetine (30 and 100 microM) increased dopamine levels in a concentration-dependent manner. The fluoxetine (100 microM)-induced increases in dopamine release were abolished by pretreatment with the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR 127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5- methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide] ) (10 and 100 microM). The facilitation of dopamine release was also prevented by selective inactivation of the mRNA encoding 5-HT(6) receptors using antisense oligonucleotides techniques. These findings suggest that not only 5-HT(1B) receptors but also 5-HT(6) receptors are associated with the endogenous 5-HT-mediated facilitation of dopamine release.

Molecular brain research,,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible enzyme involved in heme catabolism, tissue iron homeostasis and the cellular response to oxidative stress. Elevated HO-1 expression in astrocytes has been observed in association with abnormal iron deposition and increased oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease (PD). Since HO-1 could contribute to these aspects of PD pathobiology we have investigated its regulation in cultured astrocytes and C6 glioma cells. Here we report that dopamine is a potent inducer of HO-1. This induction is not mediated by a classical dopamine receptor and is not mimicked by a range of catecholamines and dopamine metabolites. When the time-course of HO-1 expression was compared between dopamine and hemin, the latter induced the gene immediately while the former did so with a lag. This suggested two distinct signal transduction pathways. However, cycloheximide blocked both hemin- and dopamine-induced HO-1 expression, suggesting that both pathways may involve proteins with short half-lives. Ascorbic acid blocked dopamine induction of HO-1 but had no effect on hemin-induced expression. This suggested that dopamine may signal upstream of the unstable protein by producing pro-oxidant metabolites or byproducts. Inhibition of monoamine oxidases A or B or catechol-O-methyl transferase did not block HO-1 induction by dopamine, indicating that these enzymes were not converting dopamine to an active metabolite. These results suggest that dopamine, released or secreted from affected neurons, may trigger HO-1 expression in neighboring astrocytes.

To determine the consequences of this cerebellar pathology on the noradrenergic system, noradrenaline transporters as well as alpha1-, alpha2- and beta-adrenergic receptors were evaluated by quantitative ligand binding autoradiography in adult control and pcd mice using, respectively, [3H]nisoxetine, [3H]prazosin, [3H]idazoxan and [3H]CGP12177. In cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei of pcd mutants, [3H]nisoxetine labelling of noradrenaline transporters was higher than in control mice. However, when binding densities were corrected by surface area, they remained unchanged in the cerebellar cortex but associated with 25% and 40% lower levels of labelling of alpha1 and beta receptors, as well as a very important increase (275%) of alpha2 receptors. In deep cerebellar nuclei, surface corrections did not reveal any changes either in transporter or in receptor densities. Higher densities of [3H]nisoxetine labelling were found in several regions related with the cerebellum, namely inferior olive, inferior colliculus, vestibular, reticular, pontine, raphe and red nuclei, as well as in primary motor and sensory cerebral cortex; they may reflect an increased noradrenergic innervation related to motor adjustments for the cerebellar dysfunction. Increased [3H]nisoxetine labelling was also measured in vegetative brainstem regions and in dorsal hypothalamus, implying altered autonomic functions and possible compensation in pcd mutants. Other changes found in extracerebellar regions affected by the mutation, such as thalamus and the olfactory system implicated both noradrenaline transporters and adrenergic receptors. In contrast to the important alterations of the noradrenergic system in cerebellar cortex, the lack of receptor changes in deep cerebellar nuclei suggests that local adaptations may be sufficient to minimize the consequence of the cerebellar atrophy on motor control.

In response to R(-)-2, 10, 11-trihydroxy-N-propyl-noraporphine hydrobromide (TNPA, 75 microg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, the intraocular pressure decreased by 4.5 and 8 mm Hg at 1 and 2 hr, respectively, as measured by pneumatonometry. The levels of norepinephrine in aqueous humor, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, were reduced by 38% and 79% at 1 and 2 hr, respectively, following topical application of TNPA (75 microg). Following pretreatment with raclopride (750 microg), a D2 receptor antagonist, and a subsequent challenge with TNPA (75 microg), the depression of intraocular pressure and levels of norepinephrine induced by TNPA (75 microg, 2 hr) were antagonized. In order to examine sites of action, immunohistochemistry of D2 dopamine receptors was performed in the ciliary body of normal and sympathetically denervated rabbits utilizing a goat polyclonal D2 receptor IgG and anti-goat IgG-FITC. Results from immunolocalization experiments demonstrated that D2 receptors are present on postganglionic sympathetic nerves in the ciliary body of normal rabbits but minimally detectable in that of sympathectomized rabbits. It is concluded that immunohistochemical identification of D2 receptors in the ciliary body associated with the suppression of aqueous norepinephrine levels by topical application of the D2 receptor agonist, TNPA, provide strong evidence of prejunctional (neuronal) site of action of TNPA. Antagonism of TNPA-induced ocular hypotension by raclopride coupled with the immunohistochemical and norepinephrine data suggest that D2 dopamine receptors are located on postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the ciliary body.",,England,1999,10.1006/exer.1999.0734,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10620390

However, direct evidence of a hyperdopaminergic state in schizophrenia has been difficult to demonstrate, given the difficulty of measuring dopamine transmission in the living human brain. This situation is rapidly changing. Recent developments in positron emission tomography and single-photon emission tomographic techniques enabled measurement of acute fluctuation of synaptic dopamine in the vicinity of D2 receptors. Using this technique, we, and others, measured the increase in dopamine transmission following acute amphetamine challenge in untreated patients with schizophrenia and matched healthy subjects. Following a brief overview of these new brain imaging techniques, the main results derived with this method in patients with schizophrenia are described: (1) amphetamine-induced dopamine release is elevated in patients with schizophrenia, supporting the idea that schizophrenia is associated with dysregulation of dopamine transmission; (2) following amphetamine, hyperactivity of dopamine transmission is associated with activation of psychotic symptomatology; (3) this dysregulation of dopamine release is not a long-term consequence of previous neuroleptic treatment, and is detected in never-medicated patients experiencing a first episode of the illness; and (4) in contrast, this exaggerated response of the dopamine system to amphetamine exposure is not detected in patients studied during a period of illness stabilization, suggesting that the hyperdopaminergic state associated with schizophrenia fluctuates over time. In conclusion, a hyperdopaminergic state might be present in schizophrenia during the initial episode and subsequent relapses, but not during periods of remission.

A single dose of MDEA (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg IP) induced a dose-related hyperthermia, but only the highest dose significantly reduced 5-HT content and 5-HT transporter density in the frontal cortex and in the hippocampus 7 days later. Long-term serotonergic deficits were much more marked when MDEA was given repeatedly (40 mg/kg IP., b.i.d., for 4 consecutive days). Single or repeated administration of MDEA induced no change on 5-HT1A receptor density in the frontal cortex, brain stem, or hippocampus, although 3 h after both treatments plasma corticosterone levels were significantly increased. MDEA (5-20 mg/kg, IP) produced significant retention deficits in a passive-avoidance learning task.

The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635, prevented the impairment in retention performance induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), but not by MDEA or MDMA, indicating that the effect of these amphetamine derivates was not mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation.

We hypothesized that serotonergic neurotransmission in the SCN is decreased in middle-aged hamsters, as compared to young adults. This hypothesis was tested indirectly by investigating the effect of aging on two markers of serotonin neurotransmission, 5-HT(1B) receptors and serotonin reuptake sites, which are regulated by serotonin. Previous studies have shown that experimentally induced decreases in serotonergic neurotransmission increase 5-HT(1B) receptors but decrease serotonin reuptake sites. Quantitative autoradiography was conducted using [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP) and [3H]paroxetine, selective radioligands for the 5-HT(1B) receptors and the serotonin reuptake sites, respectively. Consistent with the hypothesis, specific ([125I]ICYP binding was significantly elevated in the SCN of middle-aged hamsters, as compared to young hamsters. The results also showed that serotonin reuptake sites in the SCN were significantly increased in both middle-aged and old hamsters, as compared to young controls. This result could not have been caused by decreased serotonin release. Alternatively, increased serotonin reuptake, which would reduce serotonin levels in the synaptic cleft, may cause or contribute to the increase in 5-HT(1B) receptor binding in the SCN in middle aged animals. These results show that the SCN exhibits changes in serotonergic function during middle age, which has been characterized by changes in the expression of circadian rhythms. Because these changes occur during middle age, they probably reflect the aging process, rather than senescence or disease.",,Netherlands,2000,10.1016/s0006-8993(99)02397-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10677628

Serotonin levels were monitored through a carbon-fiber microelectrode by fast cyclic voltammetry (usually at 1 Hz). Single-cell firing was recorded through the same microelectrode, except during the voltammetry waveform and associated electrical artifact (totaling about 30 ms). Multi-barrel micropipettes incorporating the voltammetry electrode were used for iontophoresis of drugs. Cells were inhibited, excited or unaffected by noxious mechanical skin stimulation. These were respectively designated as off(M) cells, on(M) cells and neutral(M) cells, M denoting mechanical. During 3 min of pinching, serotonin slowly rose near seven of 14 on(M) cells and 26 of 46 off(M) cells; it fell near two off(M) cells; it was unchanged near all other cells, including six neutral(M) cells. On a finer spatiotemporal scale, near four of seven on(M) cells, 10 of 14 off(M) cells and 0 of four neutral(M) cells, average serotonin levels fell significantly within +/- 100 ms of spontaneous spikes. Lower serotonin may have caused the higher spike probability; the converse is theoretically unlikely, since delays between release and detection are estimated to exceed 100 ms. Increased serotonin and decreased firing were always seen following iontophoresis or intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine (n = 7). Iontophoresis of +/- propranolol, whose serotonergic actions include antagonism and partial agonism at 5-HT1 receptors, also increased serotonin and decreased firing (n=4). Methiothepin (intravenous, 1 mg/kg), whose serotonergic actions include 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonism, typically raised serotonin levels (four of five cells) and always blocked inhibition by clomipramine (n = 3). Iontophoresis of glutamate always lowered serotonin and increased firing (n = 4). Since serotonin levels and firing were usually inversely correlated, except near on(M) cells during pinch, we propose that serotonin is released from terminals of incoming nociceptive afferents. Prior neuroanatomical knowledge favors a midbrain origin for these afferents, while some of the drug findings suggest that their terminals possess inhibitory serotonergic autoreceptors, possibly of 5-HT1b subtype. The released serotonin could contribute to the inhibition of off(M) cells and excitation of on(M) cells by noxious stimulation, since inhibitory 5-HT1a receptors and excitatory 5-HT2 receptors, respectively, have previously been shown to dominate their serotonergic responses.",,United States,2000,10.1016/s0306-4522(99)00516-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10682715

Several studies have reported that the excitatory actions of ionotropic glutamate agonists on extracellular dopamine levels in striatum are resistant to tetrodotoxin, which suggests that glutamate excites an impulse-independent mechanism of dopamine release. We tested the hypothesis that an inhibitory action of glutamate on dopamine terminals in the striatum specifically involves an impulse-dependent mechanism of dopamine release. We used voltammetry to monitor electrically-evoked dopamine release in striatal slices, which is completely tetrodotoxin- and Ca(2+)-sensitive and so provides a model of impulse-dependent dopamine release. Agonists of the ionotropic glutamate receptors significantly decreased the amplitude of the response, while antagonists significantly increased the amplitude of the response, by as much as approximately 60% in the case of kynurenic acid. These results support the hypothesis that ionotropic glutamate receptors can inhibit impulse-dependent dopamine release by a mechanism that acts locally within the striatum. This finding contrasts with previous reports that glutamate can excite impulse-independent dopamine release. This extends earlier findings that glutamate may both excite and inhibit subcortical dopamine systems by suggesting that the excitatory and inhibitory actions of striatal ionotropic glutamate receptors are specifically associated with impulse-independent and impulse-dependent dopamine release, respectively.",,United States,2000,10.1016/s0306-4522(99)00539-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10683411

Elevation of brain 5-HT by the combined administration of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP, 5 mg/kg, i.p.), and the 5-HT precursor L-tryptophan (L-TP, 100 mg/kg, i.p.), increased Arc mRNA abundance in the cingulate, orbital, frontal and parietal cortices as well as in the striatum but a reduction was observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The 5-HT releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) also increased Arc mRNA in the cortical and striatal areas. Depleting brain 5-HT with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 300 mg/kg, i.p. for two days), on the other hand, significantly attenuated the increase in Arc mRNA induced by tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan (TCP/L-TP). Pretreatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (2 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the effect of TCP/L-TP in the cortex but only partially in striatum and did not affect the reduction in the CA1 region. The 5-HT2 agonist DOI (0.2, 1 and 2 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently increased Arc mRNA abundance in cortical areas with a pattern similar to that of TCP/L-TP and PCA. DOI, however, had much weaker effects on Arc mRNA in the striatum and did not have any significant effect in the CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyms (DG) of the hippocampus. Pretreatment with ketanserin completely blocked the effect of DOI on Arc expression. These data suggest that Arc mRNA expression can be induced in the cortex by increases in extracellular 5-HT and that 5-HT2 receptors play a major part in mediating such effects. Additional 5-HT receptors as well as other neurotransmitters may also be involved, particularly in the striatum and in CA1 subfield of the hippocampus. Overall, our data suggest that expression of Arc mRNA is highly responsive to changes in brain 5-HT functions, and may provide a sensitive marker of postsynaptic 5-HT2(2A and 2C) receptor functions.",,England,2000,10.1016/s0028-3908(99)00148-3,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10698012

In this study the effects of MDMA on the expression of c-fos mRNA by in situ hybridization as well as the c-fos-like protein by immunohistochemistry in isolated dorsal striatum was investigated. It was shown that 100 microM MDMA induced c-fos mRNA expression 30 min after treatment. Expression of c-fos-like protein was transiently detected 3 h afterwards. The c-fos expression was inhibited by MK 801 and metoclopramide, indicating the involvement of dopaminergic D2 receptors and glutamatergic NMDA receptors. The dopaminergic D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 did not affect c-fos expression. We conclude that MDMA treatment leads to the induction of c-fos expression in isolated rat striatal slices.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) is a potent inhibitor of feeding, and its release from the hypothalamus is stimulated by IL-1. We have tested the hypotheses that anorexia associated with experimental colitis results from increased activity of hypothalamic 5-HT neurons and that the increase in activity occurs secondary to an increase in availability of tryptophan, the precursor of 5-HT. METHODS: In vivo 5-HT release and regional hypothalamic 5-HT and tryptophan concentrations were measured in rats with 2,4,6,-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, healthy controls, and animals pair-fed to match the food intake of the colitic group. Food intake in the colitic group was assessed after depletion of brain 5-HT by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). RESULTS: In the colitic group, release of 5-HT from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was 3-fold (P = 0.01) and 14-fold (P < 0.001) higher than in control and pair-fed groups, respectively. Concentrations of tryptophan were similar in each group in all hypothalamic regions. Food intake was significantly increased in the colitic group after PCPA treatment but was not restored to control values. CONCLUSIONS: In animals with TNBS-induced colitis, 5-HT release from the PVN is increased. The increase in food intake after depletion of brain 5-HT suggests that hypothalamic 5-HT contributes to anorexia but is not the only mediator. Increased 5-HT release in the colitic group was not driven by increased precursor availability.",,United States,2000,10.1016/s0016-5085(00)70260-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10702205

Implications for neuroleptanesthesia.,Heyer EJ and Flood P ,Brain research,,"Droperidol is used in anesthesia as an antiemetic and as a component in neuroleptanalgesia. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve dopamine receptor blockade in the brain. The electrophysiological consequences associated with this action however, have not been elucidated. In this study we demonstrate a dose-dependent electrophysiological response to droperidol in central nervous system (CNS) neurons that express dopamine receptors that is absent in CNS neurons that do not express dopamine receptors. Primary dissociated cell (PDC) cultures were prepared from embryonal tissue dissected from ventral mesencephalon (VM) and spinal cord (SC). VM neurons were used to investigate the electrophysiological action of droperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, since these cultures contain neurons having dopamine receptors on their surface. SC neurons were used as a control as they do not express dopamine receptors. Some dopamine receptors are on dopaminergic neurons and therefore are called autoreceptors, while others are on nondopaminergic neurons, such as GABA producing (GABAergic) neurons. All neurons in both PDC cultures were spontaneously active. The percentage of neurons which spontaneously generated action potentials was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by droperidol (1 nM-10 microM) only in PDC cultures of VM. Exposure to droperidol had no effect on neurons from PDC cultures of SC which lack dopamine receptors. Our results suggest that droperidol modulates the electrophysiological properties of VM neurons with dopamine receptors possibly through facilitation of inhibitory interneurons.

Concurrent videotape recordings were used to establish a relationship between neuronal activity and particular behavioral events. In 14 of the 31 neurons, the firing rate changed in association with bouts of sexual activity. The remaining 17 fired with more variability regardless of episodes of sexual interactions. Peri-event histograms identified four types of neurons: type 1 (n=4) increased their firing rate when the female rats initiated proceptive behavior; type 2 (n=4) showed a brief activation when the male mounted; type 3 (n=4) fired in response to intromission, and type 4 (n=2) were inhibited prior to and throughout the display of lordosis reflex. Type 1 neurons fired at significantly higher rates during the solicitatory period, from the initiation of solicitatory locomotion to the male mounts. Their activity was suppressed when the males mounted successfully with intromission. Types 1-3 neurons were recorded from the transitional region between the medial and lateral POAs. Type 4 neurons were located more medially in the medial POA. Systemic injection of pimozide, a dopamine receptor blocker, diminished firing in type 1 neurons and abolished proceptivity. The firing pattern in type 1 neurons appeared to embody the motivational state of the animal with an implication for a consummatory value of penile intromission.

Changes in presynaptic adrenergic sensitivity as well as neuronal sensitivity to TNF have been implicated in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. The present study examines the influence of alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor activation on levels of TNF in regions of the brain associated with adrenergic function and the expression of mood. Additionally, the role of TNF as a neuromodulator is demonstrated by in vivo microinfusion of rrTNF proximal to the hippocampus. Administration to rats of an alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist (clonidine) decreases levels of TNF in homogenates of rat locus coeruleus and hippocampus within 7.5 min. Chronic (14 days) administration of the antidepressant drugs desipramine or zimelidine transforms alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor-dependent decreases in TNF levels to increases in levels of TNF in the locus coeruleus. This transformation to an increase in total levels of TNF also occurs, although transiently, in the hippocampus following acute (1 day) antidepressant drug administration. The effect of TNF on presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenergic sensitivity was also investigated. Field stimulation of hippocampal slices from rats microinfused with rrTNF proximal to the hippocampus for 14 days demonstrates a decrease in fractional release of [3H]NE and an increase in alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptor sensitivity. These data demonstrate a mutual dependence between alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor activation and levels of TNF in the central nervous system that would culminate in an increase in neurotransmitter release following antidepressant drug administration.",,Netherlands,2000,10.1016/s0165-5728(00)00244-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10808050

We have first established that a stable parkinsonian syndrome can be established by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) intoxication of adult male GÃ¶ttingen minipigs. We are now using positron emission tomography (PET) methods for testing the physiological responses to MPTP intoxication and the time course of the response to several treatment strategies. We now report preliminary results obtained in 11 pigs employed in the initial phase of the study; the completed study shall ultimately include 30 pigs. Animals were randomly assigned to one of five groups: 1) Control, 2) MPTP intoxication, 3) MPTP intoxication followed by allograft, 4) MPTP intoxication followed by allograft with immunosuppression, and 5) MPTP intoxication followed by allograft with immunosuppression and co-grafting of immortalized HiB5 cells, which had been manipulated to secrete glia cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (approximately 2 ng GDNF/h/10(5) cells). MPTP was administered (1 mg/kg/day, SC) for 7-10 days until the pigs had developed mild parkinsonian symptoms of muscle rigidity, hypokinesia, and impaired coordination, especially of the hind limbs. Approximately 2 weeks after the last MPTP dose, animals received a T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and a series of dynamic PET recordings. After the first series of PET scans, four grafts of porcine embryonic mesencephalic tissue (E28 days) were placed in each striatum of some MPTP-intoxicated pigs, using MRI-based stereotactic techniques. Immunosuppression of some animals with cyclosporin and prednisolone began just prior to surgery. Two more series of PET scans were performed at 4-month intervals after surgery. After the last scans, pigs were killed and the brains were perfused for unbiased stereological examination of cytological and histochemical markers in striatum and substantial nigra. The behavioral impairment of the animals (the ""Parkinson's score"") had been evaluated throughout the 8-month period. Kinetic analysis of the first set of PET scans has indicated that the rate constant for the decarboxylation of FDOPA in catecholamine fibers was reduced by 33% in striatum of the mildly parkinsonian pigs. The rate of association of [11C]NS-2214 to catecholamine uptake sites was reduced by 62% in the same groups of pigs. No significant difference was found in the binding potential of [11C]raclopride to the dopamine D2-like receptors in striatum of the MPTP-intoxicated versus control pigs. These preliminary results are suggestive that the activity of DOPA decarboxylase may be upregulated in the partially denervated pig striatum.",,United States,2000,10.1177/096368970000900210,"Journal Article and Multicenter Study and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10811397

This supports the view that glutamate deficiency plays an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia by altering the balance between glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems. Blockade of serotonin receptors counteracted the effect of dizocilpine on dopaminergic responses. Both the non-selective 5HT1/5HT2 antagonist methysergide, and ketanserin, which more specifically blocks 5HT2 receptors, given at doses inhibiting serotonin-mediated behaviours but which did not affect spontaneous motility and dopaminergic behaviours, hampered the dizocilpine-induced potentiation of responses elicited by the stimulation of D1 or D1/D2 dopamine receptors and counteracted the dizocilpine-induced reduction of hyperactivity observed following quinpirole administration.

After oral administration, significant antalarmin concentrations were detected in the systemic circulation and the cerebrospinal fluid by a mass spectrometry-gas chromatography assay developed specifically for this purpose. Pharmacokinetic and dose-response studies suggested that an oral dose of 20 mg/kg was optimal for behavioral and endocrine effects. We then administered this dose in a double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion to monkeys exposed to an intense social stressor: namely, placement of two unfamiliar males in adjacent cages separated only by a transparent Plexiglas screen. Antalarmin significantly inhibited a repertoire of behaviors associated with anxiety and fear such as body tremors, grimacing, teeth gnashing, urination, and defecation. In contrast, antalarmin increased exploratory and sexual behaviors that are normally suppressed during stress. Moreover, antalarmin significantly diminished the increases in cerebrospinal fluid CRH as well as the pituitary-adrenal, sympathetic, and adrenal medullary responses to stress. We conclude that CRH plays a broad role in the physiological responses to psychological stress in primates and that a CRH type 1 receptor antagonist may be of therapeutic value in human psychiatric, reproductive, and cardiovascular disorders associated with CRH system hyperactivity.",,United States,2000,10.1073/pnas.97.11.6079,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10823952

Significant increase or decrease in both [(3)H]citalopram binding and [(3)H]5-HT synaptosomal uptake were observed in various brain areas up to 2 weeks after a single administration of the sense plasmid or 7 d after injection of the short antisense plasmid, respectively. Such changes in 5-HTT expression were associated with functional alterations in 5-HT neurotransmission, as shown by the increased capacity of 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation to enhance [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding onto the dorsal raphe nucleus in sections from rats injected with the sense plasmid. Conversely, both a decrease in 5-HT(1A)-mediated [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding and a reduced potency of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist ipsapirone to inhibit neuronal firing were observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus of antisense plasmid-injected rats.

Both quetiapine and sertindole, in the two doses used, caused a more pronounced dopamine release in the shell than in the core region of the NAC. In contrast, the low dose of olanzapine increased dopamine output almost to the same extent in both regions, whereas the high dose increased dopamine output to a greater extent in the core. M100907 selectively increased dopamine output in the shell. Also, prazosin significantly increased dopamine output in the shell, but not in the core.

The high clinical potency of antipsychotics that act as antagonists at dopamine (DA) receptors indicate a hyperfunction of the dopaminergic system. The subiculum obtains information from area CA1 and the entorhinal cortex and represents the major output region of the hippocampal complex. To clarify whether an enhanced dopaminergic activity alters the hippocampal output, the effect of DA on alveus- and perforant path-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in subicular neurons was examined using conventional intracellular and whole cell voltage-clamp recordings. Dopamine (100 microM) depressed alveus-elicited (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated EPSCs to 56 +/- 8% of control while perforant path-evoked EPSCs were attenuated to only 76 +/- 7% of control. Dopamine had no effect on the EPSC kinetics. Dopamine reduced the frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs without affecting their amplitudes. The sensitivity of subicular neurons to the glutamate receptor agonist (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydoxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid was unchanged by DA pretreatment, excluding a postsynaptic mechanism for the observed reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission. The effect of DA on evoked EPSCs was mimicked by the D1 receptor agonist SFK 38393 and partially antagonized by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390. While the D2 receptor agonist quinelorane failed to reduce the EPSCs, the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride did not block the action of DA. The results indicate that DA strongly depresses the hippocampal and the entorhinal excitatory input onto subicular neurons by decreasing the glutamate release following activation of presynaptic D1-like DA receptors.",,United States,2000,10.1152/jn.2000.84.1.112,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10899189

To determine the pharmacological properties of dopamine D3 receptors in the rat caudate-putamen, we have investigated R(+)-[3H]7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT) binding to membrane preparations from the rat caudate-putamen. Kinetic analyses showed that [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding reached equilibrium in approximately 1 h and that both association and dissociation curves were composed of at least two components. Likewise, saturation curves showed at least two binding components with a combined Bmax value of about 600 fmol/mg protein, which is three times higher than what is present in the subcortical limbic area. Competition curves were performed with agonists such as R(-)-propylnorapomorphine, dopamine, PD 128907, quinpirole, and bromocriptine, and antagonists such as haloperidol, raclopride, clozapine, GR 218231x, remoxipride, and U99194A. These experiments revealed that [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding could be resolved into three specific binding sites (R1-R3) and one nonspecific binding site, with R1-R2 probably representing D3 receptor binding and the minor R3 representing D2 receptor binding. The low affinities of (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine to inhibit [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding indicate negligible involvement of 5-HT1A or sigma binding sites, respectively. The pharmacological profile of [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT (2 nM) binding in the caudate-putamen was similar to that of dopamine on [125I]iodosulpride binding in the cerebellar lobule X, which contain D3 but not D2 receptors. Mg2+ increased and GTP and Na+ decreased the binding of [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT, suggesting a coupling of endogenous D3 receptors to G proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that dopamine D3 receptors display multiple agonist binding states, and that D3 receptors are present in high concentrations in the rat caudate-putamen.

To gain a better understanding of the effects of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine, a specific serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, on central corticosteroid receptors, the effects of short-term activation of serotonin transmission on central corticosteroid receptor expression were analysed in adrenalectomized (ADX) rats either supplemented or not with corticosterone. Serotonin transmission was stimulated either by a single injection of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP), or by a 2-day treatment with fluoxetine. In ADX rats, administration of 5-HTP decreased hippocampal mineralocorticoid (MR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptor numbers 24 h later, while their respective mRNAs were unchanged and these effects of 5-HTP were mediated by 5-HT2 receptors. In the hypothalamus, GR mRNAs and binding sites decreased 3 h and 24 h after 5-HTP, respectively. By contrast, fluoxetine treatment increased hippocampal MR and GR mRNAs and MR binding sites while GR number remained unchanged. In ADX rats supplemented with corticosterone, 5-HTP and fluoxetine treatment had the same effects on corticosteroid receptors compared to those observed in non supplemented ADX rats: 5-HTP decreased hippocampal MR and GR and hypothalamic GR while fluoxetine treatment increased hippocampal MR. These results show that short-term stimulation of 5-HT transmission by 5-HTP decreases hippocampal and hypothalamic corticosteroid receptor numbers through a corticosterone-independent mechanism. It is hypothesized that the delayed maximal increase in extracellular 5-HT contents after fluoxetine treatment, due to negative feedback regulations induced by the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors, is not the primary cause for the delayed normalization of corticosteroid receptor numbers that regulates the HPA axis functioning.",,United States,2000,10.1046/j.1365-2826.2000.00509.x,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10929085

It has more recently been investigated and shown efficacy as a treatment for the behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with dementia in the elderly. Risperidone has pharmacological properties resembling those of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and an improved tolerability profile compared with the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone has antagonistic activity primarily at serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors. In the first 2 large, well controlled trials of an antipsychotic agent used in the treatment of elderly patients with Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia or mixed dementia, risperidone 1 mg/day was at least as effective as haloperidol and superior to placebo, as assessed by the rating scales for global behaviour, aggression and psychosis. In extension phases of the 2 trials, clinical benefits were maintained for treatment periods of up to 1 year, with an incidence rate of tardive dyskinesia (2.6%) one-tenth of that seen with conventional antipsychotics. Risperidone, administered at a low dosage of 1 mg/day was associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms compared with haloperidol in elderly patients. Risperidone was well tolerated with no clinically relevant abnormalities in laboratory tests, vital signs or electrocardiogram results. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of risperidone has been demonstrated in the treatment of the behavioural and psychological symptoms associated with dementia in the elderly. Preliminary results from 1-year extension studies confirm the favourable efficacy and tolerability profile of risperidone 1 mg/day. Although head to head studies with other atypical antipsychotic agents are required and the long term use of the drug requires clarification, risperidone represents a generally well tolerated and effective treatment in the management of dementia-associated behavioural and psychological symptoms in the elderly.",,New Zealand,2000,10.2165/00002512-200016060-00005,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10939309

Based on the data reviewed in the present study, it is suggested that nicotine by stimulating presynaptic alpha7 nicotinic receptors within the VTA, that are probably localized on glutamatergic afferents from the medial prefrontal cortex, produces sequentially an increase in glutamate concentrations, stimulation of NMDA receptors found on dopamine (DA)-containing neurons in the VTA, enhanced firing activity of VTA-DA neurons, augmented DA release in the nerve terminal regions, and enhanced c-fos expression in the dopaminergic projection areas through activation of D1-DA receptors. In addition, it appears that alpha7 nicotinic receptors within the VTA are directly involved in nicotine-related reward and withdrawal responses.

Perfusion of a glutamate-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (MK 801, dizocilpine, 10 microM) through the dialysis probe in the n. acc induced similar long-lasting increases in DA and DOPAC, whereas the glutamate-quisqualate/kainate receptor antagonist (CNQX, 50 microM) had no effect. In the presence of dizocilpine in the n. acc, microinjection of S-CM-GTNH2 into the DS could still increase DOPAC and HVA, but DA levels were not further changed, whereas in the presence of CNQX, microinjection of S-CM-GTNH2 into the DS still increased not only DOPAC and HVA, but also DA levels in a way similar to that in the absence of glutamate antagonist. Therefore, activation of 5-HT1B receptors located in the DS increases the release of DA in the n. acc, presumably via the glutamatergic projection to this structure and acting through NMDA receptors in it. This implies either the suppression of a tonic indirect inhibitory influence and/or stimulation of a phasic excitatory effect of glutamate. Disruption of latent inhibition (LI) has been suggested as a model for a cognitive deficit in schizophrenia (hyperattention to irrelevant stimuli) and is usually associated with an increase in DA release in the n. acc. However, s.c. injection of RU 24 969 (0.5 mg/kg), a mixed 5-HT1A-5-HT1B agonist, which was previously shown to increase DA release in the n. acc, left LI unchanged. Moreover, bilateral microinjections of S-CM-GTNH2 into the rat DS tended to potentiate LI, in spite of the increase in DA in n. acc demonstrated here. It is concluded that not all increases in DA release in the n. acc are functionally equivalent. Sensitization of receptors or impulse-dependent increase in DA release might be necessary to disrupt LI. The possible role of altered serotonergic transmission, through h5-HT1B receptors (human homologue of the rat 5-HT1B receptors) located in the DS, in acute schizophrenia needs to be further investigated.",,United States,1998,10.1177/026988119801200305,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10958252

This phenomenon, termed behavioral sensitization, is thought to underlie certain aspects of drug addiction. Behavioral sensitization is the consequence of drug-induced neuroadaptive changes in a circuit involving dopaminergic and glutamatergic interconnections between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex and amygdala. METHODS: The literature was critically reviewed in an effort to discern the relative roles of glutamate and dopamine transmission in the induction and expression of sensitization to amphetamine, cocaine and mu-opioids. In addition, the literature was reviewed to evaluate distinctions between these drugs in the involvement of the relevant brain nuclei listed above. RESULTS: The common substrates between sensitizing drugs are glutamate transmission, especially at the NMDA receptor, and an action in the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, a role for dopamine is only clearly seen in amphetamine sensitization and critical involvement of nuclei outside the ventral tegmental area is found for cocaine and morphine. While enhanced dopamine transmission is associated with sensitization by all three drugs, a role for glutamate is clearly identified only with cocaine sensitization. Accordingly, glutamatergic cortical and allocortical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex appear more critical for cocaine sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctions between drugs in the induction and expression of sensitization indicate that behavioral sensitization can arise from multiple neuroadaptations in multiple brain nuclei. This is not only the result of distinct molecular targets for the drugs, but may also include a differential involvement of learned associations. It is postulated that the relatively more robust pharmacological capacity of amphetamine to release dopamine may induce a form of sensitization that is more dependent on adaptations in mesoaccumbens dopamine transmission compared with cocaine and morphine sensitization.",,Germany,2000,10.1007/s002130000493,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-10972458

Except for fluoxetine and flibanserin, all the antidepressants antagonized by different degrees the 5-CT inhibitory response with the following rank affinity order: mianserin > maprotiline > imipramine > amitriptyline. Mianserin was the only antidepressant to show a profile of competitive antagonism at 5-HT7 receptors in a tenfold range of concentrations (0.1-1 microM), with an affinity (pA2) value of 8.1 +/- 0.6. The antagonism of the other antidepressants was not concentration-dependent (amitriptyline) or was associated with slight or moderate reduction of the maximal 5-CT response (imipramine or maprotiline). The apparent affinity (pKB) values were: amitriptyline, 7.0 +/- 0.2; maprotiline, 7.3 +/- 0.6; imipramine, 7.2 +/- 0.4. Our results show that various antidepressant drugs belonging to different chemical classes behave as antagonists at enteric 5-HT7 receptors through competitive or allosteric mechanisms.

This type of epilepsy, a generalized non-convulsive form, is associated with bursts of bilateral synchronous spike wave discharges (SWDs) recorded in the EEG. In a previous study, it was suggested that two features of the apomorphine-susceptible (APO-SUS) rat genotype, a relatively low dopaminergic reactivity of the nigrostriatal system and relatively high dopaminergic reactivity of the mesolimbic system, contribute to the high incidence of SWDs. Indeed, apomorphine-unsusceptible (APO-UNSUS) rats, characterized by opposite dopaminergic features, show considerably less SWDs than APO-SUS rats. The first goal of the present study was to assess the baseline SWD incidence in four rat genotypes (WAG/Rij, ACI, APO-SUS and APO-UNSUS) in order to replicate previous findings. It was expected that both the APO-SUS and WAG/Rij rats would show a considerably higher SWD incidence in comparison to the APO-UNSUS and ACI rats. For this purpose, rats were registered for a 19 hour period. Assuming that haloperidol decreases dopaminergic transmission in the nigrostriatal system via inhibition of the dopamine receptors and enhances dopaminergic transmission in the mesolimbic system via inhibition of the noradrenergic receptors, it was postulated that haloperidol would enhance the difference in dopaminergic reactivity between both systems in favor of the accumbens. Therefore, the second purpose in the present study was to investigate whether haloperidol (2 mg/kg, IP) could further potentiate SWD incidence when injected in the APO-SUS rats, already characterized by a relatively low dopaminergic reactivity of the nigrostriatal system and relatively high dopaminergic reactivity of the mesolimbic system, in comparison to the APO-UNSUS rat genotype. Finally, the third aim was to study if another epileptic rat genotype, the WAG/Rij, would show similar increases in SWD incidence following an injection with haloperidol as expected for the APO-SUS. First, previous findings were replicated: the value of the hourly number of SWDs decreased in the following order: APO-SUS > WAG/Rij > APO-UNSUS and ACI. Secondly, earlier data were extended by the fact that the APO-SUS responded to a systemic injection of haloperidol with an increase in SWD number and duration, in contrast to the APO-UNSUS rats. The hypothesis that the SWD incidence would be mostly affected by haloperidol in the APO-SUS rats, was confirmed by these findings. It is suggested that haloperidol increases the SWD incidence in APO-SUS rats by enhancing the difference between the dopaminergic reactivity in the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic system. Finally, further research is required to provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis that the relative dominance of the dopaminergic mesolimbic system is smaller in WAG/Rij than in APO-SUS.",,Ireland,2000,10.1016/s0168-0102(00)00154-1,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11000443

Thus, alcohol has been shown to increase dopamine transmission primarily by activating dopamine cell spike activity, whereas psychostimulants increase dopamine transmission by inhibiting the removal of dopamine from the synaptic space after its release. The spike-dependent release of dopamine that is modulated by drugs of abuse to lead to their rewarding actions has been termed the phasic dopamine response. In contrast, with repeated drug administration, dopamine will also accumulate in the extracellular space of the nucleus accumbens in concentrations too low to stimulate postsynaptic receptors, but of sufficient magnitude to activate dopamine release-inhibiting autoreceptors. In addition, the level of extracellular dopamine is proposed to be under the regulatory influence of cortico-accumbens afferents. This steady-state level of extrasynaptic dopamine has been termed the tonic dopamine response. In this paper it is proposed that several of the aspects of drug addiction, withdrawal and craving associated with the continued use of these drugs can be explained on the basis of their effects on tonic versus phasic dopamine system function. Thus, the increase in tonic dopamine levels that occurs with repeated drug administration would serve to oppose phasic dopamine release via stimulation of dopamine terminal autoreceptors, causing the subject to increase drug administration to restore the phasic response. Moreover, after withdrawal from the drugs, exposure to priming doses of drug or to drug-related stimuli are proposed to increase tonic dopamine levels, again triggering drug-seeking behavior in order to restore balance between the tonic and phasic dopamine systems. Therefore, one consequence of continued drug use is that these parameters of dopamine system function that normally serve to keep the system stable will enter into a new steady-state homeostasis, from which the system is particularly susceptible to destabilizing influences that may precipitate relapse.",,England,2000,10.1080/09652140050111690,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11002907

Recent studies reveal that dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) transporters (DAT, NET, and SERT, respectively) are rapidly regulated by direct or receptor-mediated activation of cellular kinases, particularly protein kinase C (PKC). With SERTs, PKC activation results in activity-dependent transporter phosphorylation and sequestration. Protein phosphatase 1/2A (PP1/PP2A) inhibitors, such as okadaic acid (OA) and calyculin A, also promote SERT phosphorylation and functional downregulation. How kinase, phosphatase, and transporter activities are linked mechanistically is unclear. In the present study, we found that okadaic acid-sensitive phosphatase activity is enriched in SERT immunoprecipitates from human SERT stably transfected cells. Moreover, blots of these immunoprecipitates reveal the presence of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), findings replicated using brain preparations. Whole-cell treatments with okadaic acid or calyculin A diminished SERT/PP2Ac associations. Phorbol esters, which trigger SERT phosphorylation, also diminish SERT/PP2Ac associations, effects that can be blocked by PKC antagonists as well as the SERT substrate 5-HT. Similar transporter/PP2Ac complexes were also observed in coimmunoprecipitation studies with NETs and DATs.

(1) Carbachol triggered beta waves (17.6 +/- 5.7 Hz) in pyramidal regions of 75% of the slices. (2) The waves had phase shifts across the cell body layers and were substantially larger in the apical dendrites than in cell body layers or basal dendrites. (3) Continuous, two-dimensional current source density analyses indicated apical sinks associated with basal sources, lasting approximately 10 msec, followed by apical sources and basal sinks, lasting approximately 20 msec, in a repeating pattern with a period in the range of 15-25 Hz. (4) Carbachol-induced beta waves in the hippocampus were accompanied by 40 Hz (gamma) oscillations in deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. (5) Cholinergically elicited beta and gamma rhythms were eliminated by antagonists of either AMPA or GABA receptors. Benzodiazepines markedly enhanced beta activity and sometimes introduced a distinct gamma frequency peak. (6) Twenty Hertz activity after orthodromic activation of field CA3 was distributed in the same manner as carbachol-induced beta waves and was generated by a current source in the apical dendrites of CA3. This source was eliminated by high concentrations of GABA(A) receptor blockers. It is concluded that cholinergically driven beta rhythms arise independently in hippocampal subfields from oscillatory circuits involving (1) bursts of pyramidal cell discharges, (2) activation of a subset of feedback interneurons that project apically, and (3) production of a GABA(A)-mediated hyperpolarization in the outer portions of the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons.",,United States,2000,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-22-08462.2000,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11069954

A nongenotoxic mechanism was investigated since the chloro-S-triazines are negative in short-term tests for genotoxicity. An in vivo battery was used to assess the chloro-S-triazines for estrogenic activity or for their ability to increase prolactin (PRL) levels, both of which play important roles in enhancing mammary gland tumorigenesis in rodents. Ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were treated with AZ, CZ, SZ, or three CZ metabolites for 4 days via intraperitoneal injection. The pattern of responses between the chloro-S-triazines and four controls (estradiol, estriol, haloperidol, reserpine) was compared. For the 6 end-points examined, the responses from rats treated with AZ, CZ, SZ, and the metabolites of CZ most closely matched the responses from the reserpine-treated rats (a PRL rather than estrogenic mechanism). In addition, AZ, CZ, and SZ were tested in several other in vitro models (estrogen/biogenic amine receptor competition assays and a yeast-expressed human estrogen receptor transcription assay) as well as an in vivo 24 h time-course experiment to characterize the CZ-induced increases in PRL levels. AZ, CZ, and SZ are not estrogen receptor (ER) activating compounds based on yeast transactivation and receptor competition data. CZ and AZ demonstrated marginal competition (at mM levels) to the D and alpha2 adrenergic receptors. Ligands to the D2 receptor, but not the alpha2 adrenergic receptor, are known to induce mammary tumors. CZ was also found to produce elevated PRL levels in a time-course similar to that seen with reserpine and haloperidol. Overall, the pattern of responses obtained with the chloro-S-triazines most closely matched the responses observed for reserpine.

Recently, many details of synaptic transmission have emerged. The identities of specific proteins important for synaptic vesicle release have now been established. We have investigated three synaptic proteins, VAMP (vesicle associated membrane protein; also called synaptobrevin), syntaxin, and SNAP25 (synaptosomal associated protein of 25kDa) as possible targets in the dopamine-mediated modulation of synaptic function in rat striatal slices. These three proteins form a SNARE (soluble N-ethylmalemide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) core complex that is known to be essential for synaptic transmission. Although it is envisioned that the SNAREs undergo dynamic and cyclic interactions to elicit synaptic vesicle release, their precise functions in neurotransmission remains unknown. We have examined SNARE complexes in intact rat striatal slices. Cellular proteins were solubilized, separated electrophoretically by SDS-PAGE, and then identified immunologically. Application of dopamine to striatal slices results in SNAREs favoring the SNARE core complex, a complex which forms spontaneously in the absence of crosslinking agents, rather than the monomer form. In addition, rapid crosslinking of dopamine-treated striatal slices demonstrates that the SNARE complex is increased 4 fold in dopamine treated striatal slices compared with control slices. Haloperidol blocked the dopamine-induced change in the core complex. These results suggest that changes in the activities of SNAREs may be involved in the underlying cellular mechanisms(s) of dopamine-regulated synaptic plasticity of the striatum.",,Canada,2000,,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11077986

To understand the basic cellular mechanisms that underlie these actions of dopamine (DA), we have investigated the influence of DA on the cellular properties of layer 3 pyramidal cells in area 46 of the macaque monkey PFC. Intracellular voltage recordings were obtained with sharp and whole cell patch-clamp electrodes in a PFC brain-slice preparation. All of the recorded neurons in layer 3 (n = 86) exhibited regular spiking firing properties consistent with those of pyramidal neurons. We found that DA had no significant effects on resting membrane potential or input resistance of these cells. However DA, at concentrations as low as 0.5 microM, increased the excitability of PFC cells in response to depolarizing current steps injected at the soma. Enhanced excitability was associated with a hyperpolarizing shift in action potential threshold and a decreased first interspike interval. These effects required activation of D1-like but not D2-like receptors since they were inhibited by the D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (3 microM) but not significantly altered by the D2 antagonist sulpiride (2.5 microM). These results show, for the first time, that DA modulates the activity of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in area 46 of monkey dorsolateral PFC in vitro.

Brain concentrations of reboxetine after 2 and 14 days of infusion were 37.9+/-17.8 and 37.1+/-7.7 ng g(-1), respectively. 4. Reboxetine infused for 2 and 14 days significantly increased extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, to a similar extent (257 and 342% of vehicle levels, respectively), whereas extracellular 5-HT was not modified by either treatment. 5. Clonidine (10 and 30 microg kg(-1) i.p.) reduced cortical extracellular noradrenaline similarly in animals treated with reboxetine or vehicle for 2 days whereas the effects in rats infused with reboxetine for 14 days were markedly less than in vehicle-treated animals. 6. Clonidine (0.05 and 0.2 microM), infused through the dialysis probe into the prefrontal cortex, reduced cortical extracellular noradrenaline much less in rats treated with reboxetine for 14 days than in vehicle-treated animals. 7. Reboxetine's effect on extracellular noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex was greater after chronic treatment and could be associated with desensitization of terminal alpha(2)-adrenoceptors that normally serve to inhibit noradrenaline release.",,England,2001,10.1038/sj.bjp.0703821,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11156576

In the present study, we investigated neuronal functions in mice lacking the GluRepsilon1 subunit. GluRepsilon1 mutant mice exhibited a malfunction of NMDA receptors, as evidenced by alterations of [(3)H]MK-801 binding as well as (45)Ca(2+) uptake through the NMDA receptors. A postmortem brain analysis revealed that both dopamine and serotonin metabolism were increased in the frontal cortex and striatum of GluRepsilon1 mutant mice. The NMDA-stimulated [(3)H]dopamine release from the striatum was increased, whereas [(3)H]GABA release was markedly diminished in GluRepsilon1 mutant mice. When (+)bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, was added to the superfusion buffer, NMDA-stimulated [(3)H]dopamine release was significantly increased in wild-type, but not in the mutant mice. GluRepsilon1 mutant mice exhibited an increased spontaneous locomotor activity in a novel environment and an impairment of latent learning in a water-finding task. Hyperlocomotion in GluRepsilon1 mutant mice was attenuated by treatment with haloperidol and risperidone, both of which are clinically used antipsychotic drugs, at doses that had no effect in wild-type mice. These findings provide evidence that NMDA receptors are involved in the regulation of behavior through the modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal systems. In addition, our findings suggest that GluRepsilon1 mutant mice are useful as an animal model of psychosis that is associated with NMDA receptor malfunction and hyperfunction of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuronal systems.",,United States,2001,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.21-02-00750.2001,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11160454

The cytoskeleton plays an essential role in the maintenance of cellular morphology and is subject to regulation by intracellular pathways associated with neurotransmitter receptors targeted by antipsychotic drugs. METHODS: We have examined whether chronic treatment with the antipsychotic drug haloperidol interferes with phosphorylation state and tissue levels of a major dendritic cytoskeleton-stabilizing agent, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), as well as levels of the dendritic spine-associated protein spinophilin and the synaptic vesicle-associated protein synaptophysin in various regions of the cerebral cortex of rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Among the cortical areas examined, the prefrontal, orbital, cingulate, motor, and entorhinal cortices displayed significant decreases in levels of spinophilin, and with the exception of the motor cortex, each of these regions also exhibited increases in the phosphorylation of MAP2. No changes were observed in either spinophilin levels or MAP2 phosphorylation in the primary visual cortex. Also, no statistically significant changes were found in tissue levels of MAP2 or synaptophysin in any of the cortical regions examined. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that long-term haloperidol exposure alters neuronal cytoskeleton- and spine-associated proteins, particularly in dopamine-rich regions of the primate cerebral cortex, many of which have been implicated in the psychopathology of schizophrenia. The ability of haloperidol to regulate cytoskeletal proteins should be considered in evaluating the mechanisms of both its palliative actions and its side effects.",,United States,2001,10.1016/s0006-3223(00)01058-1,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11163774

In the present study, the efficacy of several drugs was evaluated in an animal model of the 5-HT syndrome. When 2 mg/kg of clorgyline, a type-A monoamine oxidase inhibiting antidepressant, and 100 mg/kg of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT, were administered intraperitoneally to rats to induce the 5-HT syndrome, the rectal temperature of the rats increased to more than 40 degrees C, and all of the animals died by 90 min after the drug administration. The noradrenaline (NA) levels in the anterior hypothalamus, measured by microdialysis, increased to 15.9 times the preadministration level. Pretreatment with propranolol (10 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist as well as a beta-blocker, and dantrolene (20 mg/kg), a peripheral muscle relaxant, did not prevent the death of the animals, even though these two drugs suppressed the increase in rectal temperature to some extent. Chlorpromazine and cyproheptadine prevented the lethality associated with the 5-HT syndrome only at high doses. By contrast, pretreatment with ritanserin (3 mg/kg) and pipamperone (20 mg/kg), both potent 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists, completely prevented the increase in rectal temperature and death of the animals, and the hypothalamic NA levels in these two groups increased less than that in the other groups.

The antiallodynic action of alpha-m-5-HT was more potent than that of DOI. The effects of 5-HT(2) agonists on tactile allodynia were reversed by intrathecal pretreatment with the selective 5-HT(2) antagonist ketanserin and with the mixed 5-HT(1) and 5-HT(2) antagonist methysergide.

PCB treatment caused a decrease in hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations and significant inhibition of hypothalamic tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT synthesis, but did not alter the activity of monoamine oxidase, the catabolic enzyme. Further, PCB treatment caused significant decreases in GnRH content in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area. Significant decreases in pituitary GnRH receptor concentrations and the LH response to the GnRH analogue (GnRHa) were also observed in PCB-exposed fish, possibly as a consequence of a decline in GnRH release. The possible association between impaired serotonergic and neuroendocrine functions after PCB treatment was explored using serotonergic drugs. Treatment of croaker with p-chlorophenylalanine, an irreversible TPH inhibitor, mimicked the effects of PCB on the GnRH system and the LH response to GnRHa. Bypassing the TPH-dependent hydroxylation step with the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan restored 5-HT to control levels and prevented the deleterious effects of PCB on the neuroendocrine parameters. Moreover, slow-release GnRH implants prevented the PCB-induced decline in GnRH receptors and restored the LH response to GnRHa, suggesting that GnRH therapy can reverse PCB-induced disruption of LH secretion. These results demonstrate that TPH is one of the targets of PCB neurotoxicity and indicate that a decrease in 5-HT availability in PCB-exposed croaker results in disruption of the stimulatory 5-HT/GnRH pathway controlling LH secretion.",,United States,2001,10.1095/biolreprod64.3.955,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11207213

Phencyclidine or dopamine agonists, which causes psychotomimetic symptoms in humans, disrupts PPI in animals. The ED50 value of the drugs to reverse the phencyclidine-induced PPI disruption was significantly correlated with the affinity for the serotonin 2A receptor, but not for the dopamine D2 receptor of each drug (including atypical antipsychotics). In contrast, the ED50 value of the drugs to reverse the apomorphine-induced PPI disruption was significantly correlated with the affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor (including typical antipsychotics).

The involvement of the dopamine receptor subtypes was studied by systemic administration of the dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist, R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SCH 23390; 0.5 mg kg(-1)), or the dopamine D(2) antagonist, (5-aminosulphonyl)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-methyl]-2-methoxybenzamide (sulpiride, 30 mg kg(-1)). Microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography were used to monitor changes in extracellular levels of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, glutamate, aspartate and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). These data were correlated with changes in the striatal and cortical electroencephalographs and clinical signs. We found that, although neither dopamine receptor antagonist inhibited behavioural seizure activity, blockade of the dopamine D(1)-like receptor with SCH 23390 significantly reduced both the 'power' of the electrical seizure activity and the associated change in extracellular striatal concentration of glutamate, whilst increasing the extracellular striatal concentration of GABA. In contrast, blockade of the dopamine D(2)-like receptor with sulpiride significantly increased the extracellular, striatal content of glutamate and the dopamine metabolites.

Folia pharmacologica Japonica,,"Repeated administration of psychostimulants like methamphetamine and cocaine induce behavioral sensitization, which is recognized as an animal model for dependence and psychoses. Many previous studies have proved two major cascades play a crucial roles for molecular mechanisms underling sensitization. The first one is activation of D1 dopamine receptors by robust increase of dopamine release, followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase, increase of cyclic AMP, activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphorylation of proteins by PKA. The second one is activation of NMDA receptor by enhanced release of glutamine, followed by increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration, formation of Ca2+/calmodulin complex, and phosphorylation of several proteins such as calcineurin, CaM-K II and nitric oxide synthase. Recent advanced findings on sensitization mechanisms were reviewed from three different aspects: 1) Studies using knockout mice offered quite amazing findings that D1DA-receptor-lacking mice or dopamine-transporter-lacking mice can develop sensitization and dependence, which were not consistent with the previously established hypotheses based on behavioral pharmacology. In addition, those data showed the important roles of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, 5HT1B receptors and delta FosB. 2) Research on neural-plasticity-related sensitization revealed the involvement of several molecules such as tissue plasminogen activator, arc (activity-regulated, cytoskeleton-associated), synaptophysin and stathmin. Increased expression of these genes may participate in the rearrangement of neural networks with synaptogenesis and expansion of dendrites 3) Trials to discover novel-genes-involved sensitization phenomenon using differential display or subtraction cloning found some candidate genes, mrt-1, NAC-1 and CART.

Extracellular dopamine concentrations were assessed utilizing differential normal pulse voltammetry in chloral hydrate anesthetized, pargyline pretreated rats. Intravenous administration of PCP (0.5 mg/kg) or MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) both significantly elevated extracellular dopamine levels in the NAC shell but not in the core. However, administration of relatively low doses of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 39551 (2.5 mg/kg) failed to affect dopamine output in either region. However, when a higher dose (10 mg/kg) was administered a significant elevation in dopamine output was obtained in the shell compared to the core. Our data demonstrate that non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists evoke an accumbal dopamine output that is selective to limbic cortical related NAC regions. This profile is shared also by competitive NMDA receptor antagonists when given in high, but not low doses. Our results are compatible with the reported elicitation of PCP-like behavioral effects by competitive NMDA receptor antagonists when administered in relatively high doses. Moreover, these findings suggest that differences in the regional accumbal dopamine output between competitive and non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonists may be essentially attributable to the relative degree of NMDA receptor antagonism achieved by the drugs.

This study was designed to assess the molecular and cellular events involved in the up-regulation (and receptor supersensitivity) of brain alpha(2)-adrenoceptors as a result of chronic depletion of noradrenaline (and other monoamines) by reserpine. 2. Chronic reserpine (0.25 mg kg(-1) s.c., every 48 h for 6 - 14 days) increased significantly the density (B(max) values) of cortical alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist sites (34 - 48% for [(3)H]-UK14304, 22 - 32% for [(3)H]-clonidine) but not that of antagonist sites (11 - 18% for [(3)H]-RX821002). Competition of [(3)H]-RX821002 binding by (-)-adrenaline further indicated that chronic reserpine was associated with up-regulation of the high-affinity state of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. 3. In cortical membranes of reserpine-treated rats (0.25 mg kg(-1) s.c., every 48 h for 20 days), the immunoreactivities of various G proteins (Galphai(1/2), Galphai(3), Galphao and Galphas) were increased (25 - 34%). Because the high-affinity conformation of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor is most probably related to the complex with Galphai(2) proteins, these results suggested an increase in signal transduction through alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (and other monoamine receptors) induced by chronic reserpine. 4. After alpha(2)-adrenoceptor alkylation, the analysis of receptor recovery (B(max) for [(3)H]-UK14304) indicated that the increased density of cortical alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in reserpine-treated rats was probably due to a higher appearance rate constant of the receptor ((Delta)r=57%) and not to a decreased disappearance rate constant ((Delta)k=7%). 5. Northern- and dot-blot analyses of RNA extracted from the cerebral cortex of saline- and reserpine-treated rats (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c., every 48 h for 20 days) revealed that reserpine markedly increased the expression of alpha(2a)-adrenoceptor mRNA in the brain (125%).

Basal DA release in SHRSP was uniformly lower in all regions tested than that in age-matched control Wistar Kyoto rats. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid levels were altered in the basolateral amygdala, dorsal hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of SHRSP. While basal 5-HT release decreased in the striatum and increased in the basolateral amygdala, there was no associated change in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels. Systemic administration of aniracetam to SHRSP enhanced both DA and 5-HT release with partly associated change in their metabolite levels in the prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala and dorsal hippocampus, but not in the striatum and nucleus accumbens shell, in a dose-dependent manner (30 and/or 100 mg/kg p.o.). Microinjection (1 and 10 ng) of aniracetam or its metabolites (N-anisoyl-GABA and 2-pyrrolidinone) into the nucleus accumbens shell produced no turning behavior.

Given the association between NMDA receptor function and nitric oxide (NO) production with the regulation of 5-HT release in other brain regions, we have studied this in rat hippocampus. NMDA (100 microM) decreased hippocampal 5-HT release by approximately 70% and this was reversed by the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5; 10 microM). The NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) had an inverse concentration-dependent effect on 5-HT release.

The non-selective nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) at 1 mM increased extracellular 5-HT, although a return to basal levels occurred despite the continued presence of the drug. At 1 mM L-NAME prevented the decrease in 5-HT elicited by NMDA (100 microM) infusion. 7-Nitroindazole (7-NI), a relatively selective neuronal NOS (nNOS) inhibitor, decreased extracellular 5-HT at 100 microM and 1 mM. When 100 microM 7-NI was infused for 60 min prior to NMDA, 5-HT levels were transiently increased above basal before returning to control levels. Following combined application of the two drugs, no decrease in dialysate 5-HT was seen. Our data support a role for NO in modulating both basal and NMDA-evoked changes in 5-HT release in the hippocampus, however, the association appears to be complex. It may be that the recorded changes in 5-HT release are secondary to changes in the release of amino acid transmitters which we have previously found to be dependent on the prevailing extracellular NO concentration.",,Germany,2001,10.1007/s002100000370,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11284445

Recently, we showed that the effects on neurotransmitter contents in different brain regions of laboratory animals are more evident after administration of hypericum extracts containing a higher concentration of flavonoids, thus suggesting that these compounds are important in the antidepressant action of hypericum perforatum. We studied the effects of Ph-50, a hypericum extract standardized to flavonoids (50%) and containing 0.3% hypericin and 4.5% hyperforin on brain serotonin content, norepinephrine and dopamine by a high-performance liquid chromatography method in discrete brain areas (cortex, diencephalon and brainstem) in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of Ph-50 alone or in association with sulpiride (a dopamine receptor antagonist), metergoline (a serotonin receptor antagonist) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA, destroying norepinephrine-containing neurons) using a forced-swimming test in the rat. Hypericum extract (Ph-50; 250-500 mg/kg) with acute oral administration enhanced serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine content in the brain and reduced the immobility time of rats in the forced-swimming test. Sulpiride, metergoline and 6-OH-DA significantly increased the period of immobility in the forced-swimming test for the rats receiving hypericum extract (Ph-50). The results indicate that the neurotransmitters studied could be involved in the anti-immobility effects of hypericum, and suggest that its antidepressant action is probably mediated by serotonergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic system activation.",,Germany,2001,10.1055/s-2001-15180,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11302563

The present study substantiates the role of TNF as a neuromodulator and demonstrates a reciprocally permissive relationship between the biological effects of TNF and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor activation as a mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Immunohistochemical analysis and in situ hybridization reveal that administration of the antidepressant drug desipramine decreases the accumulation of constitutively expressed TNF mRNA in neurons of the rat brain. Superfusion and electrical field stimulation were applied to a series of rat hippocampal brain slices to study the regulation of [(3)H]NE release. Superfusion of hippocampal slices obtained from rats chronically administered the antidepressant drug zimelidine demonstrates that TNF-mediated inhibition of [(3)H]NE release is transformed, such that [(3)H]NE release is potentiated in the presence of TNF, an effect that occurs in association with alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor activation. However, chronic zimelidine administration does not alter stimulation-evoked [(3)H]NE release, whereas chronic desipramine administration increases stimulation-evoked [(3)H]NE release and concomitantly decreases alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptor sensitivity. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that chronic antidepressant drug administration alters alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor-dependent regulation of NE release. Additionally, these data demonstrate that administration of dissimilar antidepressant drugs similarly transform alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptors that are functionally associated with the neuromodulatory effects of TNF, suggesting a possible mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs.",,United States,2001,,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11303058

MDMA use is often associated with dance parties called ""raves"", but its use has increased in all segments of society and around the world. Like amphetamine, MDMA elicits hyperactivity when administered to rodents. Unlike amphetamine, which has effects mediated by the release of dopamine (DA) from nerve terminals, MDMA-induced hyperactivity is thought to be dependent upon the release of 5-hydroxtryptamine (5-HT). However, MDMA elicits large increases in synaptic concentrations of both DA and 5-HT, and the interaction between these neurotransmitters may account for the unique characteristics of the drug. Comparisons between MDMA, the selective DA releaser amphetamine, and the selective 5-HT releaser fenfluramine are used in the present discussion to highlight the ability of MDMA to model the locomotor activation induced by the interaction of DA and 5-HT. Furthermore, this review summarizes evidence to suggest that the influence of 5-HT receptors on behavioral function is dependent upon the specific neurochemical environment evoked by a given drug, specifically discussed here with regard to the interaction between 5-HT and DA systems.",,United States,2001,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11356903

The effectiveness of NIPS was evaluated independently by measuring agonist mediated potentiation of [35S]-guanosine 5'-(gamma-thiotriphosphate) ([35S]-GTPgammaS) binding and [3H]-dopamine uptake. A decrease in E(max) for ligand potentiated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding and a loss of quinpirole potentiated [3H]-dopamine uptake was observed consistent with a NIPS mediated alkylation and functional down-regulation of the dopamine D(2) receptor. This down-regulation was associated with an attenuation of the dose dependent uptake of dopamine in both the striatum and the accumbens. Co-administration of estrogen and NIPS resulted in a further attenuation of dopamine potentiated [35S]-GTPgammaS binding measured in vitro and dopamine uptake measured in vivo. Analysis of the voltammetric profile revealed that clearance and T(50) times were significantly prolonged in animals treated with estrogen and NIPS compared with those treated with NIPS alone. These data are consistent with both a steroid mediated impairment in dopamine autoreceptor/dopamine transporter coupling and an independent action of estrogen at the level of the dopamine transporter.",,United States,2001,10.1016/s0361-9230(01)00472-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11403989

To identify serotoninergic correlates of these altered behaviors, autoradiographic measurements of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin (5-HT) receptors and transporter (5-HTT) were obtained using the radioligands [3H]8-OH-DPAT, [125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]citalopram, respectively. By comparison to wild-type, density of 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged throughout brain in 5-HT1A KOs, and that of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. In contrast, decreases in density of 5-HTT binding were measured in several brain regions of both genotypes. Moreover, 5-HTT binding density was significantly increased in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of the 5-HT1B KOs. Measurements of 5-HT axon length and number of axon varicosities by quantitative 5-HT immunocytochemistry revealed proportional increases in the density of 5-HT innervation in these two regions of 5-HT1B KOs, whereas none of the decreases in 5-HTT binding sites were associated with any such changes. Several conclusions could be drawn from these results: (i) 5-HT1B receptors do not adapt in 5-HT1A KOs, nor do 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. (ii) 5-HTT is down-regulated in several brain regions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B KO mice. (iii) This down-regulation could contribute to the anxious-like phenotype of the 5-HT1A KOs, by reducing 5-HT clearance in several territories of 5-HT innervation. (iv) The 5-HT hyperinnervation in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of 5-HT1B KOs could play a role in their increased aggressiveness, and might also explain their better performance in some cognitive tests. (v) These increases in density of 5-HT innervation provide the first evidence for a negative control of 5-HT neuron growth mediated by 5-HT1B receptors.",,England,2001,10.1046/j.1471-4159.2001.00437.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11483665

In the dual probe studies intra-accumbens perfusion with the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists SKF28293 and pergolide had no effect on ventral pallidal GABA, while both the D1 and D2 receptor antagonists SCH23390 and raclopride increased ventral pallidal GABA release. In contrast, intra-accumbens CCK decreased ventral pallidal GABA release and this was reversed by local perfusion with the CCK2 receptor antagonist PD134308 but not the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718. In a single probe study intra-accumbens neurotensin increased local GABA release, which was strongly potentiated when the peptidase inhibitor phosphodiepryl 08 was perfused together with neurotensin. In addition, the neurotensin receptor antagonist SR48692 counteracted this phosphodiepryl 08 induced potentiated increased in GABA release. Taken together, these findings indicate that mesolimbic dopamine and CCK exert a respective tonic and phasic inhibition of ventral pallidal GABA release while the antipsychotic activity associated with D1 and D2 receptor antagonists may be explained by their ability to increase ventral striopallidal GABA transmission.

Developmental brain research,,"An earlier study from this laboratory found a significant reduction in the density of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal and median raphe and in the B9 complex of postnatal day 5 (PN5) offspring of female rats that consumed ethanol on a chronic basis prior to parturition. In addition, we demonstrated that maternal treatment with the 5-HT(1A) agonist ipsapirone (3 mg/kg) prevented the ethanol-associated reduction in 5-HT neurons. The present investigation examined whether there was a persistent deficit of 5-HT-immunopositive neurons in the dorsal and median raphe of the offspring of ethanol-fed dams. We also evaluated whether a lower ipsapirone dose (1 mg/kg) was protective to developing 5-HT neurons in the offspring of ethanol-fed dams. The offspring of ethanol-fed dams exhibited an apparent lasting reduction in the density of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and median raphe. The density of 5-HT neurons in control offspring was comparable at PN5 and PN19, but at both ages the offspring of ethanol-fed dams had a significant deficit of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and median raphe. The lack of recovery in the density of 5-HT-immunopositive neurons in the offspring of ethanol-fed dams between PN5 and PN19 suggests and that the reduction was long lasting. The protective effects of ipsapirone appeared to be dose dependent. The density of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal and median raphe of PN5 (prior study) and PN19 offspring of ethanol-fed dams that were treated with 3 mg/kg of ipsapirone between gestational day 13 (G13) and G20 was comparable to that of control offspring.

Also studied were the effects of equivalent acute doses of two constituents of HP (with respect to LI 160 extract), hypericin and hyperforin in rats. In acute treatment studies in normal volunteers subjects received 9 tablets of the finished product Jarsin 300 and placebo in the pilot study (unblinded) and in the main study (a double blind, balanced order, cross-over design). Results in normal volunteer studies show that HP caused significant increases of salivary cortisol and plasma growth hormone (GH) whereas it decreased plasma prolactin versus placebo. Plasma hormone levels were associated with a rise in plasma hyperforin but not with hypericin, however no significant correlation was found. In the animal studies, acute treatment with LI 160, hyperforin and hypericin all caused significant increases in plasma corticosterone. This was associated with significant increases in brain cortical tissue 5-HT content. The corticosterone responses were attenuated by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin but not by the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100635. This suggests that the corticosterone responses may be mediated via a 5-HT2 mechanism of action. When sub-chronic and acute treatment using two different doses of LI 160 were compared, plasma corticosterone level were significantly decreased. Thus suggesting a down-regulation or desensitisation of post-synaptic 5-HT2 receptors. Plasma prolactin was significantly reduced by acute treatment with LI 160 and hyperforin treatment but not by hypericin. This was associated with a concomitant rise in brain cortical tissue DA. Both LI 160 and hyperforin treatments decreased the plasma prolactin responses to the DA antagonist, haloperidol, suggesting that this may be associated with a DA-mediated mechanisn of action. When acute and sub-chronic treatments were compared, plasma prolactin responses were increased in the sub-chronically treated animals. The studies when taken together suggest that the LI 160 extract may effect plasma hormonal changes via both 5-HT and DA-mediated mechanisms but do not involve noradrenaline (NA). The data also suggests that hyperforin may be more important than hypericin for effecting these changes following acute treatment.

In addition, dopamine transporter and dopamine receptor densities were measured using autoradiographic techniques, and tyrosine hydroxylase was measured using immunoautoradiographic techniques. Treatment with U-69593 with or without cocaine decreased locomotor activity. When challenged with cocaine after a 5-day treatment period, the effects of cocaine were markedly reduced in rats initially treated with U-69593 compared to vehicle. When U-69593 was administered five times with 3-day intervals, it alone had no effect on locomotor activity but still reduced activity associated with a cocaine injection. After five daily injections, U-69593 decreased dopamine transporter and dopamine D(2) receptor densities and increased tyrosine hydroxylase levels. These changes were not seen after the 3-day interval regimen, even though cocaine-induced activity was greatly reduced. These findings show that the effects associated with daily U-69593 treatment are attenuated if the drug is administered with a greater interval, while maintaining a blockade of cocaine-induced activity.

In rodents, early life exposure to stressful experiences such as social isolation produces a spectrum of symptoms emerging in adult life, which can be restored by antipsychotic drugs. The present series of experiments sought to investigate the effect of clozapine (5-10 mg/kg s.c.), olanzapine (5 mg/kg s.c.), and haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) on dopamine (DA) and amino acids in the prelimbic/infralimbic subregion of the mPFC in group- and isolation-reared rats. Rats reared in isolation showed significant and robust deficits in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle. In group-reared animals, both clozapine and olanzapine produced a significant increase in DA outflow in the mPFC. Isolation-reared rats showed a significant increase in responsiveness to both atypical antipsychotics compared with group-reared animals. In contrast, the administration of haloperidol failed to modify dialysate DA levels in mPFC in either group- or isolation-reared animals. The results also show a positive relationship between the potency of the tested antipsychotics to increase the release of DA in the mPFC and their respective affinities for 5-HT1A relative to DA D2 or D3 receptors. Finally, isolation-reared rats showed enhanced neurochemical responses to the highest dose of clozapine as indexed by alanine, aspartate, GABA, glutamine, glutamate, histidine, and tyrosine. The increased DA responsiveness to the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine may explain, at least in part, clozapine- and olanzapine-induced reversal of some of the major behavioral components of the social isolation syndrome, namely hyperactivity and attention deficit.",,Germany,2001,10.1007/s002130100760,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11549234

In contrast, local bilateral microinjections of the NMDA receptor antagonist, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (500 and 1000 pmol), reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, both reflex-evoked responses. The facilitatory effect of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine upon these reflex-evoked bradycardiac responses was prevented by prior local microinjection of low doses of either the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (10 pmol), or 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (100 pmol), which, on their own, did not affect the reflex-associated bradycardia. These data suggest that 5-HT2 receptors within the nucleus tractus solitarius participate in a facilitatory modulation of the reflex control of heart rate, probably through functional interactions with local NMDA receptors.",,Netherlands,2001,10.1016/S1566-0702(01)00318-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11570703

Cellular compartmentalization of T(3) was studied by distinguishing T(3) activity associated with the plasma membrane from that in the cytosol or incorporated in the cell nucleus. T(3) and T(4) uptake displayed similar temperature dependencies which, in magnitude, differed from that of rT(3) uptake. T(3) uptake was Na(+ )independent, and sensitive to oligomycin and monodansylcadaverine (42-49% and 25% inhibition of 15-min cellular uptake respectively). Furthermore, T(3) uptake could be inhibited by tryptophan (20%) and tyrosine (12%), while 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-carboxylic acid had no effect. Co-incubation with tryptophan and oligomycin resulted in an additive inhibition of T(3) uptake (77%). We therefore conclude that (i) T(3) uptake is energy dependent, (ii) receptor-mediated endocytosis may be involved and (iii) the aromatic amino acid transport system T may play a role, while system L is not involved in T(3) transport in cardiomyocytes. Co-incubation with unlabeled iodothyronines showed that 3,3'-di-iodothyronine and T(3) itself were the most effective inhibitors of T(3) uptake (30% and 36% inhibition of 15-min cellular uptake respectively). At 15-min incubation time, 38% of the total cell-associated T(3) was present in the cytosol and nucleus, and 62% remained associated to the plasma membrane. Unidirectional uptake rates did not saturate over a free T(3) concentration range up to 3.9 microM. We have concluded that T(3) uptake in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes occurs by an energy- and temperature-dependent mechanism that may include endocytosis and amino acid transport system T, and is not sensitive to the Na(+) gradient.

Results showed that SR48968 (0.3-10 mg/kg i.p.) produced antidepressant-like activity because it reduced immobility in the forced swimming test in both mice and rats, and decreased the amount of maternal separation-induced vocalizations in guinea pig pups. This latter effect appears to involve a reduction of stress-induced substance P release because SR48968 reduced the separation-induced increase in the number of neurons displaying neurokinin-1 receptor internalization in the amygdala. Furthermore, SR48968 increased the expression of the cAMP response-element binding protein mRNA in the rat hippocampus after repeated (1 mg/kg i.p., 21 days), but not acute administration. Finally, neuronal firing of the locus coeruleus (LC) and noradrenergic (NE) release in the prefrontal cortex both elicited by an uncontrollable stressor or an intraventricular administration of CRF were reduced by SR48968 (0.3-1 mg/kg i.p.). The finding that SR48968 (1 mg/kg i.p.) blocked the cortical release of NE induced by an intra-LC infusion of the preferential NK2 receptor agonist neurokinin A suggested the presence of NK2 receptors in this latter region. Importantly, SR48965 (1-10 mg/kg i.p.), the optical antipode of SR48968, which is devoid of affinity for the NK2 receptor, was inactive in all the models used.

In contrast to the well-characterized actions of dopamine on striatal neurons, the functional role of the dopamine innervation of globus pallidus is less well understood. Previous research showed that systemic administration of either a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist or combined dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists induces Fos, the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos, in neurons of globus pallidus [Ruskin and Marshall (1997) Neuroscience 81, 79-92]. To determine whether the ability of the D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride, to induce Fos in rat pallidal neurons is mediated by D2-like receptors in striatum or globus pallidus, intrastriatal or intrapallidal sulpiride infusions were conducted. The diffusion of intrastriatal sulpiride was estimated by measuring this antagonist's competition for N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ)-induced D2 receptor inactivation. The phenotype of the striatal neurons expressing Fos after intrastriatal infusion was assessed by combining Fos immunocytochemistry with D2 receptor mRNA in situ hybridization. Intrastriatal infusions of (-)-sulpiride (10-200 ng) dose-dependently increased the number of striatal cells expressing Fos; and the Fos-immunoreactive striatal cells were D2 receptor mRNA-expressing, the same population in which systemic D2 receptor antagonists induce Fos. Intrastriatal infusions of high (5 microg), but not low (10-200 ng), (-)-sulpiride doses also induced Fos in globus pallidus cells but the sulpiride appeared to spread to the globus pallidus. Direct intrapallidal infusions of (-)-sulpiride (50-100 ng) dose-dependently induced Fos in globus pallidus with minimal influence on striatum or other basal ganglia structures. Using sensitive in situ hybridization conditions, prominent labeling of D2 receptor mRNA was evident in globus pallidus. D2 receptor mRNA was densest in a lateral 200 microm wide band that follows the curvature of the pallidal/striatal boundary. Cellular analysis revealed silver clusters associated with D2 receptor mRNA labeling over globus pallidus neurons that were immunoreactive for neuron-specific nuclear protein. These results strongly suggest that the dopaminergic innervation of globus pallidus, acting through D2-like receptors internal to this structure, can control gene expression in pallidal neurons.",,United States,2001,10.1016/s0306-4522(01)00180-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11672604

Rimcazole binds to both of these targets and also attenuates cocaine-induced locomotor activity and sensitization. To further characterize the mechanism(s) underlying the attenuation of cocaine-induced convulsions and lethality, rimcazole and three analogs (SH3/24, SH2/21, SH1/57), with a range of affinities for dopamine transporters and sigma receptors, were evaluated. The highly selective and potent sigma receptor ligand LR176 was used as a reference. Competition binding studies confirmed that the rank order of the compounds at dopamine transporters vs. sigma receptors differed, thus enabling a correlation between the relative anti-cocaine activities of the compounds in behavioral studies and their affinities for dopamine transporters vs. sigma receptors. In behavioral studies, male Swiss Webster mice were pre-treated with one of the compounds (0-60 mg/kg, i.p.), then challenged 15 min later with either a convulsive (60 mg/kg, i.p.) or lethal (125 mg/kg, i.p.) dose of cocaine. When the compounds were ranked according to their protective effect, there was a significant correlation between their anticonvulsant actions and their affinities for sigma receptors, but not dopamine transporters. Although the rimcazole analogs were ineffective against the lethal effects of cocaine, the selective sigma receptor ligand LR176 provided significant protection. These data thus suggest that sigma receptors may mediate some of the toxic effects associated with cocaine and that sigma receptor antagonists may be developed as pharmacotherapeutic agents for this application.",,England,2001,10.1016/s0028-3908(01)00116-2,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11684152

Developmental brain research,,"Previously, this laboratory demonstrated that the development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons and S100B-immunopositive glia proximal to these neurons is impaired in the offspring of ethanol-fed rats. However, maternal treatment with a 5-HT(1A) agonist, e.g., buspirone or ipsapirone, between gestational days 13 and 20 prevented most of the ethanol-associated changes to developing 5-HT neurons and S100B-immunopositive glia in offspring. The present in vitro studies examined the hypothesis that the protective effects of a 5-HT(1A) agonist on ethanol-exposed, developing 5-HT neurons are mediated in part by astrocyte-produced factors such as S100B. Primary cultures of fetal 5-HT neurons were maintained in conditioned medium (CM) that was obtained from ethanol- and buspirone-treated astrocytes. In order to assess the potential contribution of S100B to the protective effects of buspirone, a mouse monoclonal antibody to S100B was added to the CM to block the biological effects of this protein. These studies demonstrated that CM, obtained from ethanol-treated astrocytes, was unable to support normal development of 5-HT neurons; there was a significant reduction in the number of 5-HT neurons/well. However, CM that was obtained from astrocytes that were co-treated with buspirone and ethanol prevented the ethanol-associated reduction, and the protective effects of buspirone required S100B. We also investigated whether exogenous S100B could protect 5-HT neurons from damage caused by direct exposure to ethanol. Direct exposure of fetal brainstem neurons to ethanol in chemically-defined medium was associated with a significant reduction in the number of 5-HT immunopositive neurons/well. However, exogenous S100B protected 5-HT neurons from the ethanol-associated reduction. Our observations suggest that the protective effects of buspirone on ethanol-exposed, developing 5-HT neurons are mediated in part by the astrocyte-produced factor S100B.",,Netherlands,2001,10.1016/s0165-3806(01)00240-1,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11718831

It is possible that this genetically-based difference in sensitivity to the hypothermic effects of the 5-HT1A agonist is associated with a change in other behaviours modulated by 5-HT neurotransmission. The present study examined the acoustic startle response, the classically conditioned enhancement of startle, and the effects of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone treatments on these measures, in HDS and LDS rats. On four test sessions, HDS and LDS rats were exposed to 20 acoustic startle stimuli (115 dB; 40 ms in duration). For each test session, 10 trials were presented in the dark (Noise Alone trials) and 10 were presented at the end of a 3500 ms presentation of a 15 W signal light (Light + Noise trials). LDS rats exhibited greater startle amplitude than did HDS rats on Noise Alone trials. Initially, there was no difference in startle amplitude on the Light + Noise versus Noise Alone trials in either LDS or HDS rats. By the end of the first test session, however, and continuing throughout the remainder of the four test sessions, startle amplitude on the Light + Noise trials was significantly greater than in the Noise Alone trials. The magnitude of this startle-potentiated startle (SPS) effect did not differ in HDS versus LDS rats. SPS testing was continued for three additional sessions; in these sessions the effects of acute treatment with the 8-OH-DPAT (125 microg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)), the novel anxiolytic buspirone (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) or vehicle (distilled water) were determined. Both 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone treatment increased baseline (Noise Alone) startle amplitude in LDS rats but not in HDS rats. With respect to the conditioned enhancement of startle, buspirone reduced the SPS effect in both HDS and LDS rats, whereas 8-OH-DPAT did not change the conditioned enhancement effect in either rat line. These findings suggest that the selective breeding for differences in 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia has resulted in changes in other behaviours and also changes in the response to 5-HT1A agonist treatment. Moreover, these findings are consistent with the hypotheses that: (a) 5-HT1A agonist actions underlie the buspirone-induced and 8-OH-DPAT-induced increases in Noise Alone startle amplitude; whereas (b) the buspirone-induced reduction in potentiated startle is not the result of 5-HT1A agonist actions of this compound.",,England,2001,10.1097/00008877-200111000-00012,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11742145

Without exception, these inhibitors of serotonin transport contain an amine nitrogen in their structure. We previously demonstrated that novel compounds without an amine nitrogen in their structure (non-amines), blocked dopamine transport in cells transfected with the human dopamine transporter. The present study investigated whether, in the absence of an amine nitrogen, certain non-amines bind selectively to the SERT and block the transport of serotonin. At 10 microM concentration, select non-amines displayed no, or little, affinity for 9 serotonin, 5 dopamine, 7 adrenergic, 5 muscarinic cholinergic, 3 opiate and histamine receptors. The affinities of non-amines for [(3)H]citalopram binding sites on the SERT and their potencies for blocking [(3)H]serotonin transport were measured in cloned human SERT stably or transiently expressed in HEK-293. Whether oxa- or carba-based, non-amines bound to [(3)H]citalopram-labeled sites and blocked [(3)H]serotonin transport in the low nanomolar range, at values equal to or higher than those of some conventional antidepressants. A non-amine, O-1809, was 99-fold more selective for the serotonin over the dopamine transporter. As substituents on the aromatic ring of non-amines confer high affinity for the SERT, we investigated the hypothesis that aromatic-aromatic interactions may contribute significantly to non-amine/transporter association. A SERT mutant was produced in which a highly conserved aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine 548, was replaced by an alanine (F548A). Although the affinities of several non-amines were unchanged in the mutant SERT, the affinity of imipramine was decreased, revealing possible differences in amine and non-amine binding domains on the SERT. The similar affinities of non-amines and conventional antidepressant drugs for the SERT support the view that an amine nitrogen is not essential for drugs to block serotonin transport with high affinity.

Indeed, serotonin may be tied to the evolution of life itself, particularly through the role of tryptophan, its precursor molecule. Tryptophan is an indole-based, essential amino acid which is unique in its light-absorbing properties. In plants, tryptophan-based compounds capture light energy for use in metabolism of glucose and the generation of oxygen and reduced cofactors. Tryptophan, oxygen, and reduced cofactors combine to form serotonin. Serotonin-like molecules direct the growth of light-capturing structures towards the source of light. This morphogenic property also occurs in animal cells, in which serotonin alters the cytoskeleton of cells and thus influences the formation of contacts. In addition, serotonin regulates cell proliferation, migration and maturation in a variety of cell types, including lung, kidney, endothelial cells, mast cells, neurons and astrocytes). In brain, serotonin has interactions with seven families of receptors, numbering at least 14 distinct proteins. Of these, two receptors are important for the purposes of this review. These are the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, which in fact have opposing functions in a variety of cellular and behavioral processes. The 5-HT1A receptor develops early in the CNS and is associated with secretion of S-100beta from astrocytes and reduction of c-AMP levels in neurons. These actions provide intracellular stability for the cytoskeleton and result in cell differentiation and cessation of proliferation. Clinically, 5-HT1A receptor drugs decrease brain activity and act as anxiolytics. The 5-HT2A receptor develops more slowly and is associated with glycogenolysis in astrocytes and increased Ca(++) availability in neurons. These actions destabilize the internal cytoskeleton and result in cell proliferation, synaptogenesis, and apoptosis. In humans, 5-HT2A receptor drugs produce hallucinations. The dynamic interactions between the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and the cytoskeleton may provide important insights into the etiology of brain disorders and provide novel strategies for their treatment.",,United States,2001,10.1016/s0361-9230(01)00614-1,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11750787

The neuronal activity of the BLA, and BLA-mediated affective behaviors, are driven by sensory stimuli transmitted in part from sensory association cortical regions. These same behaviors may be regulated by prefrontal cortical (PFC) inputs to the BLA. However, it is unclear how two sets of glutamatergic inputs to the BLA can impose opposing actions on BLA-mediated behaviors; specifically, it is unclear how PFC inputs exert inhibitory actions over BLA projection neurons. Dopamine (DA) receptor activation enhances BLA-mediated behaviors. Although we have demonstrated that DA suppresses medial PFC inputs to the BLA and enhances sensory cortical inputs, the precise cellular mechanisms for its actions are unknown. In this study we use in vivo intracellular recordings to determine the means by which glutamatergic inputs from the PFC inhibit BLA projection neurons, contrast that with glutamatergic inputs from the association sensory cortex (Te3) that drive BLA projection neurons, and examine the effects of DA receptor activation on neuronal excitability, spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (PSPs), and PFC-evoked PSPs. We found that PFC stimulation inhibits BLA projection neurons by three mechanisms: chloride-mediated hyperpolarization, a persistent decrease in neuronal input resistance, and shunting of PSPs; all effects are possibly attributable to recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. DA receptor activation enhanced neuronal input resistance by a postsynaptic mechanism (via DA D2 receptors), suppressed spontaneously occurring and PFC-evoked PSPs (via DA D1 receptors), and enhanced Te3-evoked PSPs.",,United States,2002,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.22-01-00324.2002,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11756516

Yet, the mechanistic role of serotonin in carcinoid heart disease is poorly understood. We postulated that serotonin has a direct mitogenic effect on cardiac valvular subendocardial cells, and that this effect is mediated by serotonin receptors. METHODS: The dose-dependent proliferative effects of serotonin (10(-8) to 10(-4)M) on cultured porcine aortic valve cells via a [3H]thymidine assay were determined in vitro. Serotonin receptor antagonist studies in culture were also performed using methiotepin, a 5HT1b antagonist, and ketanserin, a 5HT2 receptor antagonist, to determine the mechanism of serotonin action. The ex-vivo proliferation level in human carcinoid (n = 26) and normal valves (n = 10) was compared using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining, a marker for proliferation. Identification and localization of specific 5HT receptor was assessed by immunostaining for serotonin receptors in the valves. RESULTS: Serotonin increased valvular proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner (10-fold increase) (p <0.001), and this mitogenic effect was inhibited by methiotepin but not ketanserin. In human carcinoid heart valves the level of proliferation was 35-fold higher than in normal human valves (p <0.001). 5HT1b receptors were found only in the carcinoid valves, and not in the normal valves. CONCLUSION: Serotonin is a powerful mitogen for valvular subendocardial cells. The mitogenic effect is at least partly mediated via 5HT1b receptors. Subendothelial cell proliferation is significantly elevated in human carcinoid valves in vivo. The data suggest a mechanism whereby serotonin may contribute to valvular proliferation in carcinoid heart disease.",,England,2001,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11767194

SCLC cell lines express a Raf-1-dependent mitogenic signal transduction pathway, which is thought to transduce the mitogenic signals initiated by neuropeptide autocrine growth factors. Recent studies have identified the tobacco-specific carcinogenic nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) as a site-selective high-affinity agonist for the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR), which regulates the growth of a significant subset of SCLC in vitro by stimulating the release of the autocrine growth factor serotonin. The purpose of this study was to identify signaling events initiated by binding of NNK to the alpha7 nAChR. DESIGN: We have used a human SCLC cell line and fetal hamster pulmonary neuroendocrine cells with in vitro kinase activation assays and western blots to assess the levels of expression and activation of Raf-1, MAPK and c-myc to address this issue. RESULTS: Our data show that NNK activates the Raf-1, MAP kinase pathway, resulting in phosphorylation of c-myc. The activation of this signal transduction pathway by NNK was inhibited by the site-selective antagonist for the alpha7 nAChR alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) or by the serotonin reuptake inhibitor imipramine, suggesting that the responses to NNK were mediated by nicotinic receptor-initiated release of serotonin. Accordingly, NNK-induced 5-HT release was blocked by alpha-BTX while NNK-induced DNA synthesis was inhibited by alpha-BTX, imipramine, the PKC inhibitor sphingosine or the MEK inhibitor PD98059. SCLC cells demonstrated high basal levels of 5-HT release, DNA synthesis, and over-expressed Raf-1 and MAPK protein suggesting the constitutive activation of an upstream regulator such as the alpha7 nAChR. CONCLUSION: Our findings link, for the first time, the stimulation of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by a cancer-causing agent with the activation of a Raf-1/MAPK/c-myc signaling pathway. Furthermore, our data suggest that serotonin uptake inhibitors may protect against the development or be useful in the clinical management of SCLC.",,Germany,2001,10.1007/s004320100289,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11768610

However, moderate success has been achieved when sensitive animal models and drug challenge have been used together. OBJECTIVE: The present study used a repeated-acquisition technique and dose-effect determinations before, during and after neurotoxic MDMA exposure to characterize the effects of serotonergic drugs on learning, and to determine if MDMA-induced serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxicity is associated with learning deficits as measured by changes in response rate or the percentage of errors. METHOD: The effects of various serotonergic drugs were characterized in six squirrel monkeys responding under a repeated-acquisition procedure before and after neurotoxic dose regimens of MDMA. Specifically, cumulative dose-effect curves for m-CPP (0.032-1 mg/kg), fenfluramine (0.1-3.2 mg/kg) and triazolam (0.0032-0.1 mg/kg) were obtained prior to MDMA administration, with the latter drug serving as a non-5-HT control. RESULTS: In general, all of the drugs tested decreased overall response rate as the cumulative dose increased, whereas only triazolam markedly increased the percentage of errors. MDMA treatment produced significant (80-99%) decreases in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA axonal markers, but did not lead to changes in either dependent measure of responding or shifts in the dose-effect curves obtained during pharmacological challenges with m-CPP, fenfluramine or triazolam.

Intravenous administration of nicotine caused a dose-dependent increase in firing rate and percentage of spikes fired in bursts of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons. However, this activation was preceded by an instantaneous but short-lasting inhibition of the firing rate. The excitation of dopamine neurons by nicotine (1.5-400 microg/kg i.v.) was antagonized and even reversed into an inhibitory response by elevated levels (four-fold) of the endogenous glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid, as induced by a potent inhibitor of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (PNU 156561A, 40 mg/kg, i.v., 5-9 h). The antagonistic action induced by PNU 156561A pretreatment was prevented by administration of D-cycloserine (128 mg/kg, i.v., 5 min). Administration of the GABA(B)-receptor antagonist CGP 35348 (200 mg/kg, i.v., 3 min) facilitated the nicotine-induced increase in burst firing activity of dopamine neurons and antagonized the short-lasting decrease in firing rate by nicotine. The results of the present study show that nicotine produces both inhibition and excitation of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons, actions that appear to be related to the release of GABA and glutamate, respectively. Whereas the excitatory action of nicotine may be associated with motivational processes underlying learning and cognitive behavior, the inhibitory action of the drug may play a more prominent role in the situation of a profound dysregulation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and may help to explain the high prevalence of tobacco-smoking in schizophrenics.",,United States,2002,10.1002/syn.10044,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11835517

The accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) after decarboxylase inhibition was used as a measure of the rate of tryptophan and tyrosine hydroxylation in vivo. Acute morphine (3-100 mg/kg, 1 h) increased the synthesis of 5-HTP/5-HT in various brain regions (15%-35%) and that of DOPA/dopamine (DA) in striatum (28%-63%), but decreased the synthesis of DOPA/noradrenaline (NA) in hippocampus and cortex (20%-33%). Naloxone (2-60 mg/kg, 1 h) did not alter the synthesis of 5-HTP or DOPA in brain. Tolerance to the inhibitory effect of morphine on DOPA/NA synthesis and a sensitization to its stimulatory effects on DOPA/DA and 5-HTP/5-HT synthesis were observed after chronic morphine and/or in morphine-withdrawn rats. In morphine-dependent rats (tolerant and withdrawn states) the inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1A agonists 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone (0.1 mg/kg, 1 h), and that of the alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine (0.1 mg/kg, 1 h), on the synthesis of 5-HTP/5-HT were potentiated (25%-50%).

In morphine-dependent rats (tolerant state), the inhibitory effects of clonidine on the synthesis of DOPA/NA (hippocampus, hypothalamus) and DOPA/DA (striatum) also were potentiated (35%-55%).

Indeed, given that 5-HT(4) receptors indirectly modulate nigrostriatal DA neuron activity, we hypothesized that these receptors would regulate nigrostriatal DA transmission in the basal ganglia, and consequently, associated motor responses. Stereotypy was induced either by an acute administration of apomorphine (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg sc), or by a single morphine administration (15 mg/kg sc) in chronically morphine-treated (15 mg/kg sc, twice daily for 10 days) rats. Catalepsy was induced by the typical neuroleptic haloperidol (HAL; 1 mg/kg sc). The selective 5-HT(4) antagonist, GR 125487 (1 mg/kg ip), modified neither apomorphine- nor morphine-induced stereotypy. HAL-induced catalepsy, while reduced by the systemic administration of the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg sc), was insensitive to GR 125487, systemically (1, 3, 10 mg/kg ip) or locally (20 and 40 nmol/20 microl) administered into the third ventricle. Also, HAL-induced catalepsy was not affected by the selective 5-HT(4) antagonist GR 113808 (3 mg/kg ip).

Because serotonin (5-HT) is involved in mood regulation, and MAO-A is responsible for the catabolism of 5-HT, we investigated 5-HT mechanisms in knock-out mice (2-month-old) lacking MAO-A, using microdialysis, electrophysiological, autoradiographic and molecular biology approaches. Compared to paired wild-type mice, basal extracellular 5-HT levels were increased in ventral hippocampus (+202%), frontal cortex (+96%) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN, +147%) of MAO-A mutant mice. Conversely, spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the DRN (recorded under chloral hydrate anaesthesia) was approximately 40% lower in mutants. Acute 5-HT reuptake blockade by citalopram (0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg i.v.) produced a much larger increase in extracellular 5-HT levels (by approximately 4 fold) and decrease in DRN neuronal firing (with a approximately 4.5 fold decrease in the drug's ED50) in MAO-A knock-out mice, which expressed lower levels of the 5-HT transporter throughout the brain (-13 to -34% compared to wild-type levels). The potency of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT to produce hypothermia and to reduce the firing of DRN serotoninergic neurons was significantly less in the mutants, indicating a desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. This was associated with a decreased autoradiographic labelling of these receptors (-27%) in the DRN. Altogether, these data indicate that, in MAO-A knock-out mice, the enhancement of extracellular 5-HT levels induces a down-regulation of the 5-HT transporter, and a desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors which allows the maintenance of tonic activity of 5-HT neurons in the DRN.",,France,2002,10.1046/j.1460-9568.2002.01917.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-11906526

The chronic oral administration of OPC-14523 attenuated age-associated impairments of learning acquisition in the water maze and in the conditioned active-avoidance response test. OPC-14523 did not alter basal locomotion or inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity at concentrations up to 100 microM and, unlike AChE inhibitors, did not cause peripheral cholinomimetic responses. ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus of freely moving rats increased after oral delivery of OPC-14523 and after local delivery of OPC-14523 into the hippocampus. The increases in hippocampal ACh release were blocked by the sigma receptor antagonist NE-100 (N,N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)-phenyl]-ethylamine).

Early studies indicated that 5-HT is present in the oocyte, where it appears to function as a regulator of cell cleavage. Later, it has a significant role during gastrulation, during which there are significant areas of 5-HT uptake in the primitive streak. Subsequently, in association with neurulation, 5-HT uptake is seen in the floor plate of the developing neural tube. During neural crest formation and branchial arch formation, 5-HT has been demonstrated to facilitate cell migration and stimulate cell differentiation. During morphogenesis of the craniofacial structures, 5-HT stimulates dental development and may aid in cusp formation. All of the most commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs inhibit serotonin uptake, yet they do not appear to cause major craniofacial malformations in vivo. Given the wide spectrum of effects that 5-HT has during development, it is difficult to understand why these anti-depressants are not major teratogens. Redundancy within the system may allow receptor and uptake pathways to function normally even with lower than normal levels of circulating serotonin. Serotonin-binding proteins, that are expressed in most craniofacial regions at critical times during craniofacial development, may have a buffering capacity that maintains adequate 5-HT tissue concentrations over a wide range of 5-HT serum concentrations. Dental development appears to be particularly sensitive to even small fluctuations in concentrations of 5-HT. Therefore, it may be that children of patients who have received selective serotonergic re-uptake inhibitors (such as Prozac and Zoloft) or the less selective tricyclic anti-depressant drugs (such as Elavil) would be at a higher risk for developmental dental defects such as anodontia and hypodontia. In this review, the evidence supporting a role for 5-HT during mammalian craniofacial development is discussed.

Delineation of mechanisms by which stress contributes to these processes is fundamental to understanding the disease process and for improving outcome. In this article, evidence is reviewed to indicate that many central aspects of stress response, including activation of the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and dopamine neurotransmission, are modulated, and in some cases mediated, by glutamate neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It is suggested that activation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the PFC presents a common mechanism by which stress influences normal and abnormal processes that sustain affect and cognition. Although monoamines, in particular dopamine, have been considered the major culprits in the adverse effects of stress in disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia, it is likely that in a vulnerable brain with an underlying PFC pathophysiology, abnormal stress-activated monoaminergic neurotransmission is secondary to anomalies in cortical glutamate neurotransmission. Thus, understanding the contribution of glutamate-mediated processes to stress response through the use of experimental models that involve disrupted PFC function can provide insights to the fundamental pathophysiology of stress-sensitive psychiatric disorders and lead to novel strategies for treatment and prevention.",,United States,2002,10.1016/s0006-3223(01)01362-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12007451

Molecular brain research,,"Because of the possible interaction between adenosine receptors and dopaminergic functions, the compound acting on the specific adenosine receptor subtype may be a candidate for novel antipsychotic drugs. To elucidate the antipsychotic potential of the selective adenosine A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), we examined herein the effects of CPA on phencyclidine (PCP)-induced behavior and expression of the immediate-early genes (IEGs), arc, c-fos and jun B, in the discrete brain regions of rats. PCP (7.5 mg/kg, s.c.) increased locomotor activity and head weaving in rats and this effect was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with CPA (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). PCP increased the mRNA levels of c-fos and jun B in the medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and posterior cingulate cortex, while leaving the striatum and hippocampus unaffected. CPA pretreatment significantly attenuated the PCP-induced increase in c-fos mRNA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. CPA also significantly attenuated the PCP-induced arc expression in the medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. When administered alone, CPA decreased the mRNA levels of all IEGs examined in the nucleus accumbens, but not in other brain regions. Based on the ability of CPA to inhibit PCP-induced hyperlocomotion and its interaction with neural systems in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens, the present results provide further evidence for a significant antipsychotic effect of the adenosine A(1) receptor agonist.",,Netherlands,2002,10.1016/s0169-328x(02)00136-5,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12008016

The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LAT) is necessary for the emotional memory formation in this paradigm. Enhanced neuronal firing in LAT to conditioned stimuli emerge in parallel with the behavioural changes and are dependent on local dopamine. To study the changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic drive that contribute to the pavlovian conditioning process, here we used in vivo intracellular recordings to examine LAT neurons during pavlovian conditioning in rats. We found that repeated pairings of an odour with a foot-shock resulted in enhanced post-synaptic potential (PSP) responses to the odour and increased neuronal excitability. However, a non-paired odour displayed PSP decrement. The dopamine antagonist haloperidol blocked the PSP enhancement and associated increased neuronal excitability, without reversing previous conditioning. These results demonstrate that conditioning and habituation processes produce opposite effects on LAT neurons and that dopamine is important in these events, consistent with its role in emotional memory formation.",,England,2002,10.1038/417282a,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12015602

OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated whether neonatal dopamine lesions lead to supersensitivity to the stimulant effects of two NMDA antagonists, phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats, given dopamine or sham lesions on day 3 of life, were tested as adults for locomotor changes following treatment with NMDA antagonists. RESULTS: Lesioned rats were more sensitive to the stimulant effects of PCP and ketamine than controls. Enhanced sensitivity to PCP emerged in the male lesioned animals following a brief priming regimen with a D(1)-dopamine receptor agonist. Sensitization was also induced by repeated treatments with PCP (5 mg/kg), given at weekly intervals across 4 weeks, with progressive increases in activity significantly enhanced in the lesioned animals. Sensitization to PCP was still evident 3 weeks following chronic PCP treatment. The high rates of PCP-induced locomotion in the lesioned animals were not attenuated by pretreatment with a dopamine antagonist selective for the D(1)-dopamine receptor site (SCH-23390, 0.3 mg/kg) or with haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), in comparison to controls. Olanzapine (5 mg/kg), an atypical antipsychotic, significantly reduced the response to PCP (5 mg/kg) in lesioned and control animals.

Medline-based search on melatonin-dopamine interactions in mammals. Melatonin. the hormone produced by the pineal gland at night. influences circadian and seasonal rhythms, most notably the sleep-wake cycle and seasonal reproduction. The neurochemical basis of these activities is not understood yet. Inhibition of dopamine release by melatonin has been demonstrated in specific areas of the mammalian central nervous system (hypothalamus, hippocampus, medulla-pons, and retina). Antidopaminergic activities of melatonin have been demonstrated in the striatum. Dopaminergic transmission has a pivotal role in circadian entrainment of the fetus, in coordination of body movement and reproduction. Recent findings indicate that melatonin may modulate dopaminergic pathways involved in movement disorders in humans. In Parkinson patients melatonin may, on the one hand, exacerbate symptoms (because of its putative interference with dopamine release) and, on the other, protect against neurodegeneration (by virtue of its antioxidant properties and its effects on mitochondrial activity). Melatonin appears to be effective in the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. a severe movement disorder associated with long-term blockade of the postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor by antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenic patients. The interaction of melatonin with the dopaminergic system may play a significant role in the nonphotic and photic entrainment of the biological clock as well as in the fine-tuning of motor coordination in the striatum. These interactions and the antioxidant nature of melatonin may be beneficial in the treatment of dopamine-related disorders.",,United States,2001,10.1023/a:1015187601628,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12043836

In saline-treated rats as well as in acute ethanol (2 g/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.), 2 h)- and chronic ethanol (2 g/kg for 7 days)-treated rats, a low dose of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., 1 h) did not decrease the synthesis of 5-HTP in brain (except modestly in striatum; 20% after the chronic treatment) or that of DOPA in striatum.

The inhibitory effect of dopamin on Na+-K+-ATPase activity was completely abolished by either D1- or D2-like receptor antagonists and mimicked by D1- and D2-like receptor agonists SKF-38393 and quinerolane, respectively. Blockade of basolateral K+ channels with BaCl2 (1 mM) or glibenclamide (10 microM), but not apamin (1 microM), totally prevented the inhibitory effects of quinerolane. The K+ channel opener pinacidil decreased Na+-K+-ATPase activity. The inhibitory effect of quinerolane on Na+-K+- ATPase activity was abolished by pretreatment of opossum kidney cells with pertussis toxin (PTX). Quinerolane increased I(K) across the basolateral membrane in a concentration-dependent manner; this effect was abolished by pretreatment with PTX, S-sulpiride, and glibenclamide. SKF-38393 did not change I(K). Both H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor) and chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) failed to prevent the stimulatory effect of quinerolane on I(K). The stimulation of the D2-like receptor was associated with a rapid hyperpolarizing effect, whereas D1-like receptor activation was accompanied by increases in cell membrane potential. It is concluded that stimulation of D2-like receptors leads to inhibition of Na+-K+-ATPase activity and hyperpolarization; both effects are associated with the opening of K+ channels.",,United States,2002,10.1152/ajprenal.00244.2001,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12060593

(+)-PD 128907 (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) significantly decreased extracellular dopamine.

However, the mechanism underlying the secretion of 5-HT from pinealocytes is unknown. In this study, we show that NE-evoked release of 5-HT is largely dependent on Ca2+ in rat pinealocytes in culture. Omission of Ca2+ from the medium and incubation of pineal cells with EGTA-tetraacetoxymethyl-ester inhibited by 59 and 97% the NE-evoked 5-HT release, respectively. Phenylephrine also triggered the Ca2+-dependent release of 5-HT, which was blocked by phentolamine, an alpha antagonist, but not by propranolol, a beta antagonist. Botulinum neurotoxin type E cleaved 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein and inhibited by 50% of the NE-evoked 5-HT release. Bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase, and reserpine and tetrabenazine, inhibitors of vesicular monoamine transporter, all decreased the storage of vesicular 5-HT followed by inhibition of the NE-evoked 5-HT release. Agents that trigger L-glutamte exocytosis such as acetylcholine did not trigger any Ca2+-dependent 5-HT release. Vice versa neither NE nor phenylephrine caused synaptic-like microvesicle-mediated l-glutamate exocytosis.

Antinociceptive effects were evaluated by using formalin tests with rats. Antidepressants acting as potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake (nisoxetine, nortriptyline, and maprotiline) or inhibiting reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) (imipramine and milnacipran) induced dose-dependent antinociception. Simultaneous intraperitoneal administration of antidepressants and either prazosin (alpha(1) antagonist) or ketanserin (5-HT(2) antagonist) significantly antagonized antinociceptive effects. Fluvoxamine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) induced antinociception less potently than other antidepressants and was significantly antagonized by ketanserin, but not prazosin. Ondansetron (5-HT(3) antagonist) significantly antagonized antinociception by 10 mg/kg of imipramine. In contrast, SDZ-205,557 (5-HT(4) antagonist) markedly enhanced antinociception by small-dose (2.5 mg/kg) imipramine. Imipramine-induced antinociception was significantly antagonized by intracerebroventricular administration of prazosin or ketanserin, but not by yohimbine (alpha(2) antagonist) or ondansetron, and was significantly enhanced by intracerebroventricularly administered SDZ-205,557. These findings suggest that alpha(1) adrenoceptors and 5-HT(2) receptors in the brain are involved in antidepressant-induced antinociception. In addition, the results suggested functional interactions between noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons as mechanisms for antidepressant-induced antinociception.

We thus determined if IL-2 treatment increases the expression of climbing behavior, a behavior that is linked with dopamine D-1 and/or D-2 receptors and one used to test the efficacy of neuroleptics. IL-2 treatment (5-daily i.p. injections; 0.4 microg/BALB/c mouse) induced a marked 2-fold increase in climbing scores; a single injection had no effect.

In addition, 10 mg/kg 2-(2,3-dihydro-2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxin-2-yl)4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazole (RX 821002), an alpha(2A/D)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and 20 mg/kg haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, also block alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal neurons. No effects were seen in alcohol-induced c-Fos after the pretreatment of 20 mg/kg propranolol (beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), 10 mg/kg 2-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl) ethy)-4,4-dimethyl-1,3-(2H,4H)-isoquinolindione dihydrochloride (ARC 239) (alpha(2B/C)-adrenoceptor antagonist), or 30 mg/kg naltrexone (opioid antagonist). Although positive modulators for the GABA(A) receptor (20 mg/kg 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one and 10-30 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide) and opioid receptor (10 mg/kg morphine) produced significant elevations, agonists for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (clonidine) and dopamine receptors (apomorphine) had no effect on Edinger-Westphal c-Fos expression. These findings suggest that alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal results from direct interactions with GABA(A) receptors, which are modified by alpha(2A/D)-adrenoceptors and dopamine receptors. Also using immunohistochemistry to identify potential intracellular mechanisms associated with alcohol-induced c-Fos expression in Edinger-Westphal, we show time-dependent increases in serine 727 phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) but no changes in phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein and phospho-Elk1. Time-dependent increases in phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 were found to occur simultaneously with increases in serine 727 phospho-Stat3. Finally, blockade of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation with the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor SL327 blocked alcohol-induced c-Fos expression, suggesting that alcohol induces c-Fos in Edinger-Westphal neurons through activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-Stat3 pathway.",,United States,2002,10.1124/jpet.102.036046,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12130710

He extensively discussed and supported this theory in the Volume 1 of his extraordinary book Textura del Sistema Nervioso del Hombre y de los Vertebrados. Also, Don Santiago significantly contributed to a detailed description of the various neural components of the hippocampus and cerebral cortex during development. Extensive investigation has been done in the last Century related to the functional role of these complex brain regions, and their association with learning, memory and some limbic functions. Likewise, the organization and expression of neuropsychological qualities such as memory, exploratory behavior and spatial orientation, among others, depend on the integrity and adequate functional activity of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. It is known that brain serotonin synthesis and release depend directly and proportionally on the availability of its precursor, tryptophan (TRY). By using a chronic TRY restriction model in rats, we studied their place learning ability in correlation with the dendritic spine density of pyramidal neurons in field CA1 of the hippocampus during postnatal development. We have also reported alterations in the maturation pattern of the ability for spontaneous alternation and task performance evaluating short-term memory, as well as adverse effects on the density of dendritic spines of hippocampal CA1 field pyramidal neurons and on the dendritic arborization and the number of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons from the third layer of the prefrontal cortex using the same model of TRY restriction. The findings obtained in these studies employing a modified Golgi method, can be interpreted as a trans-synaptic plastic response due to understimulation of serotoninergic receptors located in the hippocampal Ammon's horn and, particularly, on the CA1 field pyramidal neurons, as well as on afferences to the hippocampus which needs to be further investigated.",,Netherlands,2002,10.1016/s0079-6123(02)36013-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12143377

This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of prenatal DZ exposure on the function of the gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)(A) receptor complex. The method used - perfusion of rat hippocampal nerve terminals labeled with [3H]noradrenaline (NA) - allowed us to evaluate the effects of DZ on a specific native GABA(A) receptor subtype which is located on hippocampal noradrenergic nerve endings and mediates the release of NA. Muscimol stimulated synaptosomal release of [3H]NA in a concentration-dependent manner; maximal stimulation (50%) was achieved with a concentration of 30 microM, and the ED(50) was 1.7 microM. The effect of muscimol was potentiated by the positive allosteric modulators DZ and 3alpha-pregnan-5alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-P; allopregnanolone), which displayed similar maximal effects and affinities. In the presence of DZ (0.1 microM), muscimol stimulated the release of [3H]NA with an ED(50) of 0.5 microM; in the presence of 3alpha,5alpha-P (0.1 microM), the ED(50) of muscimol was 0.3 microM. Prenatal DZ exposure did not modify the concentration-effect curve for muscimol, but it did abolish the potentiating effects of DZ and 3alpha,5alpha-P. These findings demonstrate that prenatal exposure to DZ produces functional modifications of the GABA(A) receptor subtype we investigated. This effect may be related to the relative contributions of the various protein subunits that compose the GABA(A) receptor complex. Exposure to DZ while the GABA(A) receptors are developing might influence the expression of these subunits, giving rise to a receptor that can be activated by muscimol but is not susceptible to allosteric modulation by DZ or 3alpha,5alpha-P.",,Switzerland,2002,10.1159/000064947,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12145412

Community attitudes towards drug use vary according to the drug and often bear little relationship to the known pharmacological and toxicological effects of the drug. For an objective assessment of the potential dangers associated with drug use, a distinction is made between drug use and drug abuse. It is stressed that the progression from drug use to drug abuse involves social and psychological factors in addition to the pharmacological factors which are outlined in this paper. The sequential development of drug dependency is described under the headings: Induction; continued consumption; compulsive consumption; withdrawal; abstinence; reinduction. Man uses psychotropic drugs because he finds the effects rewarding. Some experimental models to explore the neurophysiological basis of the reward are described. Experiments employing inhibitors of protein synthesis suggest that the phenomena of tolerance and physical dependence involve the synthesis of new protein. It has been suggested that the new protein might be new receptor molecules for the drug or neurotransmitter substances. These new receptors might constitute a ""drug memory"" and provide a possible explanation for high relapse rate of drug dependent subjects.

To ascertain whether the AChBP exhibits the recognition properties and functional states of the nAChR, we have expressed the protein in milligram quantities from a synthetic cDNA transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. The protein secreted into the medium shows a pentameric rosette structure with ligand stoichiometry approximating five sites per pentamer. Surprisingly, binding of acetylcholine, selective agonists, and antagonists ranging from small alkaloids to larger peptides results in substantial quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Using stopped-flow techniques, we demonstrate rapid rates of association and dissociation of agonists and slow rates for the alpha-neurotoxins. Since agonist binding occurs in millisecond time frames, and the alpha-neurotoxins may induce a distinct conformational state for the AChBP-toxin complex, the snail protein shows many of the properties expected for receptor recognition of interacting ligands. Thus, the marked tryptophan quenching not only documents the importance of aromatic residues in ligand recognition, but establishes that the AChBP will be a useful functional as well as structural surrogate of the nicotinic receptor.",,United States,2002,10.1074/jbc.C200462200,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12235129

The binding profile at D(2) like, 5-HT(1A), and 5-HT(2A) receptors of title compounds was determined. Modifications made in the phenyl rings of the parent compound (1a) produced congeners endowed with a broad range of binding affinities for DA D(2) like, serotonin 5-HT(1A), and 5-HT(2A) receptors, with IC(50) values ranging from 25 to >10,000 nM. As for the modification of the piperazine N(4)-phenyl ring, the affinities for both D(2) like and 5-HT(1A) receptors were progressively increased by introduction of ortho-methoxy and ethoxy groups (1b,o, respectively). Data revealed the presence of a para-chloro substituent in 1g to be associated with a relatively high affinity and substantial selectivity for D(2) like receptors, whereas the meta-chloro analogue 1f exhibited preferential affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors. A quantitative structure-affinity relationship analysis of the measured binding data resulted in regression equations that highlighted substituent physicochemical properties modulating the binding to subtypes 1A and 2A of serotonin 5-HT receptors but not to D(2) like receptors. Thus, besides an electron-withdrawing field effect and ortho substitution, which both influence binding to serotonin 5-HT receptor subtypes, though to a different extent as revealed by regression coefficients in the multiparametric regression equations, the affinity of congeners 1a-r to 5-HT(1A) receptors proved to be linearly correlated with volume/polarizability descriptors, whereas their affinity to 5-HT(2A) receptors correlated with lipophilicity constants through a parabolic relationship. 1-[(1,2-Diphenyl-1H-4-imidazolyl)methyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (1b), with a D(2)/5-HT(1A) IC(50) ratio of approximately 1, was selected for a further pharmacological study. In rats, the intraperitoneal administration of compound 1b, like that of clozapine, induced an increase in the extracellular concentration of DA measured in the medial prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, 1b and clozapine each inhibited GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents at recombinant GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These findings suggest that compound 1b may represent an interesting prototype of a novel class of drugs endowed with a neurochemical profile similar to that of atypical antipsychotics.",,United States,2002,10.1021/jm020848t,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12361392

In this paper, we investigated the possible differential involvement of cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors in the insular cortex in short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) of taste aversion in rats. Taste aversion was induced by intraperitoneal administration of lithium chloride (a malaise-inducing drug) 15 min after experience with an unfamiliar taste. In order to test STM and LTM of taste aversion, taste stimulus was again presented 4 h and 72 h after lithium injection, respectively. During the acquisition, microinjection of the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine, in the insular cortex before, but not after, the presentation of the new taste, abolished STM as well as LTM. Blockade of the NMDA receptor, in the insular cortex, by AP5 before, but not after, the presentation of the taste stimulus, impaired LTM but left STM intact. Moreover, when injected 1 h after malaise induction (i.e., during taste-illness association), AP5 disrupted both STM and LTM. These results suggest that activation of muscarinic receptors in the insular cortex is involved in the acquisition of taste memory, whereas NMDA receptors participate in taste memory consolidation. These data demonstrate that different neurochemical mechanisms subserve different memory phases. NMDA receptors are also probably involved in processing the visceral input, thus allowing subsequent taste-illness association. This indicates that in the same cortical area the same neurotransmitter system can be involved in distinct processes: taste memory consolidation vs. taste-illness association.",,France,2002,10.1046/j.1460-9568.2002.02174.x,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12383243

No change was observed in plasma free fatty acid and glucose levels and oxygen consumption after intraventricular injection of norepinephrine (25 mug). Intraventricular injection of imipramine and safrazine produced a slight fall in the rectal temperature. Norepinephrine-induced hypothermia was more pronounced in rats pretreated with safrazine and less in rats pretreated with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, as compared with that in controls. Intraventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (0.75-250 mug) brought about a marked dose-dependent hypothermia. The second injection of 6-hydroxydopamine 5 days after the first injection had no effect on the body temperature. Norepinephrine injection 2 days after the second injection of 6-hydroxydopamine produced a more pronounced hypothermia than the change in control rats without pretreatments. Haloperidol did not affect the hypothermia induced by 6-hydroxydopamine. Intraventricular injection of dopamine and L-DOPA showed less effect that norepinephrine had.

Etiology of this dopaminergic hyperactivity, however, is unknown. We have recently demonstrated that subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment in rodents induces striatal dopaminergic hyperactivity similar to that observed in schizophrenia. The present study investigates the ability of PCP to potentiate amphetamine-induced dopamine release in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Prefrontal dopaminergic hyperactivity is postulated to underlie cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. In contrast, the degree of NAc involvement is unknown and recent studies have suggested that PCP-induced hyperactivity in rodents may correlate with PFC, rather than NAc, dopamine levels. Rats were treated with 5-20 mg/kg/day PCP for 3-14 days by osmotic minipump. PFC and NAc dopamine release to amphetamine challenge (1 mg/kg) was monitored by in vivo microdialysis and HPLC-EC. Doses of 10 mg/kg/day and above produced serum PCP concentrations (50-150 ng/ml) most associated with PCP psychosis in humans. PCP-treated rats showed significant, dose-dependent enhancement in amphetamine-induced dopamine release in PFC but not NAc, along with significantly enhanced locomotor activity. Enhanced response was observed following 3-day, as well as 14-day, treatment and resolved within 4 days of PCP treatment withdrawal. These findings support the concept that endogenous NMDA receptor dysfunction could account for the pattern of dopaminergic dysfunction observed in schizophrenia, and suggest that even short duration abuse of PCP-like agents may greatly potentiate behavioral effects of psychostimulants in drug abuse situations. Finally, these studies provide a model system in which to evaluate effects of potential psychotherapeutic agents.",,England,2003,10.1038/sj.npp.1300019,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12496938

However, the striatal accumulation of [123I]IBZM showed no changes among the control, MPTP-treated, and deprenyl-MPTP-treated groups.

The present study examined the effects of combinations of dextromethorphan and ketamine, two clinically used N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, with amitriptyline on formalin-evoked behaviors and paw edema. Pretreatment with amitriptyline or dextromethorphan (10-300 nmol) resulted in suppression of flinching behaviors induced by 2.5% formalin, but ketamine had no intrinsic effect. Combination of an inactive dose of dextromethorphan with amitriptyline, and vice versa, resulted in an increase of analgesia so that previously inactive doses now caused significant analgesia. Combinations of multiple doses of ketamine with amitriptyline did not modify the response to amitriptyline. Both dextromethorphan and ketamine increased the paw edema induced by formalin, and this was blocked by low doses of amitriptyline. In the absence of formalin, amitriptyline (1-100 nmol) caused a dose-related suppression of the paw edema produced by dextromethorphan and ketamine. Amitriptyline also blocked paw edema produced by 5-hydroxytryptamine and compound 48/80. Each of the drugs used in this study exerts multiple pharmacological effects. Increased analgesia by drug combinations (amitriptyline/dextromethorphan) could show the involvement of a number of these mechanisms (e.g. NMDA receptor blockade, blockage of sodium channels, blockage of biogenic amine receptors), while a lack of intensification (amitriptyline/ketamine) could reflect occluded actions due to expression of similar actions by the other drug. Paw edema induced by dextromethorphan and ketamine involves inhibition of biogenic amine reuptake, and the ability of amitriptyline to block biogenic amine receptors likely accounts for its inhibiton of these actions. Combinations of these particular agents could represent a method for augmented analgesia and minimization of local adverse reactions.",,United States,2003,10.1016/s0304-3959(02)00373-1,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12620609

However, consistent findings on the genetic basis of personality have yet remained sparse. In recent years, molecular genetics has begun to identify specific genes coding in particular for components of the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems representing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for behavioral traits. The QTL concept suggests that complex traits are not attributable to single genes. According to this polygenic model, the genetic basis of personality and behavior and its pathological variations thus results from additive or nonadditive interactions of various genes. As the number of suitable candidate genes constantly increases, the QTL model provides a reasonable explanation for the genetic basis of personality and its disorders. In this review, the current knowledge on the impact of a large number of candidate gene polymorphisms (e.g. variations in serotonin and dopamine receptor and serotonin transporter genes) on personality and temperament is summarized. Additionally, investigations of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in humans and animals, which currently intensify the identification of genes that underlie behavioral variations, are examined. The findings converge on the notion that a probabilistic rather than deterministic impact of genes on the expression of behavior will contribute to the demystification of behavioral disorders.",,Netherlands,2003,10.1016/s0166-4328(02)00267-x,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12642172

MDMA acts by releasing monoamines, including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), but receptor mechanisms underlying MDMA-elicited hyperthermia and cutaneous vasoconstriction are not known. The specific 5-HT2A agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) is a potent hallucinogen that also causes marked hyperthermia, suggesting the possibility that DOI, via stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors, might also cause sympathetically mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction. We tested this hypothesis in conscious unrestrained rabbits and rats. Blood flow was assessed by chronically implanted Doppler ultrasonic flow probes. Body temperature was measured by i.p. telemetric probes. We compared effects of DOI on cutaneous blood flow (ear pinna in rabbits, tail in rats) with effects on mesenteric blood flow and arterial pressure.Hyperthermia induced by DOI (5-100 microgram/kg i.v. in rabbits and 100 microgram/kg s.c. in rats) was preceded and accompanied by markedly reduced blood flow to the cutaneous bed, with no change in flow to the mesenteric bed. In rabbits, DOI (5 microgram/kg i.v.) did not affect arterial pressure or heart rate. DOI (100 microgram/kg i.v.) caused a moderate rise in arterial pressure. In rabbits, the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists ketanserin (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) and AC90179 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) reversed the ear pinna vasoconstriction induced by DOI (5 microgram/kg i.v.). In rats, ketanserin (3 mg/kg s.c.) reversed tail vasoconstriction and hyperthermia induced by DOI (100 microgram/kg s.c.). In rabbits, the cutaneous vasoconstricting effect of DOI (5 microgram/kg i.v.) was substantially abolished in the ipsilateral ear pinna after interruption of preganglionic sympathetic nerve activity by unilateral section of the cervical sympathetic trunk. Thus hyperthermia evoked by direct stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors is associated with marked sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction, selective for the cutaneous bed.

We characterized these neuroendocrine parameters in rats treated systemically with MPEP and compared them to those induced by the anxiolytic buspirone.

This desensitization was not associated with changes in mGluR5 or 5-HT1A receptor binding properties, expression of G-protein subunits coupled to these receptors, or in 5-HT-stimulated binding of [(3)H]-GTPgammaS to membranes. We conclude that MPEP acutely disinhibits the HPA axis, in part through uncharacterized changes in serotonergic signaling.

Schizophrenic patients have small P50 auditory-evoked responses to click stimuli compared to normal subjects. The P50 auditory-evoked response is a positive waveform recorded in the EEG approximately 50 ms after the auditory click stimulus. In addition to relatively small amplitudes, schizophrenic patients do not gate or suppress the P50 auditory-evoked response to the second of two paired-click stimuli spaced 0.5 s apart. Neuropleptic medication, which decreases dopaminergic neuronal transmission, increases the amplitude of the P50 auditory-evoked response but does not improve gating. Normal subjects have large P50 auditory-evoked responses to click stimuli when compared to unmedicated schizophrenic patients, and they gate their response to paired click stimuli or have smaller P50 auditory-evoked response amplitudes to the second of two click stimuli spaced 0.5 s apart. Schizophrenic patients do not gate and have similar response amplitudes to both clicks. We hypothesized that the small amplitudes of unmedicated schizophrenic subjects were due to a state of occlusion whereby excessive background noise in local circuits reduced the ability of cells to respond synchronously to sensory input, thereby reducing the amplitude of the P50 waveform in the EEG. Because the P50 auditory-evoked potential amplitudes increased with neuroleptic medication, which reduces dopaminergic neuronal transmission, we hypothesized a role for dopamine in modulating the signal-to-noise (S/N) in the local circuits responsible for sensory gating. To test the hypothesis that modulation of the S/N ratio reduces sensory gating, we developed a model of the effects of dopaminergic neuronal transmission that modulates the S/N in neuronal circuits.

Furthermore, unlabelled TA (IC50 = 5.2 nm) inhibited specific [3H]TA binding to the membranes of B96Bom-transfected HEK-293 cells more potently than did OA (IC50 = 1.4 micro m) and dopamine (IC50 = 1.7 micro m). Taken together with the result of phylogenetic analysis, these findings indicate that the B96Bom receptor is a B. mori TA receptor, which is negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase. The use of this expression system should facilitate physiological studies of TA receptors as well as structure-activity studies of TA receptor ligands.",,England,2003,10.1046/j.1365-2583.2003.00404.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12752654

However, the probability of DA release is not well understood. Current understanding of neurotransmitter release probability in the CNS is limited to the conventional synaptic amino acid transmitters (e.g., glutamate and GABA). These fast neurotransmitters are released with a repertoire of probabilities according to synapse type, and these probabilities show activity-dependent plasticity according to synapse use. Synapses for neuromodulators such as DA, however, are designed for signaling that diverges temporally and spatially from that for fast neurotransmitters: DA receptors are exclusively metabotropic and at sites that extend to extrasynaptic locations and neighboring synapses. In this study, the release probability of DA was explored in real time in limbicversus motor-associated functional domains of the striatum of a primate (marmoset; Callithrix jacchus) using fast-scan voltammetry at a carbon-fiber microelectrode. We show that the probability of axonal DA release varies with striatal domain. Furthermore, release probability exhibits a short-term, activity-dependent plasticity that ranges from depression to facilitation in motor-through limbic-associated regions, respectively. Rapid plasticity does not result from metabotropic D2-like DA receptor activation or ionotropic GABA(A) receptor effects but is dependent on Ca2+ availability. These data reveal that rapid dynamics in DA release probability will participate in the transmission of the patterns and frequencies encoded by DA neuron action potential discharge. Furthermore, the regional variation in these features indicates that limbic-versus motor-associated DA neurons are permitted to generate diverse DA signals in response to a given firing pattern.",,United States,2003,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-10-04378.2003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12764127

Here, Arc expression was used to test whether, in rats, co-administration of a 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor (paroxetine) and a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (WAY 100635) increases postsynaptic 5-HT function. After pre-treatment with WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.) caused a threefold increase in 5-HT in prefrontal cortex microdialysates. In situ hybridization studies found that neither paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.) nor WAY 1000635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) altered Arc mRNA abundance in any region examined. In contrast, paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.) increased Arc mRNA after pre-treatment with WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.). This increase was apparent in cortical regions (frontal, parietal and cingulate) and caudate nucleus but was absent in hippocampus (CA1). Increases in Arc mRNA were accompanied by an increase in c-fos mRNA. The increase in Arc expression induced by paroxetine/WAY 100635 was abolished by the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg i.p., daily for two days). In conclusion, paroxetine and WAY 100635 injected in combination (but not alone) caused a region-specific, 5-HT-mediated increase in Arc expression.

Both OX2R(-/-) and orexin(-/-) mice are similarly affected with behaviorally abnormal attacks of non-REM sleep (""sleep attacks"") and show similar degrees of disrupted wakefulness. In contrast, OX2R(-/-) mice are only mildly affected with cataplexy-like attacks of REM sleep, whereas orexin(-/-) mice are severely affected. Absence of OX2Rs eliminates orexin-evoked excitation of histaminergic neurons in the hypothalamus, which gate non-REM sleep onset.

The deficiency of S100B-immunopositive glia was detected during the vulnerable period in 5-HT neuron development and in brain areas proximal to these neurons. The reductions of both 5-HT neurons and S100B-positive glia were prevented by maternal treatment with a 5-HT(1A) agonist (i.e., ipsapirone or buspirone). In the current study, we investigated whether the offspring of ethanol-fed rats had a general decrease in the density of glial cells in the brain areas that contain 5-HT neurons, and we determined whether these changes were prevented by maternal treatment with ipsapirone between gestational days (GDs) 13 and 20. We estimated the density of vimentin-positive glia of the midline raphe glial structure (MRGS) at GD 20 and postnatal day (PND) 5 and of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes proximal to the dorsal and median raphe at PNDs 5 and 19. The results of this study provide evidence that in utero ethanol exposure is associated with a reduced density of GFAP-immunopositive astrocytes proximal to the dorsal and median raphe. Maternal ipsapirone treatment significantly increased astroglial density in the dorsal raphe at PNDs 5 and 19 and in the median raphe at PND 5, such that it either prevented (dorsal raphe, PNDs 5 and 19) or blunted (median raphe, PND 5) the effects of ethanol.",,United States,2003,10.1016/s0741-8329(03)00024-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-12798971

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic potential in depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder.",Murdoch D and McTavish D ,Drugs,,"Sertraline is a selective inhibitor of central serotonin reuptake. Thus, it enhances serotoninergic transmission--a property which appears to explain its antidepressant activity. Its elimination half-life (approximately 26 hours) makes it suitable for once daily administration. Although clinical experience with sertraline is limited, it appears to possess antidepressant efficacy similar to that of amitriptyline and dothiepin, marginally better than imipramine, and significantly better than placebo. Additionally, sertraline is the only antidepressant licensed in the UK for the prevention of recurrence of depression, and preliminary findings suggest that the drug may also be effective in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sertraline and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors possess tolerability advantages over tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline has minimal anticholinergic activity, is essentially devoid of cardiovascular effects, has a wide therapeutic index and may be administered to elderly patients or those with underlying cardiovascular disorders. However, as with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sertraline has been associated with gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, diarrhoea/loose stools) and male sexual dysfunction (primarily ejaculatory disturbance), although each of these effects is usually mild and transient, decreasing in frequency with continued treatment. As a drug class, serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as sertraline appear to provide significant advantages compared with the more established antidepressant agents, particularly in terms of tolerability. Although much broader clinical experience is required before sertraline's full therapeutic potential can be realised, if future studies confirm the encouraging initial findings, sertraline will undoubtedly become an important option in the treatment of depression.",,New Zealand,1992,10.2165/00003495-199244040-00007,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1281075

Although the mechanisms underlying this association are unclear, one possible substrate is brain 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmission, which is reportedly abnormal in several psychiatric disorders. This study examined the effect of a rat model of early life adversity, early maternal separation, on 5-hydroxytryptamine neurotransmission in adulthood. In vitro electrophysiological experiments revealed that, in early maternal separation rats compared with controls, the sensitivity of alpha1-adrenoceptors on 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus was significantly reduced, whilst the sensitivity of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptors showed a nonsignificant trend to reduction. In in vivo microdialysis experiments, the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor agonist-induced suppression of 5-hydroxytryptamine release in the frontal cortex was reduced in early maternal separation animals, suggesting desensitization of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A autoreceptors. There was no increase in basal 5-hydroxytryptamine in the frontal cortex as measured by microdialysis and a nonsignificant trend towards increased basal firing activity of classical (non-bursting) 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus measured by in vivo electrophysiology. Finally, early maternal separation failed to alter expression of messenger ribonucleic acids coding for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A or alpha1B receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus as measured by in situ hybridization histochemistry, suggesting that functional changes in receptor sensitivity observed are not due to changes in receptor gene transcription. The findings demonstrate that early life adversity programs changes in sensitivity of the two principal regulators of 5-hydroxytryptamine neuronal activity.

Octopamine release by one such pathway in the honeybee antennal lobe modulates olfactory processing in relation to nectar (sucrose) reinforcement. To test more specifically what role octopamine plays in the antennal lobe, we used two treatments to disrupt an octopamine receptor from Apis mellifera brain (AmOAR) function: (1) an OAR antagonist, mianserin, was used to block receptor function, and (2) AmOAR double-stranded RNA was used to silence receptor expression. Both treatments inhibited olfactory acquisition and recall, but they did not disrupt odor discrimination. These results suggest that octopamine mediates consolidation of a component of olfactory memory at this early processing stage in the antennal lobe.

Both DA (10-320 microM) and the D-1 agonist SKF 38393 (0.1-32 microM) increased cyclic AMP accumulation in striatal slices from the lesioned and intact hemispheres. The EC50 for DA to increase cyclic AMP accumulation in slices was greater in the 6-OHDA-lesioned striata compared to the intact striatum, but the EC50 for SKF 38393 was not affected. The D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 (10 microM) completely inhibited the ability of DA and SKF 38393 to increase cyclic AMP accumulation in striatal slices from both denervated and intact sides of the brain. In slices from the intact hemisphere the increase in DA-induced cyclic AMP accumulation was enhanced by the D-2 antagonist (+/-)-sulpiride (50 microM) but (+/-)-sulpiride had no effect on the DA response in slices from the lesioned side.

RB 101 is a recently reported systemically active mixed inhibitor prodrug of the two enzymes which metabolize the enkephalins neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and aminopeptidase N. RB 101 (2.5-10 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent long-lasting hyperlocomotion and attenuated the conditioned suppression of motility in mice placed in an environment where they had received footshocks 24 h before. In addition, RB 101 decreased the duration of immobility in the forced swim test. All these actions of RB 101 were antagonized by the selective delta antagonist, naltrindole, supporting the preferential involvement of delta opioid receptors in these enkephalin-controlled behavioural responses. The effects induced by RB 101 were also suppressed by prior administration of the selective dopamine D1 antagonist, SCH 23390, but not by the D2 antagonist, sulpiride. Attenuation of the conditioned suppression of motility was associated with increased striatal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC)/dopamine (DA) and homovanillic acid (HVA)/DA ratios, both effects being antagonized by naltrindole. This latter compound is also efficient to inhibit the effect of imipramine in the mouse forced swim test.

Rat cerebral cortex slices were used for the purpose. Forced swimming for 15 min and longer induced changes in behavioral activities of rats associated with a significant reduction of 5-HT-stimulated PI metabolism, without any changes in density and affinity of 5-HT2 receptors. This suggests that modulation of the receptor coupling process but not of the 5-HT2 receptor binding characteristics may be responsible for the significant reduction of 5-HT-stimulated PI metabolism in stress situations. Chronic antidepressant treatment tended to reduce 5-HT-stimulated PI metabolism. This treatment improved significantly the behavioural activities during forces swimming, and prevented the forced swimming-induced reduction of 5-HT-stimulated PI metabolism.

To determine involvement of serotonin-containing terminals in the binding of [3H]imipramine and [3H]citalopram, binding of these compounds was measured in rats after destroying serotonin-containing neurons with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Treatment with this neurotoxin decreased serotonin content by 90% and reduced [3H]citalopram binding to a similar extent. These results demonstrate that [3H]citalopram binding is a reliable marker for serotonin-containing terminals. Binding of [3H]imipramine was reduced by only 15-35% after 5,7-DHT treatment. These latter results suggest that only a small fraction of [3H]imipramine binding to brain sections is associated with serotonergic terminals under standard conditions used in autoradiographic studies with the ligand. Dose-response effects of fluoxetine and desipramine on displacement of [3H]imipramine binding in forebrain regions indicate that the ligand labels predominantly high capacity, low affinity binding sites. To determine the utility of the rat brain as a model for [3H]imipramine and [3H]citalopram binding in the human brain, binding of the ligands was compared in human and rat hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. The pharmacological characteristics of [3H]imipramine and [3H]citalopram binding were similar in the rat and human brain. However, substantial species differences were observed in topographic patterns of [3H]imipramine binding within the hippocampus and hypothalamus. The distribution of [3H]citalopram binding sites within the amygdala and hypothalamus were also strikingly different in rats compared to humans.

This hypothesis, in its simplest guise, posits the presence of a functional alteration in central dopaminergic systems in the brains of schizophrenic patients. Recent findings have resulted in a greater understanding of the complexity of the central dopaminergic systems and have led to revisions of the hypothesis of a simple functional hyperactivity of central dopaminergic systems. These recent data suggest that there may be regionally restricted changes in the function of the mesotelencephalic dopamine system, and that these changes may be in opposite directions. Such changes may be associated with dysfunctions of interactions between distinct dopaminergic terminal field regions, and may be subserved by functional derangements in other transmitter systems or reflect regionally restricted changes in expression or function of distinct dopamine receptors or catecholamine synthetic enzymes.

At both ages, AMPT pretreatment generally had little impact on D1- or D2-agonist-induced responding, whereas the greater DA depletion observed following AMPT/reserpine pretreatment was generally associated with suppression of both D1 and D2-agonist-typical responding. Thus, whereas in adult animals some degree of D1 receptor activation by endogenous dopamine appears to be necessary for D2 responding but not vice versa (e.g. White et al. 1988), in young animals there appears to be a reciprocal co-dependence of these two receptor subtypes, with extensive DA depletion suppressing responding to both agonists when administered separately. At 10 days of age, some D1 and D2 agonist-induced behaviors that were previously blocked by AMPT/reserpine were reinstated following combined administration of both agonists. In contrast, no clear evidence for reinstatement was seen following administration of the combined agonists to AMPT/reserpine-pretreated weanlings, perhaps due to the induction of potential competing behaviors. Whereas DA depletion blocked many D1- and D2-induced behaviors, such depletion conversely promoted the expression in agonist-treated animals of a number of behaviors that were not normally induced by the agonists in non-depleted animals. These behaviors typically involved an oral component and included grooming and mouthing following SKF-38393 in depleted 10-day-old pups, mouthing following administration of either agonist to depleted weanlings, and probing and intense self-mutilation (forepaw and tongue biting) following the combined agonists in depleted weanlings.

Rats displayed burying (active coping) if sawdust was provided on the floor and immobility (passive coping) if bedding was absent both during training and testing. The conditioned burying was accompanied by high plasma NE but low E and CORT concentrations, whereas immobility was associated with high CORT and low NE levels. A forced switch from the active to passive coping (training with and testing without sawdust) led to the highest rise in E concentration. The 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone, with anxiolytic properties, dose-dependently (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, IV) reduced defensive burying behavior and increased the amount of time spent on feeding behavior in the presence of bedding material. Both plasma E and CORT levels were further elevated by the higher dose of ipsapirone. In the absence of bedding material, ipsapirone failed to affect immobility behavior, but it dose-dependently elevated the stress-induced increase in E, NE, and CORT concentrations. Accordingly, the behavioral anxiolytic action of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone was restricted to active coping, whereas neuroendocrine activation by the drug was present in all conditions. It is suggested that the effects of ipsapirone on behavioral coping and neuroendocrine regulation are produced by different populations of 5-HT1A receptors in the brain.",,United States,1992,10.1016/0031-9384(92)90284-9,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1355919

The state of D1/D2 synergism was found to be independent of striatal D1 or D2 receptor density in rats as: (1) increasing striatal D1 and/or D2 receptor density (as confirmed by quantitative receptor autoradiography) by chronic treatment with SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) and/or haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg/day for 21 days) did not alter the normal pattern of D1/D2 synergism as determined by behavioral responsiveness to agonist stimulation of D1 or D2 receptors, and (2) 5 days of reserpine treatment (1 mg/kg/day), although not significantly changing striatal D1 or D2 receptor density, induced a breakdown in D1/D2 synergism (i.e., behavior was elicited by independent stimulation of D1 or D2 receptors). In addition, the density of striatal D2 binding sites was not indicative of behavioral sensitivity to D2 agonists. Chronic haloperidol treatment increased behavioral sensitivity to the D2 agonist quinpirole by a factor of 2. When tested 96 h after bilateral 6-hydroxy-dopamine injections or after 5 daily reserpine injections, supersensitivity to quinpirole was at least double that following chronic haloperidol, without accompanying increases in striatal D2 density. This enhanced sensitivity to quinpirole was no greater than that observed in neurologically intact rats treated concomitantly with a maximally stimulating dose of SKF 38393. Furthermore, rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions that were treated chronically with eticlopride continued to rotate contralateral to the lesion in response to quinpirole despite having hemispheric symmetry of striatal D2 receptor binding. By contrast, when rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions were given 5 daily reserpine injections, rotation was abolished, having been replaced by intense stereotyped sniffing, indicative of bilateral supersensitivity. The results support the hypothesis that two distinct types of dopamine supersensitivity exist: a modest one associated with increased D2 density, and a more profound one associated with a breakdown in D1/D2 synergism and independent of D2 density.",,United States,1992,10.1002/syn.890120103,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1357762

The cardiovascular depressive effects were associated with a large decrease in respiratory rate, hypoxia, hypercapnia and blood acidosis. All depressor effects of WIN55212-2 were abolished by the selective CB(1) cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716A. The bradycardia elicited by WIN55212-2 was inhibited by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist methylatropine. The natural agonist Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol also elicited cardiovascular and respiratory depression. In contrast, WIN55212-3, an enantiomer of WIN55212-2 lacking affinity for cannabinoid receptors, had no effect. The cannabinoid-evoked decreases in blood pressure and heart rate were much more pronounced in spontaneously breathing than in artificially ventilated urethane-anaesthetised rats. In contrast, the plasma noradrenaline concentration was lowered equally in both preparations. Our results show that activation of CB(1) cannabinoid receptors not only induces cardiovascular depression, but also markedly impairs ventilation. The second major finding of the present study is that the respiratory depression evoked by cannabinoids largely amplifies the cardiovascular depression.",,Germany,2003,10.1007/s00210-003-0787-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-13680088

Subcutaneous administration of the 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI: 0.2 and 0.5 mg kg-1), caused a marked decrease (50% of pre-drug levels 60 min after injection) of noradrenaline in hippocampal dialysates which was long-lasting (greater than 120 min).

Bath application of serotonin (5-100 microM) caused membrane depolarizations in 58 (67%) neurons, hyperpolarizations in 12 (14%) cells, biphasic responses in nine (11%) neurons, and no detectable change in seven (8%) cells. In some neurons depolarized by serotonin, the amine's responses could be mimicked by the selective 5-HT2 agonist (+/-)-1(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride and the 5-HT1C/2 agonist alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, and blocked by the 5-HT1C/2 antagonists ketanserin and mianserin. In other neurons depolarized by serotonin, the 5-HT3 agonist 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine mimicked, and the 5-HT3 antagonist, 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate, blocked the serotonin-induced responses. Depolarizing responses due to activation of 5-HT1C/2 receptors were generally accompanied by increases in the membrane input resistance, whereas depolarizations mediated by 5-HT3 receptors were associated with a decreased membrane input resistance. Superfusion with tetrodotoxin or low-Ca2+/high-Mg(2+)-containing media abolished about half of the depolarizing responses. Hyperpolarizations caused by serotonin were associated with a decrease in membrane input resistance, and might have been due to activation of a potassium conductance. These responses persisted in bathing solutions containing tetrodotoxin or low-Ca2+/high-Mg2+. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamine)tetralin hydrobromide mimicked, whereas the 5-HT1A antagonist spiroxatrine blocked, these hyperpolarizing responses. Other antagonists selective for 5-HT1C/2 or 5-HT3 receptors were without effect. Serotonin-produced biphasic responses consisted of either an initial depolarization followed by a hyperpolarization or the reverse. The selective 5-HT2 agonist (+/-)-1(2,5-dimethyoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride could only mimic the depolarizations, whereas the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamine)tetralin hydrobromide produced only the hyperpolarizations. Spiroxatrine, a 5-HT1A antagonist, blocked only the hyperpolarizations without affecting the depolarizations, and methysergide, a non-specific 5-HT receptor antagonist, depressed both the depolarizations and hyperpolarizations.

In the present study, similar in vitro methods were used to further characterize VMN neurons responsive to 5-HT, and to identify the receptor subtypes involved in mediating these 5-HT actions. Results from a dose-response experiment indicate that increasing the dose of 5-HT can transform an inhibitory response into a biphasic or even an excitatory response. This indicates that modulation of 5-HT release in the VMN could alter the net response of the VMN to this transmitter. By comparing the actions of 5-HT with the effects of selective agonists and antagonists, the inhibitory action was found to be mediated predominantly, if not exclusively, by 5-HT1A receptors, while the excitatory action was mediated predominantly or exclusively through 5-HT2 receptors. There appear to be few, if any, 5-HT3 receptors in the VMN, and their functions are unclear. The inhibitory and the excitatory phases of the biphasic responses were not mediated together by a single receptor subtype but were mediated separately by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, respectively. The presence of the biphasic response in a large proportion of neurons, therefore, indicates the coexistence of different subtypes of 5-HT receptors in many individual VMN neurons. The use of selective agonists and antagonists further indicates that the coexistence also occurs in neurons showing monophasic responses, and that the opposite actions mediated by the coexisting receptor subtypes can interact with each other. Therefore, changing the ratio of coexisting receptor subtypes could modify the net output of the VMN response to 5-HT. Together with behavioral studies by others, it emerges from our findings that the inhibitory action of 5-HT on VMN neurons is associated with, and may be responsible for, the stimulation of feeding and inhibition of lordosis, while the excitatory action is related and may lead to the opposite behavioral effects. Finally, with the coexistence in VMN neurons of two receptor subtypes that can mediate 5-HT effects on both feeding and lordosis, the VMN can serve as a substrate for 5-HT to coordinate these two behaviors.",,India,1992,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1451570

In the present study, using in vivo microdialysis in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the striatum of halothane-anesthetized rats, we addressed this hypothesis by assessing the ability of 5-HT(2C) agents to modulate the increase in DA outflow induced by haloperidol and cocaine, of which the effects on DA outflow are associated or not with an increase in DA neuron firing, respectively. The intraperitoneal administration of cocaine (10-30 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent increase in DA extracellular levels in the NAc and the striatum. The effect of 15 mg/kg cocaine was potentiated by the mixed 5-HT(2C/2B) antagonist SB 206553 (5 mg/kg i.p.) and the selective 5-HT(2C) antagonist SB 242084 (1 mg/kg i.p.) in both brain regions. The mixed 5-HT(2C/2B) agonist, Ro 60-0175 (1 mg/kg i.p.), failed to affect cocaine-induced DA outflow, but reduced significantly the increase in DA outflow induced by the subcutaneous administration of 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol. The obtained results provide evidence that 5-HT(2C) receptors exert similar effects in both the NAc and the striatum, and they modulate DA exocytosis also when its increase occurs independently from an increase in DA neuron impulse activity. Furthermore, they show that 5-HT(2C) agonists, at variance with 5-HT(2C) antagonists, exert a preferential control on the impulse-stimulated release of DA.",,England,2004,10.1038/sj.npp.1300329,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14560323

To date, the age-related factors responsible for these modifications are unknown. The neural lobe of the hypophysis (NL) is a particular brain region which does not contain neurons but does contain specialized astrocytes, called pituicytes, and numerous terminals of afferent axons, including (i) peptidergic neurohypophysial axons which terminate on the NL blood vessels, and (ii) axons containing both gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and dopamine (DA) which form contacts with pituicytes. Because evidence has recently been provided that GABA signalling mediates the morphological organization of astrocytes, the present study was designed to determine whether modifications of pituicytes during ageing were associated with modifications of the GABAergic axons innervating the NL. We show here that, in adult rats, GABA/DA axons form preferential synaptic-like contacts with pituicytes which express both GABAA and D2 dopamine receptors. We then show that, during ageing, pituicytes undergo dramatic modifications of their morphology, correlatively with marked modifications of the GABA/DA fibres innervating the NL. Lastly, in vitro experiments indicate that modifications of the morphology of pituicytes similar to those observed during ageing were obtained by incubating isolated NL of adult rats with a GABAA receptor agonist and/or a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, whereas inverse modifications were observed when NL of aged rats were incubated with a GABAA receptor antagonist and a D2 dopamine receptor agonist.

There is a pressing need for novel drugs, and much hope has been placed on the use of molecular genetics to help define them. However, despite evidence for a genetic basis to schizophrenia stretching back for over a century, and a heritability of about 80%, the identification of susceptibility genes has been an uphill struggle. Candidate gene studies, which have generally focussed on obvious candidates from the dopamine and serotonin systems, as well as genes involved in brain development, have not generally been successful, although meta-analysis indicates that the dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3) and the serotonin receptor gene type 2A (HTR2A) may have a very small influence on risk. Linkage analysis has provided robust evidence of genetic loci, for example, on chromosomes 8p, 13q and 22q, and also implies shared genetic aetiology with bipolar disorder. The identification of these loci together with advances in genetic technology, especially the characterisation of polymorphisms, the understanding of haplotypes and the development of statistical methods, has lead to the identification of several plausible susceptibility genes, including neuregulin 1, proline dehydrogenase and dysbindin. Interestingly, these genes point more towards a role for the glutamate pathway rather than the dopamine pathway in schizophrenia. We have attempted to replicate some of these findings in schizophrenic patients from SW China, and we find significant association with a novel neuregulin 1 haplotype, with proline dehydrogenase polymorphisms, but not with catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). The replication of neuregulin 1 association on chromosome 8p by several investigators is the most convincing to date, and the presence of a syndrome similar to dementia praecox of 8p linked families, and the lack of linkage of bipolar disorder to this region is a testament to the ideas of Kraepelin more than 100 years ago.",,Netherlands,2003,10.1016/j.ejphar.2003.08.105,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14623361

Negative symptoms are associated with the prefrontocortical area of the brain. Schizophrenic patients have a high rate of smoking, which by subjective as well as objective measures produces a cognitive benefit. We have previously shown that agonists at nicotinic receptors containing alpha4 and beta2 subunits can enhance amphetamine-stimulated [3H]dopamine ([3H]DA) release via the dopamine transporter (DAT) from slices of rat prefrontal cortex. This effect is selective for prefrontal cortex; the enhancement does not occur in striatum or nucleus accumbens. The enhancement is dependent upon activation of protein kinase C (PKC). In the current study, we show that the enhancement of amphetamine-stimulated [3H]DA release is maintained after 10 days of chronic nicotine treatment, delivered subcutaneously twice daily. There are no significant changes in the ability of prefrontocortical brain slices to take up [3H]DA in tissue prepared from nicotine-treated vs. saline-treated rats.

However, it remains to be ascertained whether the systems are hyper- or hypo-functioning, for the implications of the functional state. Indeed, differential functional states of the MCL branches are suggested to be the neural substrate of different ADHD variants. This review covers published and unpublished data from the Naples-High Excitability (NHE) rat, an animal model of ADHD, featuring its main aspects, with no hypertension. Therefore, a multiple approach based on morphological studies of dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, acetylcholine and GABA systems, synaptic (Calcium/Calmodulin kinase II) and extrasynaptic (chondroitin sulphates) environments, and molecular biology and pharmacological studies on the dopamine system has been carried out. Morphological findings suggest dopamine neurons in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to be hypertrophic in NHE rats. The mesostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine branches appear to be normal in basal conditions. However, the striatal interface is probably defective following activation. Conversely, the prefrontal cortex, which represents the second main target of VTA dopamine neurons, has many alterations at the basal level. Therefore, the emerging picture is the association of a hyperinnervating and hyperfunctioning mesocortical branch of the dopamine system.

The present study evaluated the histological and physiological effects of three once-daily treatments with two chemically divergent neuroleptics, haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p./day) and eticlopride (3 mg/kg i.p./day), measured in rats 24 h after the last injection. It was determined that this short-term antagonism of D2-like receptors induced fiber and terminal degeneration and significantly decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunoreactivity in the ventral pallidum (VP), as determined by optical density measurements. While other forebrain regions demonstrated changes in TH and BDNF, the neurodegeneration profile was unique to the VP. This was accompanied by an enhancement in the efficacy of the D2 agonist quinpirole to increase spiking rate of VP neurons recorded in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats. These data indicate that short-term treatments with D2 antagonists are sufficient to induce changes in the biochemical and morphological profiles uniquely within the VP.

This compound has low affinity for other transporters and receptors. The development of reboxetine as a potential antidepressant stems from the prior demonstration that blockade of the NE transporter imparts antidepressant activity. Desipramine, lofepramine, and nortryptiline are examples of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) compounds from the first generation of antidepressants that exert their effects by blockade of NE reuptake. Maprotiline, a non-tricyclic compound, is also a NE selective reuptake inhibitor. Unfortunately, these antidepressants are also associated with interactions with muscarinic, histaminergic, and adrenergic receptors, which are known to contribute to a variety of untoward side effects. Despite the positive pharmacological profile of reboxetine, i.e., selectivity and specificity, with relatively fewer side effects, its use as an antidepressant is currently limited to Europe. Reboxetine is marketed as Edronax in the UK, Norebox in Italy, and as Irenor in Spain. It is registered in Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Austria and Finland. Based on studies conducted primarily outside the US, the FDA granted a preliminary letter of approval in 1999. However, more recent clinical studies conducted in the US and Canada, prompted by the FDA, resulted in a letter of non-approval. To date, it is unclear why the further development of reboxetine as an antidepressant in the US has been halted. Despite this setback, reboxetine has been a valuable pharmacological tool to assess the role of the noradrenergic system in preclinical studies of depressive disorder.",,United States,2003,10.1111/j.1527-3458.2003.tb00258.x,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14647527

Increasing evidence indicates that neuroleptics can induce weight gain, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanisms underlying these conditions have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we describe molecular neuroanatomic aspects of current biology of energy homeostasis that would help to address the psychiatric issues noted above, focusing on the central leptin/melanocortin system. An adipocyte-derived hormone, leptin acts on the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (Arc) to inhibit feeding behavior and simultaneously to promote energy expenditure. Leptin activates Arc neurons producing alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) and inhibits those producing agouti-related protein (AgRP). alpha-MSH is an endogenous agonist for the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) that is expressed exclusively in the central nervous system (CNS), whereas AgRP acts as a MC4-R antagonist. It is also established that MC4-R blockade produces an over-eating/obesity syndrome in rodents and humans. Thus, MC4-R-expressing neurons are downstream targets of leptin. Of interest, MC4-R-positive neurons densely populate in CNS sites critical for energy homeostasis and associated with psychiatric disorders, including the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus and central amygdaloid nucleus. In addition, Arc alpha-MSH neurons receive serotonergic inputs from raphe neurons. Finally, an AgRP gene polymorphism has been associated with anorexia nervosa. These findings suggest that the central melanocortin system is a target for psychiatry.",,Japan,2003,,English Abstract and Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14653225

It has not been established, however, whether there is an opponent-process component to stimulant drug induced conditioned effects. In the present study the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model was used to examine this issue. Two groups of Sprague-Dawley rats with equivalent 6-OHDA lesions were administered five apomorphine treatments (0.05 mg/kg s.c.) either paired or unpaired to a 10-min test chamber placement. Apomorphine induced vigorous contralateral rotation and suppressed all ipsilateral rotation. While the apomorphine-induced contralateral rotation response can be conditioned to the test environment cues, the critical test of opponent-process theory in the present study was whether the opposite response of ipsilateral rotation would also become conditioned as a latent opponent-process response to the exteroceptive test environment cues associated with the apomorphine drug state. The postacquisition saline test for conditioning showed that the paired group exhibited higher rates of contralateral and ipsilateral rotation compared to the unpaired group. In addition, when the animals were subsequently tested with the dopaminergic receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg), unexpectedly, contralateral rotation was enhanced in the paired group, whereas, ipsilateral rotation was suppressed in both groups. While these findings are, in part, compatible with an opponent-process mechanism, the data supported a simpler explanation; namely, the mechanism of differential habituation in the two groups due to a blocking effect of apomorphine on habituation selectively in the paired group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Netherlands,1992,10.1016/s0166-4328(05)80207-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1466780

In rodents these agents produce a myriad of histopathological and neurochemical changes. Several lines of evidence suggest that a large number of these drug-induced effects are dose-dependent manifestations of the same general disinhibition process in which NMDA antagonists abolish GABAergic inhibition, resulting in the simultaneous excessive release of acetylcholine and glutamate. Progressive increases in the severity of NMDA receptor hypofunction (NRHypo) within the brain produce an increasing range of effects on brain function. Underexcitation of NMDA receptors, induced by even relatively low doses of NMDA antagonist drugs, can produce specific forms of memory dysfunction without clinically evident psychosis. More severe NRHypo can produce a clinical syndrome very similar to a psychotic schizophrenic exacerbation. Finally, sustained and severe NRHypo in the adult brain is associated with a form of neurotoxicity with well-characterized neuropathological features. In this paper several of these effects of NMDA antagonists and a likely mechanism responsible for producing them will be reviewed.

This chapter first briefly discusses the current knowledge status for these abnormalities, with emphasis on results derived from clinical molecular imaging studies. The evidence for hyperstimulation of striatal D2 receptors rests on strong pharmacological evidence and has recently received support from brain imaging studies. The hypothesis of deficient prefrontal cortex (PFC) D1 receptor stimulation is almost entirely derived from preclinical studies. Preliminary imaging data compatible with this hypothesis have recently emerged. The NMDA hypofunction hypothesis originates mainly from indirect pharmacological data. The interactions between DA and GLU systems relevant to schizophrenia are then reviewed. Animal and imaging data supporting the general model that the putative DA imbalance in schizophrenia (striatal excess and cortical deficiency) might be secondary to NMDA hypofunction in the PFC and its connections are presented. Equally important are the potential consequences of this DA imbalance for NMDA function in the striatum and the cortex, which are subsequently discussed. In conclusion, it is proposed that schizophrenia is associated with strongly interconnected abnormalities of GLU and DA transmission: NMDA hypofunction in the PFC and its connections might generate a pattern of dysregulation of DA systems that, in turn, further weakens NMDA-mediated connectivity and plasticity.",,United States,2003,10.1196/annals.1300.063,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14684442

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of specific receptors in the discriminative stimulus properties of the novel ""atypical"" antipsychotic quetiapine. METHODS: Rats were trained to discriminate quetiapine at 10 mg/kg and tested with a range of ligands, selective for specific classes of receptor. RESULTS: Full generalization to quetiapine was only seen with quetiapine itself (100%) and with the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (87%). Partial generalization was seen with the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (63%), the presumed preferential dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist PNU 91194A (54%) and the 5-HT/H(1)/M(1) antagonist cyproheptadine (55%).

Additionally, we examined dopaminergic and glutaminergic receptor binding in the striatum and hippocampus, which have been suggested to play a role in the etiology of schizophrenia. Rat dams were fed normal (25%) or low (6%) protein diets beginning 5 weeks prior to, and throughout pregnancy. The pups were tested at postnatal days (PND) 35 and 56 for PPI. Striatal and hippocampal NMDA receptor, and striatal dopamine receptor binding were quantified post-mortem in a subset of these rats. Female rats exposed to PPD had reduced levels of PPI at PND 56, but not PND 35, suggesting the emergence of a sensorimotor gating deficit in early adulthood. Striatal NMDA receptor binding was increased in PPD females. A decrease in initial startle response (SR) was also observed in all PPD rats relative to control rats.

The effects of clonidine on glandular concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine also were examined. These effects were compared with those of xylazine, a presynaptic alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. A single, high dose of clonidine followed by an overnight fast caused marked increases in calcium content and acinar secretory granules in the submandibular and sublingual glands, similar to those caused by reserpine. However, the calcium content of the parotid gland was not altered by clonidine, although there seemed to be a modest increase in acinar secretory granules. The clonidine-induced increase in submandibular calcium content could not be attributed to any adrenergic receptor activity since it was not blocked by either alpha- or beta-adrenergic antagonists. Unlike reserpine, clonidine did not affect catecholamine concentrations in the parotid and submandibular glands. Pretreatment with reserpine did not significantly alter the clonidine-induced increase in submandibular calcium content. It is likely that the greater accumulation of acinar secretory granules is related to the increased calcium stores of the glands in clonidine- and/or reserpine-treated rats. The large differences in calcium content among the three glands might be attributable, in part, to differences in the calcium-binding capacity of their secretory granules.

We thus undertook a parametric study of the effects of acute and chronic buspirone on the performance on a test of delayed gratification, as well as on the efflux of serotonin and dopamine (DA) in cortical and subcortical regions in rats. OBJECTIVES: Three experiments examined (i) the effects of acute buspirone on impulsive choice and how such effects were modified by prior chronic exposure to buspirone; (ii) the effects of chronic buspirone on impulsive choice; (iii) the effects on impulsive choice of a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635 tested alone and in combination with buspirone; (iv) the effects of chronic and acute buspirone on 5-HT and DA efflux in anaesthetised rats. METHODS: In experiment 1, rats previously trained on the delayed gratification task were tested with acute buspirone (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg). The same rats were then treated with chronic buspirone (1 mg/kg/day) over the next 65 days, and the effects of acute buspirone (1 mg/kg) re-determined at 20, 45 and 65 days of chronic treatment. In experiment 2, two groups of rats trained on the delayed gratification task were treated either with saline or buspirone (1 mg/kg/day) continually for 65 days before being tested with acute buspirone (1 mg/kg), WAY-100635 (0.08 mg/kg), or a combination of the two drugs. In experiment 3, rats received the same regimen of buspirone dosing as in experiment 2, before receiving in-vivo microdialysis for 5-HT and DA in the ventral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex. RESULTS: Acute buspirone dose dependently increased the choice for the small, immediate reinforcer (impulsive choice) but the effects of 1 mg/kg were reversed on chronic administration of buspirone. This increased choice of the large, delayed reinforcer, which was not accompanied by any changes in baseline (non-drugged) performance, was blocked by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635. The chronic buspirone regimen did not alter buspirone-evoked reductions in 5-HT efflux in hippocampus but did lead to a differential effect of acute buspirone in medial prefrontal cortex, with the chronic buspirone and saline groups exhibiting decreases and increases in efflux, respectively. There were no systematic changes in DA efflux under any condition. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that the effects of acute buspirone on impulsive choice are reversed following chronic treatment and are mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors, and suggest, in addition, that the behavioural effects may involve changes in 5-HT functioning in medial prefrontal cortex.",,Germany,2004,10.1007/s00213-003-1726-1,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14726995

Inhibitors of CDK5 increase evoked dopamine release in a way that is additive to that of cocaine. This presynaptic action of CDK5 also regulates glutamatergic transmission. Indeed, inhibition of CDK5 increases the activity and phosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and these effects are reduced by a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist. Using mice with a point mutation of the CDK5 site of the postsynaptic protein DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein, molecular mass of 32 kDa), in the absence or in the presence of a dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, we provide evidence that CDK5 inhibitors potentiate dopaminergic transmission at both presynaptic and postsynaptic locations. These findings, together with the known ability of CDK5 inhibitors to prevent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, suggest that this class of compounds could potentially be used as a novel treatment for disorders associated with dopamine deficiency, such as Parkinson's disease.",,United States,2004,10.1073/pnas.0308652100,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14769920

It is based on the paradigm of latent inhibition (LI), in which animals learn to ignore repeatedly presented stimuli not followed by meaningful consequences. In a series of experiments it was demonstrated that the capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli is lost in rats treated with systemic or intra-accumbens injections of amphetamine, in normal volunteers given amphetamine, in high ""psychosis-prone"" persons, in acute schizophrenic patients and in untreated male adult rats that were raised until weaning under conditions of extremely restricted stimulation. In addition, LI is lost following the disruption of the hippocampal input to the nucleus accumbens. In all of the above conditions tested for antagonism by anti-psychotic drugs a loss of LI is reversed. On the basis of these results we propose an animal model which accommodates a neurodevelopmental dysfunction, hippocampal pathology, mesolimbic DA overactivity, vulnerability to stress, and gender differences, all of which have been postulated as factors in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",,England,1992,10.1016/0022-3956(92)90040-u,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1491358

In rats and other animal species, acute MDMA administration produces an impairment in passive avoidance and other learning tasks. Different studies have shown that this learning deficit is not strictly related to the pronounced serotonin (5-HT) depletion induced by the drug. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at determining if acute MDMA administration induces in the rat hippocampus early molecular changes related to memory impairment in a passive avoidance task. The membrane expression of key molecules in memory consolidation, such as the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) was measured. Some of these studies were also performed after 5-HT depletion induced by the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). METHODS: Neurochemical studies were performed in rats treated with MDMA and killed 90 min later and also in rats subjected to passive avoidance 30 min after MDMA treatment. Western blotting was used for measuring the levels of NMDA receptor subunits, CAMKII and PP1. Enzyme activity assays were also performed. RESULTS: In hippocampal membrane extracts, passive avoidance training increased NMDA receptor NR1 subunit expression as well as CaMKII levels and phosphorylated CaMKII. In untrained rats, MDMA reduced NR1 and NR2B protein levels, membrane CaMKII levels and enzyme activity, and enhanced PP1 levels and activity. In trained rats, MDMA prevented the learning-specific increase in NR1 subunit expression and membrane CaMKII/pCaMKII levels. After pronounced 5-HT depletion by PCPA, MDMA impaired passive avoidance retention to a similar extent and also prevented the training-associated changes in NR1 levels and CaMKII activity. CONCLUSIONS: Diminished function of hippocampal CaMKII and reduced levels of synaptic NMDA receptor subunits appear to be involved in the impairment of passive avoidance learning induced in rats by acute MDMA treatment.",,Germany,2004,10.1007/s00213-004-1816-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-14985918

Apomorphine, in the doses of 0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg, showed a tendency to reduce incentive motivation. Ambulatory activity was inhibited, evidenced both by diminished distance moved and reduced velocity of movement. Amphetamine (0.25 and 1 mg/kg) and flupenthixol (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) failed to modify incentive motivation while stimulating and reducing ambulatory activity, respectively. In the mating test, apomorphine enhanced the latency to enter the male's half and reduced the number of proceptive behaviors. However, these effects were associated with the appearance of stereotyped sniffing. Amphetamine increased the propensity to escape from the male after a mount without having other effects. Flupenthixol augmented the duration of the lordosis posture. Neither amphetamine nor flupenthixol affected sniffing. These data show that facilitated dopaminergic neurotransmission stimulates neither paced female sexual behavior nor sexual-incentive motivation. Dopamine receptor blockade has slight consequences.

Synaptic plasticity occurs throughout life and is critical during brain development. Evidence from biochemical, pharmacological, and clinical studies demonstrates the huge importance of an intact serotonergic system for normal central nervous system (CNS)function. Serotonin acts as a growth factor during embryogenesis, and serotonin receptor activity forms a crucial part of the cascade of events leading to changes in brain structure. The serotonergic system interacts with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), S100beta, and other chemical messengers, in addition to ts cross talk with the GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Disruption of these processes may contribute to CNS disorders that have been associated with impaired development. Furthermore, many psychiatric drugs alter serotonergic activity and have been shown to create changes in brain structure with long-term treatment. However, the mechanisms for their therapeutic efficacy are still unclear. Treatments for psychiatric illness are usually chronic and alleviate psychiatric symptoms, rather than cure these diseases. Therefore, greater exploration of the serotonin system during brain development and growth could lead to real progress in the discovery of treatments for mental disorders.",,United States,2004,10.1016/S0074-7742(04)59006-2,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15006487

Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptors are abundant in corticolimbic circuitry, where they modulate NMDA receptor-mediated signal transduction. Therefore, pharmacological manipulation of mGlu5 receptor may provide a treatment strategy for cognitive disorders that are associated with NMDA receptor dysfunction. We sought to determine whether the recently described molecular and cellular interactions between NMDA and mGlu5 receptors coregulate higher order behaviors. We examined the interaction of the selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), and the use-dependent NMDA antagonist MK-801, on locomotion, stereotypy, working memory, instrumental learning, and corticolimbic dopamine release. MPEP, at 10 mg/kg, but not 3 mg/kg, impaired working memory and instrumental learning, transiently increased dopamine release in prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, and augmented the effect of MK-801 on cortical dopamine release, locomotion, and stereotypy. Pretreatment with 3 mg/kg of MPEP enhanced the detrimental effects of MK-801 on cognition. These results demonstrate that an mGlu5 receptor antagonist can potentiate the motoric, cognitive, and dopaminergic effects of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Thus, mGlu5 receptors appear to play a major role in regulating NMDA receptor-dependent cognitive functions such as learning and working memory. By extension, these results suggest that pharmacological potentiation of mGlu5 receptors may ameliorate the cognitive and other behavioral abnormalities associated with NMDA receptor deficiency.",,England,2004,10.1038/sj.npp.1300417,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15010696

A recent study shows that a pharmacologically increased concentration of brain kynurenic acid, an endogenous antagonist at the glycine-site of the NMDA receptor as well as at the alpha7* nicotinic receptor, reverses the excitatory effects of clozapine on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons into an inhibitory action. In the present in vivo electrophysiological study, we further investigated the mechanisms of action of clozapine on VTA DA neurons. In control rats intravenously administered clozapine (1.25-10 mg/kg) was associated with increased firing rate and burst firing activity of VTA DA neurons. However, administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonist MK 801 blocked the excitatory action of clozapine. Moreover, in rats pretreated with the antagonist of the glycine-site of the NMDA receptor, L-701,324, the effects of clozapine on VTA DA neurons were converted to purely inhibitory responses, including a decrease in firing rate and burst firing activity. Pretreatment with the alpha7* nicotinic receptor antagonist MLA did not affect the excitatory action of clozapine on VTA DA neurons. The results of the present study suggest that clozapine interacts with the NMDA receptor complex. In this regard, clozapine could affect the glycine site of the NMDA receptor or tentatively inhibit the glycine transporter. The inhibitory action of clozapine on VTA DA neurons may account for its beneficial effects in ameliorating symptoms of schizophrenia and may suggest further studies to investigate a role of the glycine site of the NMDA receptor as a target for novel antipsychotics.",,United States,2004,10.1002/syn.20008,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15034917

However, there is evidence that dopamine (DA) dysfunction may also be associated with BPD. Pertinent research and review articles, identified by Medline searches of relevant topics, books, references from bibliographies, and conference proceedings from 1975 to 2003, were reviewed. Evidence of DA dysfunction in BPD derives from the efficacy of traditional and atypical antipsychotic agents in BPD, and from provocative challenges with amphetamine and methylphenidate of subjects with the disorder. In addition, human and animal studies indicate that DA activity plays an important role in emotion information processing, impulse control, and cognition. The results of this review suggest that DA dysfunction is associated with three dimensions of BPD, that is, emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and cognitive-perceptual impairment. The main limitation of this hypothesis is that the evidence reviewed is circumstantial. There is no study that directly demonstrates DA dysfunction in BPD. In addition, the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic agents observed in BPD may be mediated by non-DA mechanisms of action. If the stated hypothesis is correct, DA dysfunction in BPD may result from genetic, developmental, or environmental factors directly affecting specific DA pathways. Alternatively, DA dysfunction in BPD may be a compensatory response to alterations in the primary neural systems that control emotion, impulse control, and cognition, and that are mediated by the brain's main neurotransmitters, glutamate, and GABA, or in one or more other neuromodulatory pathways such as serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine.",,England,2004,10.1038/sj.npp.1300424,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15039763

In the mouse striatum, increased DA neurotransmission arising either from administration of amphetamine or from the lack of the DA transporter results in inactivation of Akt and concomitant activation of GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta. These biochemical changes are not affected by activation of the cAMP pathway but are effectively reversed either by inhibition of DA synthesis, D2 receptor blockade, or administration of lithium salts. Furthermore, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of GSK-3 significantly reduces DA-dependent locomotor behaviors.

CNS and neurological disorders,,"Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide with a known involvement in anxiety and nociception processes, which acts through the activation of neurokinin-1 (NK(1)) receptors. Recently, a NK(1) receptor antagonist has been shown to display antidepressant activity comparable to that of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine, but with a better side effect profile. Given their lack of affinity for monoamine transmitters, the antidepressant role of NK(1) receptor antagonists has been attributed to a unique mechanism. However, monoaminergic neurons receive an important SP innervation and also posses NK(1) receptors (noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus) or are in close apposition to NK(1)-containing cells (serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus). In addition, NK(1) receptors are expressed in brain regions involved in the regulation of affective behaviours and the neurochemical response to stress. For these reasons, it has also been postulated that the purported antidepressant action of NK(1) receptor antagonists may result from the modulation of such brain monoaminergic systems. Indeed, systemic administration of NK(1) receptor antagonists enhances the firing rate of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons. This effect on serotonergic cells is seen consistently only after long-term treatment and has been associated with a functional desensitisation of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Mice lacking NK(1) receptors also show an increased basal firing rate of 5-HT cells in vivo. These observations are suggestive of a predominating inhibitory role of SP upon monoaminergic neurons under physiological conditions and would provide support for the antidepressant activity of NK(1) receptor antagonists, although this may be achieved through an indirect action on other transmitter systems. The possibility that this class of drugs can modulate the function of only certain serotonergic pathways could be the basis of their better side effect profile. However, although preliminary studies showed some therapeutic efficacy for NK(1) receptor antagonists, the first compound developed (MK-869) has been discontinued from Phase III trials because it was not more effective than placebo in the treatment of depression. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the mechanism of action of NK(1) receptor antagonists may be relevant to the antidepressant treatment.",,Netherlands,2004,10.2174/1568007043482516,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15078186

To establish this role, field stimulation and superfusion of rat hippocampal slices was employed to investigate the regulation of norepinephrine (NE) release by TNF. Chronic desipramine administration transforms TNF-mediated inhibition of NE release to facilitation, dependent upon alpha2-adrenergic receptor activation. Chronic i.c.v. microinfusion of polyclonal TNF antibody (pTNF-Ab) similarly transforms TNF inhibition of NE release to facilitation. To determine whether this transformation is due to desipramine-induced inhibition of TNF bioactivity in the brain, rats were i.c.v. microinfused with recombinant rat TNF (rrTNF) for 14 days, either alone or with simultaneous i.p. desipramine administration. TNF regulation of NE release in hippocampal slices isolated from these rats was compared with slices isolated from rats chronically administered desipramine alone. Although simultaneous microinfusion of rrTNF with chronic desipramine administration prevents the transformation induced by desipramine, microinfusion of rrTNF enhances TNF inhibition of NE release. These cellular events correspond to changes in immobility, analyzed by the forced swim test (FST). Intracerebroventricular microinfusion of rrTNF increases the duration of immobility of rats in the FST, compared with rats microinfused with aCSF. Desipramine administered chronically decreases immobility duration, which is mimicked by i.c.v. microinfusion of pTNF-Ab and prevented by simultaneous i.c.v. microinfusion of rrTNF. Thus, i.c.v. microinfusion of rrTNF with concomitant desipramine administration opposes decreases in neuron-associated TNF levels, required to transform presynaptic sensitivity to TNF, which is necessary for the drug to be efficacious.",,United States,2004,10.1124/jpet.104.067835,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15082752

In contrast to 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists, the antiallodynic effects of intrathecally administered alpha-m-5-HT (30 microg) and DOI (100 microg) were reversed by ketanserin, but not by RS-102221. These results indicate that 5-HT(2C) receptors have a role in spinal inhibition of neuropathic pain, and the effects produced by intrathecal administration of 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists are mediated by a mechanism different from that of alpha-m-5-HT or DOI, which seem to produce their effects through 5-HT(2A) receptors.",,United States,2004,10.1016/j.pain.2003.12.019,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15109520

Since deficits in working memory are associated with dopamine dysregulation and altered D(1) receptor signaling within prefrontal cortex, we present the case for targeting novel drug therapies towards enhancing prefrontal D(1) stimulation for the amelioration of the debilitating cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: This review examines the role of dopamine in regulating cellular and circuit function within prefrontal cortex in order to understand the significance of the dopamine dysregulation found in schizophrenia and related non-human primate models. By revealing the associations among prefrontal neuronal function, dopamine and D(1) signaling, and cognition, we seek to pinpoint the mechanisms by which dopamine modulates working memory processes and how these mechanisms may be exploited to improve cognitive function. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Dopamine deficiency within dorsolateral prefrontal cortex leads to abnormal recruitment of this region by cognitive tasks. Both preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between prefrontal dopamine function and the integrity of working memory, suggesting that insufficient D(1) receptor signaling in this region results in cognitive deficits. Moreover, working memory deficits can be ameliorated by treatments that augment D(1) receptor stimulation, indicating that this target presents a unique opportunity for the restoration of cognitive function in schizophrenia.",,Germany,2004,10.1007/s00213-004-1793-y,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15118803

A recent study in our laboratory found that intermittent injections of TDF led to robust locomotor sensitization in response to challenge TDF after a 2-week withdrawal period. The current study sought to determine whether the expression of TDF behavioral sensitization could be prevented by the DA D1-like receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (SCH), the DA D2-like receptor antagonist remoxipride (Rem), the competitive NMDA antagonist CPP, or the AMPA antagonist NBQX. Adult male C57/BL6 mice were injected with vehicle or 75 mg/kg TDF twice a week for 7 weeks, with locomotor activity measured periodically across the 14 doses. After a 2-week withdrawal period, mice were pretreated with SCH (0.015 mg/kg), Rem (0.3 mg/kg), CPP (2.5 mg/kg) or NBQX (10.0 mg/kg) followed 30 min later by vehicle or 75 mg/kg TDF and tested for the expression of TDF sensitization. Intermittent administration of TDF led to the development and robust expression of behavioral sensitization in terms of vertical activity. Pretreatment with SCH, NBQX and CPP successfully blocked the expression of vertical sensitization to TDF, while Rem pretreatment did not. All four antagonists, however, attenuated the neurochemical changes normally associated with TDF sensitization as measured 8 h after the 2-week TDF challenge.

Developmental brain research,,"Previously, this laboratory showed that in utero and in vitro ethanol exposure significantly reduces developing serotonin (5-HT) neurons and that treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist such as buspirone or ipsapirone prevents the ethanol-associated loss. The present study investigated whether ethanol decreases fetal rhombencephalic neurons, including 5-HT neurons, by causing apoptosis. We also investigated whether ipsapirone prevents the ethanol-associated deficit of fetal rhombencephalic neurons by reducing apoptosis. The results of these studies strongly suggest that the ethanol-associated reduction in fetal rhombencephalic neurons that accompanies both in utero and in vitro exposure to physiological concentrations of ethanol is associated with increased apoptosis in these neurons. A physiological concentration of ethanol (i.e., 50 mM) increases apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons and decreases the number 5-HT neurons. It also appears that the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone provides neuroprotection to these neurons by reducing apoptosis. Another mechanism by which ethanol-associated apoptosis can be blocked is by including serum proteins in the media at a concentration of 1% or higher; this concentration of serum proteins is high in comparison to the protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid.",,Netherlands,2004,10.1016/j.devbrainres.2004.02.009,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15158072

We examined reserpine-induced chemical denervation supersensitivity with special reference to alpha-1 adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes. 2. Chronic treatment with reserpine for 2 weeks depleted noradrenaline in the tail artery and spleen of rats. Noradrenaline in the thoracic aorta was negligible before and after reserpine treatment. 3. The treatment with reserpine produced supersensitivity in the contractile responses of the rat tail artery to phenylephrine, 5-HT and KCl, resulting in leftward shift of concentration-response curves (11.6-, 2.5- and 1.1-fold at EC(50) value, respectively). These results suggest a predominant sensitization of the alpha-1 AR-mediated response by reserpine treatment. 4. BMY 7378 at a concentration (30 nm) specific for blocking the alpha-1D AR subtype, but not KMD-3213 at a concentration (10 nm) selective for blocking the alpha-1A AR subtype, inhibited the supersensitivity of the phenylephrine-induced response in the reserpine-treated artery. On the other hand, the response to phenylephrine in reserpine-untreated artery was selectively inhibited by the same concentration of KMD-3213, but not by BMY 7378. Prazosin, a subtype-nonselective antagonist, blocked the responses to phenylephrine with the same potency, regardless of reserpine treatment. 5. In the thoracic aorta and spleen, no supersensitivity was produced in the responses to phenylephrine by reserpine treatment. 6. In a tissue segment-binding study using [(3)H]-prazosin, the total density and affinity of alpha-1 ARs in the rat tail artery were not changed by treatment with reserpine. However, alpha-1D AR with high affinity for BMY 7378 was significantly detected in reserpine-treated tail artery, in contrast to untreated artery. Decreases in alpha-1A AR with high affinity for KMD-3213 and alpha-1B AR with low affinities for KMD-3213 and BMY 7378 were also estimated in reserpine-treated tail artery. 7. Alpha-1D AR mRNA in rat tail artery increased to three-folds by reserpine treatment, whereas the levels of alpha-1A and 1B mRNAs were not significantly changed. 8. The present results suggest that chronic treatment with reserpine affects the expression of alpha-1 AR subtypes of rat tail artery and that the induction of alpha-1D ARs with high affinity for catecholamines is in part associated with reserpine-induced supersensitivity.",,England,2004,10.1038/sj.bjp.0705817,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15159276

Extracellular levels of dopamine were measured using microdialysis in conscious animals, and LY379268 was delivered locally by inclusion in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) flowing through the microdialysis probe. Local administration of LY379268 in the concentration range 10 nM-10 microM reduced basal levels of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens shell, whilst having no effect in the nucleus accumbens core. In the nucleus accumbens shell, basal levels were reduced to approximately 60% compared to the pre-injection control, with a maximal reduction occurring at concentrations of LY379268 > or =100 nM. The response to LY379268 (100 nM) was reversible, with levels returning to baseline following its removal from the aCSF. In a separate experiment, local perfusion of the nucleus accumbens shell with LY379268 (at both 1 and 10 microM) reduced the magnitude of the response to a subsequent systemic administration of phencyclidine (5 mg/kg i.p.). The reduction in the peak dopamine response was only evident with doses of LY379268 that also reduced basal dopamine efflux--LY379268 being ineffective against PCP at 10 nM. However, in animals pre-treated with LY379268 at 1 or 10 microM, PCP still evoked a dopamine response, and in these animals the relative extent of the response was not significantly different between the respective treatment groups. In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens core the magnitude of the dopamine response to PCP was unaffected by local application of LY379268 (at 1 or 10 microM).

At 96 h after the administration of picrotoxin into the basolateral nucleus, we have observed an increase in the expression of genes associated with 18 different monoamine (ie adrenergic alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 2, serotonergic 5HT5b and 5HT6, dopamine D4 and muscarinic m1, m2 and m3) and peptide (CCK A and B, angiotensin 1A, mu and kappa opiate, FSH, TSH, LH, GNRH, and neuropeptide Y) G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These latter receptors are associated with three different G protein signaling pathways (Gq, Gs, and Gi) in which significant changes in gene expression were also noted for adenylate cyclase (AC4), phosphodiesterase (PDE4D), protein kinase A (PKA), and protein kinase C (PKC). Quantitative RT-PCR was used to validate the results and demonstrated that there were predictable increases of three GPCRs selected for this analysis, including the dopamine D4, alpha 1b, and CCK-B receptors. Eight out of the nine monoamine receptors showing these changes have moderate to high affinity for the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine.

Prolonged, daily maternal separation of rat pups induces several behavioral, endocrine and neurochemical changes similar to those observed in human depression. OBJECTIVES: Because dysfunction of brain serotonergic systems has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression, the effects of neonatal maternal separation on these systems was studied in adult rats. METHODS: Male rat pups were subjected to daily maternal separation for 180 min (HMS180) from postnatal day 2 to day 14. Neonatal handled rats, i.e., pups undergoing daily 15-min separations during the same time period (HMS15), were chosen as a control group, since the 180-min separations involved handling of the pups, i.e., the pups were removed from the home cage during the separations. As adults, the effect of citalopram (0.05-0.80 mg/kg, intravenous) on the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) was studied. RESULTS: The inhibitory effect of citalopram on serotonergic cell firing was significantly enhanced at doses of 0.1 mg/kg and 0.4 mg/kg in the HMS180 compared with that in the HMS15 rats. However, the number of binding sites and mRNA expression of the 5-HT transporter and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the DRN did not differ between the two rearing groups. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that early life stress gives rise to persistent changes in the function, but not the density or mRNA expression of central 5-HT(1A) receptors and/or 5-HT transporters.",,Germany,2004,10.1007/s00213-004-1883-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15173929

Thus, schizophrenia may be regarded as a glutamate deficiency disorder. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) is an endogenous glutamate antagonist with a preferential action at the glycinesite of the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor. Mounting evidence indicates that the compound is significantly involved in basal neurophysiological processes in the brain. Thus, in anaesthetized rats, pharmacologically elevated KYNA concentration (by means of PNU 156561A) was associated with increased firing rate and burst firing activity of midbrain DA neurons. Similar alterations in basal firing characteristics are also observed following systemic administration of PCP or ketamine, indicating per se that elevated levels of brain KYNA is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Indeed, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) level of kynurenic acid was elevated in 28 male first episode schizophrenic patients (1.67 +/- 0.27 nM) as compared to 17 male healthy controls (0.97 +/- 0.07 nM. Elevated brain KYNA concentration was also found to dramatically affect the responsivity of rat midbrain DA neurons to the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Thus, whereas clozapine produced increased firing rate and burst firing activity of these neurons in untreated rats, elevation of brain KYNA levels was found to reverse the action of clozapine into a pure inhibitory response. The present study suggests a contribution of KYNA in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and link the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia together with the idea of a deficiency of glutamate function in this disease.",,United States,2003,10.1007/978-1-4615-0135-0_18,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15206728

Despite much initial interest, these amines have largely been thought of as little more than metabolic by-products. The recent description of a family of mammalian trace amine receptors has, however, seen a resurgence of interest in the physiological role of this class of compounds. Although the trace amines are well documented to cause amphetamine-like effects, such responses only occur at concentrations multiple orders of magnitude above normal physiological levels. As such, it seems unlikely that these responses reflect the true physiological role of the trace amines. In this article previous studies showing responses to physiologically relevant concentrations of trace amines are reviewed, along with those showing a reciprocal relationship between trace amine levels and fluctuations in basal monoaminergic tone. On the basis of these studies it is hypothesized that the trace amines function as endogenous neuromodulators of classical monoamine neurotransmitters.

Dopaminergic neurons projecting from the midbrain to forebrain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex, regulate motor and cognitive functions and coordinate the patterned response of the organism to sensory, affective, and rewarding stimuli. In this study, we showed that dopaminergic neurotransmission is highly dependent on M4 cholinergic muscarinic receptor function. Using in vivo microdialysis, we found elevated dopamine (DA) basal values and enhanced DA response to psychostimulants in the nucleus accumbens of M4 knockout mice. We also demonstrated impaired homeostatic control of cholinergic activity that leads to increased basal acetylcholine efflux in the midbrain of these animals. Thus, loss of M4 muscarinic receptor control of cholinergic function effectuates a state of dopaminergic hyperexcitability. This may be responsible for pathological conditions, in which appetitive motivation as well as affective and cognitive processing is impaired.

Recent data have suggested a strong association between depression and urinary incontinence. METHODS: Strips were cut from the bladder body and placed in organ baths containing Krebs solution. Contractions were induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS) and, in some experiments, by exogenous alpha,beta (alpha,beta)-methylene adenosine triphosphate. RESULTS: St. John's wort was significantly more active in inhibiting the EFS-induced contractions than the alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate-induced contractions, suggesting both a presynaptic site of action and a direct inhibition of bladder smooth muscle. The inhibitory effect of SJW on EFS-induced contractions was unaffected by methysergide, haloperidol, phentolamine plus propranolol (antagonists that block the action of the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytriptamine, dopamine, and noradrenaline on their own receptors), the L-type calcium channel antagonist verapamil, capsazepine (which blocks the vanilloid receptor), or cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. However, the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of SJW on EFS-induced contractions. Among the chemical constituents of SJW tested, hyperforin and, to a lesser extent, the flavonoid kaempferol showed inhibitory effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study demonstrated that SJW inhibits excitatory transmission of the rat urinary bladder and also directly inhibits smooth muscle contractility. The inhibitory effect on excitatory transmission could involve, at least in part, opioid receptors.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether, by virtue of its antagonist properties at 5-HT(2C) receptors, agomelatine elicits anxiolytic properties in rats. METHODS: Employing a combined neurochemical and behavioural approach, actions of agomelatine were compared to those of melatonin, the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB243,213, and the benzodiazepine, clorazepate. RESULTS: In unfamiliar pairs of rats exposed to a novel environment, agomelatine enhanced the time devoted to active social interaction, an action mimicked by clorazepate and by SB243,213. In a Vogel conflict procedure, agomelatine likewise displayed dose-dependent anxiolytic activity with a maximal effect comparable to clorazepate, and SB243,213 was similarly active in this procedure. In a plus-maze procedure in which clorazepate significantly enhanced percentage entries into open arms, agomelatine revealed only modest activity and SB243,213 was inactive. Further, like SB243,213, and in contrast to clorazepate, agomelatine did not suppress ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by rats re-exposed to an environment associated with an aversive stimulus. Whereas clorazepate reduced dialysate levels of 5-HT and noradrenaline in hippocampus and frontal cortex of freely moving rats, agomelatine did not affect extracellular levels of 5-HT and elevated those of noradrenaline. SB243,213 acted similarly to agomelatine. Melatonin, which did not modify extracellular levels of 5-HT or noradrenaline, was ineffective in all models of anxiolytic activity. Furthermore, the selective melatonin antagonist, S22153, did not modify anxiolytic properties of agomelatine in either the social interaction or the Vogel Conflict tests. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to melatonin, and reflecting blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors, agomelatine is active in several models of anxiolytic properties in rodents. The anxiolytic profile of agomelatine differs from that of benzodiazepines from which it may also be distinguished by its contrasting influence on corticolimbic monoaminergic pathways.",,Germany,2005,10.1007/s00213-004-1962-z,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15289999

Pharmac. (1985) 27, 184-192] have proposed that tritiated dopamine binds to a high-affinity agonist state of D1 dopamine receptors (D1h) which adopt this conformation when they are associated with the GTP-binding protein involved in the transduction process. Quantitative autoradiography was thus used to look for the distribution of these D1h sites in the rat brain and to compare it with that of D1 receptors labelled with [3H]7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benz aze pine [( 3H]SCH23390), a D1 antagonist. The effects of unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the ascending dopamine pathways on the density of [3H]dopamine D1h and [3H]SCH23390 binding sites in the striatum and the nucleus accumbens were also analysed. In the striatum, when D2 receptors were blocked by spiroperidol (20 nM), [3H]dopamine was found to bind specifically to dopamine receptors of the D1 type. Complementary experiments made with dopamine uptake blockers indicated that high-affinity dopamine uptake sites were not labelled by [3H]dopamine under our experimental conditions. The anatomical distribution of [3H]dopamine D1h binding sites was found to be markedly different from that of [3H]SCH23390 binding sites. This was particularly the case in the substantia nigra, some amygdaloid nuclei and the prefrontal cortex--structures in which the ratios between [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]dopamine binding sites were more than seven-fold higher than that observed in the striatum. [3H]SCH23390 binding was not significantly affected in either the striatum or the nucleus accumbens six weeks after a complete unilateral destruction of ascending dopamine pathways. In contrast, a marked decrease in [3H]dopamine D1h binding sites was found in both structures, but this effect was lower in the medioventral (-60%) than in the laterodorsal (-81%) part of the striatum, even though dopamine denervation was uniform throughout the structure. Preincubation of the sections with dopamine (0.5 microM) led to a partial recovery (+126%) in the lesioned striatum and an increase of [3H]dopamine labelling in the control striatum (+68%). This suggest that the presence of dopamine stabilizes the D1h state of D1 receptors. The absence or low amount of dopamine, either due to dopamine denervation or naturally occurring (prefrontal cortex), would then impair the [3H]dopamine D1h binding. In addition, a lower coupling of D1 receptors with adenylate cyclase was observed in the substantia nigra when compared to that in the striatum: this may explain the relatively weak [3H]dopamine binding in the substantia nigra.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,United States,1992,10.1016/0306-4522(92)90155-u,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1532052

Patients also frequently have noncognitive symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, apathy, and psychosis, that impair daily living. The most commonly prescribed treatments for Alzheimer's disease are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil and galantamine. Enhanced cholinergic functions caused by these compounds are believed to underlie improvements in learning, memory, and attention. The noncognitive aspects of dementia, however, are usually linked to serotonin and dopamine rather than acetylcholine because those neurotransmitter systems most directly influence mood, emotional balance, and psychosis. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry applied to mouse striatal brain slices was used to measure the real-time release of dopamine arising from spontaneous activity or from single electrical stimulations. At concentrations that include their prescribed dosage ranges, donepezil (1-1000 nM) and galantamine (50-1000 nM) increase action potential-dependent dopamine release. Consistent with previous literature, the data support slightly different modes of action for donepezil and galantamine. The ability of these commonly prescribed drugs to alter catecholamine release may underlie their influence over noncognitive symptoms of dementia. Furthermore, these results suggest that acting via nicotinic receptors, these drugs may serve presently untapped therapeutic roles by altering dopamine release in other disorders involving dopaminergic systems.",,United States,2004,10.1124/mol.104.000299,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15322245

Acquired fear is at the root of a variety of mental disorders, among which phobias, generalized anxiety, the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and some forms of depression. The simplest way to inhibit learned fear is to extinguish it, which is usually done by repeatedly presenting the CS alone, so that a new association, CS-""no US"", will eventually overcome the previously acquired CS-US association. Extinction was first described by Pavlov as a form of ""internal inhibition"" and was recommended by Freud and Ferenczi in the 1920s (who called it ""habituation"") as the treatment of choice for phobic disorders. It is used with success till this day, often in association with anxiolytic drugs. Extinction has since then been applied, also successfully and also often in association with anxiolytics, to the treatment of panic, generalized anxiety disorders and, more recently, PTSD. Extinction of learned fear involves gene expression, protein synthesis, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and signaling pathways in the hippocampus and the amygdala at the time of the first CS-no US association. It can be enhanced by increasing the exposure to the ""no US"" component at the time of behavioral testing, to the point of causing the complete uninstallment of the original fear response. Some theorists have recently proposed that reiteration of the CS alone may induce a reconsolidation of the learned behavior instead of its extinction. Reconsolidation would preserve the original memory from the labilization induced by its retrieval. If true, this would of course be disastrous for the psychotherapy of fear-motivated disorders. Here we show that neither the CS nor retrieval cause anything remotely like reconsolidation, but just extinction. In fact, our findings indicate that the reconsolidation hypothesis is essentially incorrect, at least for the form of contextual fear most commonly studied in rodents. Therefore, it seems safe to continue using extinction-based forms of therapy for disorders secondary to acquired fear. Further, it is useful and desirable to device procedures by which the ""no US"" component of the extinction is strengthened in order to alleviate the symptoms of victims of acquired fear.",,United States,2004,10.1007/BF03033220,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15325957

Synapses on this pathway are modifiable and synaptic strength can be turned up or down depending on specific patterns of activity in the pathway. The objective of this review will be to summarize the different studies carried out on this topic including very recent data and to underline the importance of animal models for the development of new and effective medications in psychiatric diseases. We have shown that long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal-prefrontal synapses is driven by the level of mesocortical dopaminergic (DA) activity and more recently that stress is also an environmental determinant of LTP at these cortical synapses. Stimulation of the ventral tegmental area at a frequency known to evoke DA overflow in the prefrontal cortex produces a long-lasting enhancement of the magnitude of hippocampal-prefrontal cortex LTP whereas a depletion of cortical DA levels generates a dramatic decrease in this LTP. Moreover, hippocampal stimulation induces a transient but significant increase in DA release in the prefrontal cortex and an optimal level of D1 receptor activation is essential for LTP expression. We recently investigated the impact of stress on hippocampal-prefrontal LTP and demonstrated that exposure to an acute stress causes a remarkable and long-lasting inhibition of LTP. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tianeptine, an antidepressant which has a unique mode of action, and clozapine an atypical antipsychotic when administered at doses normally used in human testing are able to reverse the impairment in LTP. Stressful life events have a substantial causal association with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and depression and recent imaging studies have shown an important role of the limbic-cortical circuit in the pathophysiology of these illnesses. Therefore, we proposed that agents capable of reversing the impairment of plasticity at hippocampal to prefrontal cortex synapses have the potential of becoming new therapeutic classes of antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs.",,United States,2004,10.1007/BF03033225,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15325962

The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of action of aripiprazole that underlies its favourable clinical profiles. The preclinical efficacy and side-effect profiles of aripiprazole were evaluated using several pharmaco-behavioural test systems in mice and rats, both in vivo and ex vivo, and compared with those of other conventional and atypical antipsychotics. Each of the antipsychotics induced catalepsy and inhibited apomorphine-induced stereotypy. The catalepsy liability ratios for these drugs were 6.5 for aripiprazole, 4.7 for both olanzapine and risperidone. The ptosis liability ratios for aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone were 14, 7.2 and 3.3, respectively. Aripiprazole slightly increased DOPA accumulation in the forebrain of reserpinised mice, reduced 5-HTP accumulation at the highest dose and exhibited a weaker inhibition of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine-induced head twitches. Aripiprazole did not inhibit physostigmine- or norepinephrine-induced lethality in rats.

Previously, we demonstrated that two such proteins, the D1 receptor-interacting protein calcyon and the D2 receptor-interacting protein neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1), were elevated in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia cases from the Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium. METHODS: The aim of this study was to confirm and expand these findings. We employed Western blot and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses to compare prefrontal (area 46) and occipital (area 17) cortical levels of calcyon and NCS-1 proteins and mRNAs between schizophrenia (n = 37) and control (n = 30) cohorts from the Brain Collection of the Mount Sinai Medical School/Bronx Veterans Administration Medical Center. RESULTS: The schizophrenia cohort showed significant up-regulation of calcyon protein and message levels in both prefrontal and occipital cortical regions, both of which also displayed schizophrenia-associated up-regulation of NCS-1 message. Protein levels of NCS-1 were elevated only in the prefrontal cortex. All increases in protein levels were correlated with those of corresponding messages. Furthermore, schizophrenia-associated alterations in the levels of calcyon and NCS-1 messages were correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of calcyon and NCS-1 in the second schizophrenia cohort strengthens the proposition that abnormalities of the dopamine system in this disease may lie in altered levels of dopamine receptor-interacting proteins. Also, up-regulation of both calcyon and NCS-1 in the cortex of schizophrenia patients can be attributed largely to an enhanced transcription or reduced degradation of their messages. Finally, our findings suggest that elevations in the expressions of calcyon and NCS-1 in schizophrenia may have the same underlying cause.",,United States,2004,10.1016/j.biopsych.2004.06.022,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15364041

Ovaries from 28- to 32-day-old rats were preincubated with [3H]NE, and the release of the recently taken up catecholamine in response to electric field stimulation was assessed. The release was strictly dependent on the presence of extracellular calcium and decreased when the frequency of stimulation was increased. This drop in [3H]NE release was significantly reversed by exposure of the ovaries during stimulation to yohimbine, a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor blocker. The existence of prejunctional alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptors in ovarian nerves was further suggested by the ability of exogenous NE to mimic the inhibitory effect of high frequency stimulation. NPY inhibited by 40% the release of [3H]NE induced by electrical stimulation. The specificity of this effect and its prejunctional nature were demonstrated by the finding that avian pancreatic polypeptide, a structural homolog of NPY that is not recognized by prejunctional NPY receptors of the Y2 subtype, failed to alter the induced release of [3H]NE. Neither NPY, avian pancreatic polypeptide, nor peptide-YY, another member of the pancreatic polypeptide fold family, altered progesterone or estradiol secretion from whole ovaries or granulosa cells in culture, suggesting that NPY (and its structural homologs) does not directly affect ovarian steroidogenesis. The results suggest that 1) the release of NE from ovarian sympathetic nerves is subjected to a dual modulatory influence provided by NE itself and NPY; and 2) this regulatory effect is exerted via specific prejunctional receptors. Such NE/NPY actions are likely to regulate the availability of NE to its postsynaptic receptors during ovarian development and adult function. The fact that NPY is mostly released during high frequency stimulation raises the possibility of NPY involvement in ovarian dysfunctions associated with situations of enhanced sympathetic discharge, such as strenuous exercise and psychogenic amenorrhea.",,United States,1992,10.1210/endo.130.3.1537296,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1537296

This DA input regulates aspects of working memory function, planning and attention, and its dysfunctions may underlie positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Despite intense research, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the basic principles of actions of DA in the PFC. In recent years, there has been considerable efforts by many groups to understand the cellular mechanisms of DA modulation of PFC neurons. However, the results of these efforts often lead to contradictions and controversies. One principal feature of DA that is agreed by most researchers is that DA is a neuromodulator and is clearly not an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter. The present article aims to identify certain principles of DA mechanisms by drawing on published, as well as unpublished data from PFC and other CNS sites to shed light on aspects of DA neuromodulation and address some of the existing controversies. Eighteen key features about DA modulation have been identified. These points directly impact on the end result of DA neuromodulation, and in some cases explain why DA does not yield identical effects under all experimental conditions. It will become apparent that DA's actions in PFC are subtle and depend on a variety of factors that can no longer be ignored. Some of these key factors include distinct bell-shaped dose-response profiles of postsynaptic DA effects, different postsynaptic responses that are contingent on the duration of DA receptor stimulation, prolonged duration effects, bidirectional effects following activation of D1 and D2 classes of receptors and membrane potential state and history dependence of subsequent DA actions. It is hoped that these factors will be borne in mind in future research and as a result a more consistent picture of DA neuromodulation in the PFC will emerge. Based on these factors, a theory is proposed for DA's action in PFC. This theory suggests that DA acts to expand or contract the breadth of information held in working memory buffers in PFC networks.",,England,2004,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2004.05.006,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15381316

An operational measure of this symptom is elevation of brain stimulation reward thresholds during drug withdrawal. Data indicated that increasing serotonin neurotransmission by co-administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine and the serotonin-1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI reversed reward deficits observed during drug withdrawal (Harrison et al. 2001). OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission, using the SSRI paroxetine which also inhibits noradrenaline reuptake, would alleviate affective aspects of amphetamine withdrawal. METHODS: A discrete-trial, current-threshold, self-stimulation procedure was used to assess brain reward function. The effects of paroxetine and p-MPPI alone and in combination were assessed in non-drug-withdrawing animals. We assessed also the effects of paroxetine and p-MPPI alone and in combination on reward deficits associated with amphetamine withdrawal. RESULTS: Paroxetine or p-MPPI alone had no effect on thresholds, while the co-administration of p-MPPI (3 mg/kg) and paroxetine (1.25 mg/kg) elevated thresholds in non-withdrawing rats. Amphetamine withdrawal resulted in threshold elevations. The co-administration of p-MPPI and paroxetine reduced the duration of amphetamine-withdrawal-induced reward deficits. CONCLUSIONS: Increased serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission decreased reward function in non-withdrawing rats, while the same treatment reversed reward deficits associated with amphetamine withdrawal. Considering that paroxetine acts on both the serotonin and noradrenaline transporter, these results indicate that the affective symptoms of amphetamine withdrawal, similar to non-drug-induced depressions, may be, in part, mediated through reduced serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission.",,Germany,2005,10.1007/s00213-004-2008-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15452682

Many of the drawbacks associated with these newer agents--slow onset, low rate of response, and low rate of remission--are likely to be mechanism related. In order to overcome these problems, researchers must either improve upon these traditional, biogenic amine-based mechanisms or explore nontraditional mechanisms. Strategies for improving biogenic amine-based antidepressants include the so-called serotonin augmentation strategy and the broad spectrum agent that simultaneously blocks reuptake at the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters. Two nontraditional approaches employ modulation of glutamate receptor function.

This inhibition is reversible by dialysis in vitro, which accounts for the dose-dependent duration of in vivo enzyme inhibition of 12-24 h. Moclobemide increases the content of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine in the brain, and decreases that of their deaminated metabolites. Its biochemical, neurological and behavioural effects indicate that it increases the extracellular concentration of the classic monoamine neurotransmitters/neuromodulators - in particular 5-HT. Potentiation of the cardiovascular effects of tyramine is less pronounced after taking moclobemide than after irreversible MAO-A inhibitors. Understanding of the physiological role of MAO and of the events that link inhibition of the enzyme with modulation of neuronal activities in the CNS remains incomplete. A major physiological role of intraneuronal MAO is to keep cytosolic amine concentration very low, to enable the neuronal monoamine carriers to produce a net inward transport of monoamines, and thereby to act as the first step in the termination of action of extracellular monoamines. MAO is likely to have a similar function in non-monoaminergic cells with respect to the monoamine carriers they contain. In addition to the classic monoamines, ""trace"" amines may become functionally active after MAO inhibition. An alternative role for MAO is that of a scavenger, preventing natural substrates from accumulating in monoaminergic neurons and interacting with storage, release, uptake and receptor function of monoamines.",,Germany,1992,10.1007/BF02246225,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1546143

We hypothesized that the anxiolytic-like actions of clonidine could be mimicked by stimulation of alpha-2 receptors on the mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons. Here, we test this hypothesis using clonidine or guanfacine (GFC), another alpha-2 agonist, in a model of aversive conditioning that selectively activates the mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons. One day prior to testing with drugs, rats were conditioned to fear a soft tone by pairing it with a footshock. During testing, the animals were subjected to the tones alone after drugs were administered systemically, or by local infusion into the regions containing the cell bodies and terminals of the mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons, namely, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the prelimbic (PL) cortex. Systemic administration of guanfacine blocked the increase in immobility in response to the conditioned tone and prevented the stress-associated increase in dopamine turnover in the prelimbic cortex. Systemic clonidine also prevented the stress-associated increase in dopamine turnover but caused sedation preventing behavioral measures. Guanfacine was then used in all local injection studies. The local application of guanfacine into either the prelimbic cortex or the ventral tegmental area did not prevent the conditioned fear-induced increase in dopamine turnover or the increase in immobility in response to the conditioned tones. We conclude that the anxiolytic-like actions of alpha-2 agonists are not due to binding to alpha-2 receptors on the stress-sensitive mesoprefrontal dopamine neurons.",,Netherlands,2004,10.1016/j.brainres.2004.08.057,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15494168

All three of these proteins bind to a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) to inhibit axonal outgrowth in vitro. To explore the necessity of NgR for responses to myelin inhibitors and for restriction of axonal growth in the adult CNS, we generated ngr(-/-) mice. Mice lacking NgR are viable but display hypoactivity and motor impairment. DRG neurons lacking NgR do not bind Nogo-66, and their growth cones are not collapsed by Nogo-66. Recovery of motor function after dorsal hemisection or complete transection of the spinal cord is improved in the ngr(-/-) mice. While corticospinal fibers do not regenerate in mice lacking NgR, regeneration of some raphespinal and rubrospinal fibers does occur.

Amphetamine challenge (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in control monkeys increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in a number of brain regions not described previously, such as parafascicular thalamus, precentral gyrus, and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. With the high spatial resolution, we were also able to readily identify changes in rCBV in the anterior cingulate, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, caudate (tail and head), putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Amphetamine induced decreases in rCBV in occipital and posterior parietal cortices. Parkinsonian primates had a prominent loss of response to amphetamine, with relative sparing of the nucleus accumbens and parafascicular thalamus. There was a significant correlation between rCBV loss in the substantia nigra and both PET imaging of dopamine transporters and behavioral measures.

Dopamine (100 microM) potentiated N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 10mM)-evoked depolarizations, but did not change those elicited by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA; 1mM).

The netrin receptor, DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), is highly expressed by dopaminergic (DA) neurons. DCC may therefore participate in the organization of DA circuitry during development and also influence DA function in the adult. Here we show that adult dcc heterozygous mice exhibit a blunted behavioral response to the indirect DA agonist amphetamine and do not develop sensitization to its effects when treated repeatedly. These behavioral alterations are associated with profound changes in DA function. In the medial prefrontal cortex, dcc heterozygotes exhibit increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels and dramatic increases in basal concentrations of DA and DA metabolites. In contrast, in the nucleus accumbens, dcc heterozygotes show no changes in either TH or DA levels, but exhibit decreased concentrations of DA metabolites, suggesting reduced DA activity. In addition, dcc heterozygous mice exhibit a small, but significant reduction in total number of TH-positive neurons in midbrain DA cell body regions. These results demonstrate for the first time that alterations in dcc expression lead to selective changes in DA function and, in turn, to differences in DA-related behaviors in adulthood. These findings raise the possibility that changes in dcc function early in life are implicated in the development of DA dysregulation observed in certain psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, or following chronic use of drugs of abuse.",,England,2005,10.1038/sj.mp.4001607,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15534618

Previous investigations have demonstrated colocalization of markers for GABA and catecholamines within two interneurons, B20 and B65, that participate in configuring the functional output of this CPG. This study examined the contributions of GABA and dopamine (DA) to rapid synaptic signaling from B20 and B65 to follower cells that implement their specification of motor programs. Pharmacological tests did not substantiate the participation of GABA in the mediation of the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from either B20 or B65. However, GABA and the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen were found to modify these signals in a target-specific manner. Several observations indicated that DA acts as the neurotransmitter mediating fast EPSPs from B20 to two radula closer motor neurons B8 and B16. In both motor neurons, application of DA produced depolarizing responses associated with decreased input resistance and increased excitation. B20-evoked EPSPs in both follower cells were occluded by exogenous dopamine and blocked by the DA antagonist sulpiride. While dopamine occlusion and sulpiride block of convergent signaling to B8 from B65 resembled that of B20, both of these actions were less potent on the rapid signaling from B65 to the multifunctional and widely acting interneuron B4/5. These findings indicate that dopamine mediates divergent (B20 to B16 and B8) and convergent (B20 and B65 to B8) rapid EPSPs from two influential CPG interneurons in which it is colocalized with GABA-like immunoreactivity.",,United States,2005,10.1152/jn.00003.2004,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15537820

Anticonvulsant action was mediated via, respectively, hippocampal D2 and 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, while proconvulsant effects were associated with concomitant hippocampal glutamate increases. We here examined whether increases in endogenous hippocampal dopamine and serotonin exert similar actions. Initially, dose-response experiments were performed with intrahippocampal perfusions of GBR-12909 and citalopram, respectively, selective dopamine and serotonin re-uptake blockers. Based on their effects on monoaminergic release, a potential non-protective, protective and proconvulsant concentration was selected. The predicted non-protective GBR-12909 (10 microM) and citalopram (0.5 microM) concentrations failed to prevent pilocarpine-induced seizures. The predicted protective GBR-12909 (100 microM) and citalopram (1 microM) perfusions resulted in complete anticonvulsant action, again mediated by D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. Unexpectedly, at predicted proconvulsant concentrations complete anticonvulsant action was obtained and hippocampal Glu remained unaltered. This study shows that selective monoamine re-uptake blockers have important anticonvulsant properties. Based on the previously established anticonvulsant monoamine ranges, anticonvulsant threshold concentrations can be predicted for compounds with endogenous dopamine or serotonin promoting effects. Non-selective actions curtailing glutamatergic activity may further be responsible for the unexpected anticonvulsant effects at predicted proconvulsant concentrations.",,England,2004,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2004.07.032,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15555639

Therefore, it is likely that adaptive changes in neurotransmission of key systems may only manifest upon chronic administration. Thus, using in vivo microdialysis we have evaluated the acute and chronic (21 days) effects of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine on nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopamine (DA) output in the rat. Clozapine (10 mg/kg p.o.) produced an acute 60% increase in extracellular levels of DA in the shell but not the core subregion of the NAcc. This clozapine-induced effect was also apparent on day 8 (59% increase) of chronic administration. However, on day 22 (following 21 days chronic administration), clozapine-induced a significant decrease in extracellular DA levels (44% decrease). Since clozapine possesses significant affinity for the 5-HT(2C) receptor these clozapine-induced effects were compared to those of SB-243213, a selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist. SB-243213 (10 mg/kg p.o.) had no effect on NAcc DA levels either acutely or following 21 days chronic administration. These data demonstrate that the atypical neuroleptic clozapine is more effective at eliciting changes in the shell vs the core subregion of the NAcc. In contrast, chronic treatment produces a time-dependent reduction in clozapine-induced DA efflux in the shell subregion. This selective temporal change in dopaminergic neurotransmission may be associated with the delayed therapeutic onset of antipsychotic activity. However, since SB-243213 had no effect on DA levels in the NAcc, it is likely that 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonism alone is not the mechanism by which clozapine exerts is actions.",,England,2005,10.1038/sj.npp.1300591,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15562297

In the present study, we have characterized alternatively spliced Caenorhabditis elegans tyramine receptor isoforms (SER-2 and SER-2A) that differ by 23 amino acids within the mid-region of the third intracellular loop. Membranes prepared from cells expressing either SER-2 or SER-2A bind [3H]lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the low nanomolar range and exhibit highest affinity for tyramine. Similarly, both isoforms exhibit nearly identical Ki values for a number of antagonists. In contrast, SER-2A exhibits a significantly lower affinity than SER-2 for other physiologically relevant biogenic amines, including octopamine. Pertussis toxin treatment reduces affinity for both tyramine and octopamine, especially for octopamine in membranes from cells expressing SER-2, suggesting that the conformation of the mid-region of the third intracellular loop is dictated by G-protein interactions and is responsible for the differential tyramine/octopamine affinities of the two isoforms. Tyramine reduces forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels in HEK293 cells expressing either isoform with nearly identical IC50 values. Tyramine, but not octopamine, also elevates Ca2+ levels in cells expressing SER-2 and to a lesser extent SER-2A. Most importantly, ser-2 null mutants (pk1357) fail to suppress head movements while reversing in response to nose-touch, suggesting a role for SER-2 in the regulation of foraging behavior, and fail to respond to tyramine in assays measuring serotonin-dependent pharyngeal pumping. These are the first reported functions for SER-2. These results suggest that C. elegans contains tyramine receptors, that individual SER-2 isoforms may differ significantly in their sensitivity to other physiologically relevant biogenic amines, such as octopamine (OA), and that tyraminergic signaling may be important in the regulation of key processes in nematodes.",,England,2004,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2004.02787.x,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15569254

In particular, negative and cognitive symptoms, which may represent the core deficit of the disease, remain inadequately treated. There is, therefore, a pressing need for more effective drugs. A number of drug discovery and development programmes are currently underway in parallel with significant research into the basic neurobiology of the disease. All antipsychotic drugs currently used in the clinic are antagonists at dopamine D2 receptors, and dopamine neurotransmission seems likely to remain a major biological target for research. However, novel approaches to modulate dopaminergic neurotransmission selectively in relevant brain regions may be required. In addition, a range of non-dopaminergic targets including glutamate, serotonin, neurokinins and acetylcholine are also of major interest. It is likely, however, that the importance of many of these targets may lie in their relationships to and interactions with dopaminergic mechanisms.

Evidence suggests that the hippocampal cholinergic system could be the point of convergence of anxiety and memory. We propose that clinically effective anxiolytics may exert their effect by interfering with this integration mechanism. To assess anxiety and aversive memory, we used the shock-probe burying test. A reduction in anxiety in this test is indicated by decreased burying, whereas impaired cognition is reflected by an increased number of probe-contacts and/or reduced retention latency. Both an aversive stimulus and the memory of that stimulus significantly increased hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) levels (Experiment 1). In fact, the memory of the event seemed to be more important than the event itself since the aversive memory induced a greater increase in hippocampal ACh. Injections (i.p.) of fluoxetine (Prozac) reduced burying behavior, while not affecting probe contacts or retention latency (Experiment 2). Although injections of fluoxetine did not affect basal hippocampal ACh efflux (Experiment 3), fluoxetine abolished the increase in ACh induced by the aversive stimulus and the memory of that stimulus (Experiment 4), emphasizing the significance of aversive memories in anxiety disorders. These actions may be mediated by a decrease in the event-related enhancement in cholinergic neurotransmission through M1 cholinergic receptors (Experiment 5). Therefore, anxiety disorders may stem from an unopposed formation of aversive memories and clinically effective anxiolytics hinder the association between emotional and cognitive processing. This reduces the emotional impact of aversive memories, thereby opposing consequent anxiety.",,England,2005,10.1038/sj.npp.1300624,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15592351

OBJECTIVES: The experiments described below sought to determine the effects of acute or repeated intra-mPFC injections of the dopamine D(2) antagonist sulpiride on subsequent motor-stimulant and nucleus accumbens dopamine responses to cocaine. METHODS: Rats received bilateral cannulae implants above the ventral mPFC for microinjections and above the nucleus accumbens for in vivo microdialysis. Initial studies examined the effects of intra-mPFC sulpiride pretreatment on the acute motor-stimulant and nucleus accumbens dopamine responses to cocaine. Follow-up studies determined the effects of repeated intra-mPFC sulpiride injections on subsequent behavioral and nucleus accumbens dopamine responses to a cocaine challenge. RESULTS: Intra-mPFC sulpiride enhanced the cocaine-induced increases in motor activity and dopamine overflow in the nucleus accumbens.

OBJECTIVE: We wished to examine whether the impaired thermoregulation was associated with decreased cerebral 5-HT content produced by the prior neurotoxic dose of MDMA. METHODS: Rats were injected with drugs decreasing 5-HT function [the tryptophan hydroxlase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), and 5-HT receptor antagonists] and rectal temperature was measured after administering MDMA to rats housed at 30 degrees C. RESULTS: PCPA pretreatment decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in cortex, hippocampus and striatum by >80% and prolonged the hyperthermia induced in rats housed at 30 degrees C by administering MDMA (5 mg/kg i.p.). A similar prolongation of the hyperthermic response to MDMA was seen when rats were pretreated with methysergide (10 mg/kg i.p.) or the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing 5-HT function in diverse ways enhanced the hyperthermic response to MDMA given to rats housed at high ambient temperature. This suggests that loss of 5-HT acting on 5-HT(1A) receptors leads to impaired thermoregulation in rats and suggests that the impairment seen in MDMA pretreated rats housed at high ambient temperature is due to a loss in 5-HT function. These data could have implications for recreational users of MDMA, who may have damaged serotoninergic neurons because of prior heavy or frequent use of the drug, when taking further doses of MDMA in hot environments such as dance clubs.",,Germany,2005,10.1007/s00213-004-2106-1,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15650843

Interestingly, nicotine and similar compounds have been shown to enhance memory function and increase the expression of nAChRs and therefore, could have a therapeutic role in the aforementioned diseases. Nicotine has also been shown to exert positive effects on certain neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF), and therefore could play a role beyond mere symptomatic therapy. However, to date, comprehensive studies of nicotine's effects on the expression of specific acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subtypes, key cholinergic proteins (that are regulated by NGF) such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) are lacking. Studies to further investigate the effects of nicotine on NGF especially its high- and low-affinity receptors are also needed. In the present study, male Wistar rats exposed a relatively low dosage of nicotine (0.35 mg/kg every 12 h) for 14 days demonstrated improved memory performance (assessed in two separate water maze testing methods) when compared with controls. Autoradiographic experiments indicated that nicotine increased [3H]-epibatidine, [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin and [3H]-AFDX384, but not [3H]-pirenzepine binding sites in several learning- and memory-related brain areas. The expression of ChAT, VAChT, as well as tropomyosin-receptor kinase A (TrkA) NGF receptors and phospho-TrK receptors was increased by nicotine in the hippocampus. No changes were observed in the levels of the NGF peptide or low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR), however. These results suggest that repeated exposure to nicotine results in positive effects on central cholinergic markers and memory function, which may be mediated via effects on high-affinity NGF receptors.",,United States,2005,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.10.006,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15652996

Few medications are available to treat the disorder. Anecdotal reports suggest that ibogaine, a natural alkaloid, reverses behaviors associated with addiction including alcoholism; however, because of side effects, ibogaine is not used clinically. In this study, we first characterized the actions of ibogaine on ethanol self-administration in rodents. Ibogaine decreased ethanol intake by rats in two-bottle choice and operant self-administration paradigms. Ibogaine also reduced operant self-administration of ethanol in a relapse model. Next, we identified a molecular mechanism that mediates the desirable activities of ibogaine on ethanol intake. Microinjection of ibogaine into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), but not the substantia nigra, reduced self-administration of ethanol, and systemic administration of ibogaine increased the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in a midbrain region that includes the VTA. In dopaminergic neuron-like SHSY5Y cells, ibogaine treatment upregulated the GDNF pathway as indicated by increases in phosphorylation of the GDNF receptor, Ret, and the downstream kinase, ERK1 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1). Finally, the ibogaine-mediated decrease in ethanol self-administration was mimicked by intra-VTA microinjection of GDNF and was reduced by intra-VTA delivery of anti-GDNF neutralizing antibodies. Together, these results suggest that GDNF in the VTA mediates the action of ibogaine on ethanol consumption. These findings highlight the importance of GDNF as a new target for drug development for alcoholism that may mimic the effect of ibogaine against alcohol consumption but avoid the negative side effects.",,United States,2005,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3959-04.2005,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15659598

Rodents manifest locomotor and stereotypic behaviors when treated with NMDA receptor antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) or dizocilpine maleate (MK-801); these behaviors are usually associated with an activated dopamine system. However, recent evidence suggests that increased glutamatergic transmission mediates the effects of these NMDA receptor antagonists. The role of dopamine in PCP- and MK-801-induced behavior (eg hyperlocomotion) remains unclear. We used dopamine-deficient (DD) mice in which tyrosine hydroxylase is selectively inactivated in dopaminergic neurons to determine whether dopamine is required for the locomotor and molecular effects of PCP and MK-801. DD mice showed a similar increase in locomotor activity and c-fos mRNA induction in the striatum in response to these NMDA receptor antagonists as control mice. Restoration of dopamine signaling in DD mice enhanced their locomotor response to PCP and MK-801. Administration of LY379268, a group II metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist that inhibits glutamate release, blocked PCP- and MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion in both DD and control mice.

In contrast, more recent models focus on dysfunction of glutamatergic systems, acting particularly through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. NMDA receptors in brain are regulated by glycine, acting via a strychnine-insensitive regulatory site, and by glycine (GlyT1) transporters that maintain low glycine levels in the immediate vicinity of the NMDA receptor complex. The present study investigates the role of NMDA receptors in the modulation of striatal dopamine release in vitro, and of glycine transport inhibitors (GTIs) as potential psychotherapeutic agents in schizophrenia. In striatum, NMDA receptors exert dual excitatory/inhibitory effects, with inhibition reflecting activity of local GABAergic feedback regulation. We have previously demonstrated effectiveness of glycine in regulating [3H]DA release both in vivo and in vitro, consistent with its beneficial clinical effects. In the present study, similar effects were observed for the high-affinity GTI (+)N[3-(4'-fluorophenyl)-3-(4'-phenylphenoxy-)propyl]sarcosine (NFPS), and for a range of high-affinity GTIs with appropriate rank order of potency. In addition, (+)NFPS significantly stimulated NMDA-induced [3H]GABA release. Effects, of GTIs, were blocked by the glycine-site antagonists L689,560 and HA-966, and the GABA(B) antagonists phaclofen and CGP 52432, confirming the roles of both the NMDA-associated glycine-site and presynaptic GABA(B) receptors in NMDA receptor-mediated regulation of striatal DA release in vitro. Endogenous DA hyperactivity is associated with prominent positive symptoms in schizophrenia.

Many studies have established that typical neuroleptic drugs do not improve cognitive impairment. Atypical antipsychotics improve cognition, but the pattern of improvement differs from drug to drug. Diminished cholinergic activity has been associated with memory impairments. Why atypical drugs improve aspects of cognition might lie in their ability to increase dopamine and acetylcholine in the prefrontal cortex. An optimum amount of dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is critical for cognitive functioning. Another mechanism is related to procedural learning, and would explain the quality of the practice during repeated evaluations with atypical antipsychotics due to a more balanced blockage of D2 receptors. Laboratory studies have shown that clozapine, ziprasidone, olanzapine, and risperidone all selectively increase acetylcholine release in the prefrontal cortex, whereas this is not true for haloperidol and thioridazine. A few studies have suggested that cholinomimetics or AChE inhibitors can improve memory functions not only in Alzheimer's disease but also in other pathologies. Some studies support the role of decreased cholinergic activity in the cognitive deficits while others demonstrate that decreased choline acetyltransferase activity is related to deterioration in cognitive performance in schizophrenia. Overall, results suggest the hypothesis that the cholinergic system is involved in the cognitive dysfunctions observed in schizophrenia and that increased cholinergic activity may improve these impairments. Furthermore, a dysfunction of glutamatergic neurotransmission could play a key role in cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Further meta-analysis of various clinical trials in this field is required to account for matters on the grounds of evidence-based medicine.",,England,2005,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2004.11.004,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15694228

HG1 is an ethyl arylmethyloxypiperidine acetate and an antagonist of 5-HT-moduline, which has no 5-HT-moduline agonist effect. In a pilot study, HG1 has demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile in three mouse models of anxiety (elevated plus maze, light/dark, four plates). The aim of our study was to examine the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 in the mouse elevated plus maze. Male Swiss mice were acutely administered HG1 at active doses in association with GABA antagonists such as flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxine, then, with 5-HT1A (NAN 190, WAY 100635) and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (methiothepine). Finally, we tried to potentiate non-active doses of HG1 with 5-HT1A (8-OHDPAT) and 5-HT1B receptor agonists (anpirtoline) in the mouse elevated plus maze. Regarding GABA antagonists, only flumazenil antagonised active doses of HG1 in an incomplete manner. Moreover, non-active doses of HG1 were potentiated by low doses of WAY 100635 and by anpirtoline but not by 8-OHDPAT. Finally, the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 at active doses were antagonised by all serotonergic antagonists (WAY 100635 at higher dose, NAN 190 and methiothepin). HG1 mechanism of action in the mouse elevated plus maze seems to associate a GABA-ergic component exerting a limited regulation of 5-HT neuronal activity and a major serotonergic component, which seems to implicate presynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.",,Netherlands,2005,10.1016/j.bbr.2004.09.015,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15698901

In hippocampus, after 2 weeks of treatment with escitalopram (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or citalopram (20 mg/kg/day, s.c.), the administration of the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (20-100 microg/kg, i.v.) dose-dependently induced a similar increase in the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA(3) pyramidal neurons, thus revealing direct functional evidence of an enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. In dorsal raphe nucleus, escitalopram was four times more potent than citalopram in suppressing the firing activity of presumed 5-HT neurons (ED(50)=58 and 254 mug/kg, i.v., respectively). Interestingly, the suppressant effect of escitalopram (100 microg/kg, i.v.) was significantly prevented, but not reversed by R-citalopram (250 microg/kg, i.v.). Sustained administration of escitalopram and citalopram significantly decreased the spontaneous firing activity of presumed 5-HT neurons. This firing activity returned to control rate after 2 weeks in rats treated with escitalopram, but only after 3 weeks using citalopram, and was associated with a desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. These results suggest that the time course of the gradual return of presumed 5-HT neuronal firing activity, which was reported to account for the delayed effect of SSRI on 5-HT transmission, is congruent with the earlier onset of action of escitalopram vs citalopram in validated animal models of depression and anxiety.",,England,2005,10.1038/sj.npp.1300686,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15702136

The underlying mechanisms are, however, mostly obscure. We present evidence that a form of experience-dependent plasticity of aggression in crickets is mediated by octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline. In a forced-fight paradigm, the experience of flying maximized the aggressiveness of crickets at their first encounter and accelerated the subsequent recovery of aggressiveness of the normally submissive losers, without enhancing general excitability as evaluated from the animals' startle responses to wind stimulation. This effect is transitory and concurrent with the activation of the octopaminergic system that accompanies flight. Hemocoel injections of the octopamine agonist chlordimeform (CDM) had similar effects on aggression but also enhanced startle responses. Serotonin depletion, achieved using alpha-methyl-tryptophan, enhanced startle responses without influencing aggression, indicating that the effect of CDM on aggression is not attributable to increased general excitation. Contrasting this, aggressiveness was depressed, and the effect of flying was essentially abolished, in crickets depleted of octopamine and dopamine using alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMT). CDM restored aggressiveness in AMT-treated crickets, indicating that their depressed aggressiveness is attributable to octopamine depletion rather than to dopamine depletion or nonspecific defects. Finally, the flight effect was blocked in crickets treated with the octopamine receptor antagonist epinastine, or with the alpha-adrenoceptor and octopamine receptor antagonist phentolamine, but not with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol.

These abnormal movements resemble drug-induced dyskinesia more closely than other rodent models.

The D2 class of dopamine receptors (DRD2, -3, and -4) is the target for antipsychotic medication. DRD4 has been implicated in cognition, and genetic studies have found an association between a highly polymorphic repeat sequence in the human DRD4 coding region and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Using DRD4 as a model, we show that antipsychotics can function as potent pharmacological chaperones up-regulating receptor expression and can also rescue a non-functional DRD4 folding mutant. This chaperone-mediated up-regulation involves reduced degradation by the 26 S proteasome; likely via the stabilization of newly synthesized receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum. Dopamine itself can function as a chaperone when shuttled into the cell by means of the dopamine transporter. Furthermore, different repeat variants of DRD4 display differential sensitivity to this chaperone effect. These data suggest that folding efficiency may be rate-limiting for dopamine receptor biogenesis and that this efficiency differs between receptor variants.

We cloned full-length rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (rhTA(1)) that was 96% homologous to human TA(1). The trace amines tyramine and beta-phenylethylamine (PEA) and the monoamine transporter substrates (+/-)-amphetamine and (+/-)-MDMA stimulated cAMP accumulation in rhTA(1)-expressing cell lines, as measured by a cAMP response element-luciferase assay. Cocaine did not stimulate cAMP accumulation in rhTA(1) cells, but it blocked [(3)H]PEA transport mediated by the dopamine transporter. Cotransfection with the human dopamine transporter enhanced PEA-, amphetamine-, and MDMA-mediated rhTA(1) receptor activation, but it diminished tyramine activation of rhTA(1). Because TA(1) (EGFP-rhTA(1) chimera) was largely intracellular, conceivably the dopamine transporter can facilitate access of specific agonists to intracellular TA(1). rhTA(1) mRNA expression was detected in rhesus monkey substantia nigra, implying that TA(1) may be colocalized with the dopamine transporter in dopamine neurons. In summary, primate TA(1) receptors are direct targets of trace amines, amphetamine, and MDMA. These receptors could also be indirect targets of amphetamine, MDMA, and cocaine through modification of monoamine transporter function. Conceivably, rhTA(1) receptors may be located on pre- or postsynaptic membranes. Interference with the carrier function of monoamine transporters with a consequent rise of extracellular levels of trace amines could activate these receptors.

In particular endogenous hypothalamic 5-HT has been implicated in the processes of within meal satiation and the end state of post meal satiety. Of the numerous 5-HT receptor subtypes currently identified, 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors are believed to mediate the 5-HT induced satiety. 5-HT drugs such as d-fenfluramine, selective serotoninergic reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) and 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists have all been shown to significantly attenuate rodent body weight gain, an effect strongly associated with marked hypophagia. D-Fenfluramine, sibutramine, fluoxetine and the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist mCPP have also all been shown to reduce caloric intake by modifying appetite in both lean and obese humans. Specifically, 5-HT drugs reduce appetite prior to and after the consumption of fixed caloric loads, and reduce pre meal appetite and caloric intake at ad libitum meals. Clinically significant weight loss over a year or more can be produced by both d-fenfluramine and sibutramine treatment, but apparently not by the SSRI fluoxetine. Treatment with the preferential 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist mCPP and the serotonin precursor 5-HTP has also been shown to produce weight loss in the obese. Issues around the actual and possible side effects of these compounds, and in the case of d-fenfluramine toxicity, have led to a search for drugs that act selectively on the CNS 5-HT receptors critical to the satiety response.

This suggests a functional interaction between hippocampus and prefrontal dopamine. The anatomical substrate for such an interaction is the intimate interconnection between the ventral hippocampus and the dopamine innervation of the mPFC. The present study yielded direct neurochemical evidence for an interaction between ventral hippocampus and prefrontal dopamine transmission in rats by demonstrating that subconvulsive stimulation of the ventral hippocampus with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA; 0.5 mug/side) activates dopamine transmission in the mPFC. Postmortem measurements revealed that bilateral NMDA stimulation of the ventral hippocampus, resulting in locomotor hyperactivity, increased the homovanillic acid/dopamine ratio, an index of dopamine transmission, in the mPFC; indices of dopamine transmission in any of five additionally examined forebrain regions (amygdala, nucleus accumbens shell/core, lateral prefrontal cortex, caudate putamen) were unaltered. In vivo microdialysis measurements in freely moving rats corroborated the suggested activation of prefrontal dopamine transmission by demonstrating that unilateral NMDA stimulation of the ventral hippocampus increased extracellular dopamine in the ipsilateral mPFC. The suggested influence of the ventral hippocampus on prefrontal dopamine may be an important mechanism for hippocampo-prefrontal interactions in normal behavioral processes. Moreover, it indicates that aberrant hippocampal activity, as found in neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia and mood disorders, may contribute to disruption of certain cognitive and emotional functions which are extremely sensitive to imbalanced prefrontal dopamine transmission.",,United States,2005,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.12.016,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15780480

We searched the genomes of several eukaryotic species for receptors similar to the mammalian trace amine (TA) receptor subfamily. We identified 18 new receptors in rodents that are orthologous to the previously known TA-receptors. Remarkably, we found 57 receptors (and 40 pseudogenes) of this type in the zebrafish (Danio rerio), while fugu (Takifugu rubripes) had only eight receptors (and seven pseudogenes). We mapped 47 of the zebrafish TA-receptors on chromosomes using radiation hybrid panels and meiotic mapping. The results, together with the degree of conservation and phylogenetic relationships displayed among the zebrafish receptors suggest that the family arose through several different mechanisms involving tetraploidization, block duplications, and local duplication events. Interestingly, these vertebrate TA-receptors do not show a close evolutionary relationship to the invertebrate TA-binding receptors in fruitfly (Drosophila melanogaster), indicating that the ability to bind TA have evolved at least twice in animal evolution. We collected in total over 100 vertebrate TA-receptor sequences, and our phylogenetic analysis shows that several TA-receptors have evolved rapidly with remarkable species variation and that the common ancestor of vertebrate TA-receptors arose before the split of the ray-finned and lobe-finned fishes. The evolutionary history of the TA-receptors is more complex than for most other GPCR families and here we suggest a mechanism by which they may have arisen.",,United States,2005,10.1016/j.ympev.2004.12.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15804416

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and ATP are cotransmitters of norepinephrine (NE) and regulate renovascular resistance. The present study analyzes sympathetic nonadrenergic neurotransmission in hypertensive (SH-SP) and normotensive (WKY) rats. In addition, adult and young hypertensive rats were compared to investigate the role of aging on sympathetic nonadrenergic cotransmission in hypertensive disease. METHODS: Pressor responses to renal nerve stimulations (RNS) and drugs were measured on isolated perfused kidneys of young (8-10 weeks) and adult (18-24 weeks) WKY, and SH-SP rats. RESULTS: RNS evoked contractions at 1 Hz were resistant to blockade by the alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine (1 microM) but abolished by the P2 receptor blocker suramin (100 microM). Compared to adult WKY, RNS-induced pressor responses were unchanged in adult SH-SP and young WKY, but significantly greater in young SH-SP rats. The NPY-Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 (1 microM) reduced phentolamine-resistant pressor responses in adult and young WKY, young SH-SP, but not in adult SH-SP rats. In contrast to WKY and young SH-SP rats, exogenously perfused NPY (0.1 microM) was unable to potentiate RNS-induced, phentolamine-resistant pressor responses in adult SH-SP rats. NE and the stable ATP analogue alpha,beta-mATP increased the perfusion pressor response more potently in adult SH-SP than in WKY rats. CONCLUSIONS: Neuronally released NPY plays a major role in potentiating RNS-induced nonadrenergic pressor responses in kidneys of WKY and young SH-SP rats. In adult SH-SP rats NPY fails to enhance these responses. In this hypertensive model ageing seems to be associated with a loss of a modulatory role of renal NPY Y1 receptors. Since pressor responses to NE and ATP are higher in SH-SP animals, functional NPY-Y1 receptor downregulation might be an adaptive mechanism.",,England,2005,10.1016/j.cardiores.2004.12.005,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15820203

The present work describes a novel molecule, 1-(5-chloro-2,4-dimethoxy-phenyl)-3-(5-methyl-isoxazol-3-yl)-urea (PNU-120596), which acts as a powerful positive allosteric modulator of the alpha7 nAChR. Discovered in a high-throughput screen, PNU-120596 increased agonist-evoked calcium flux mediated by an engineered variant of the human alpha7 nAChR. Electrophysiology studies confirmed that PNU-120596 increased peak agonist-evoked currents mediated by wild-type receptors and also demonstrated a pronounced prolongation of the evoked response in the continued presence of agonist. In contrast, PNU-120596 produced no detectable change in currents mediated by alpha4beta2, alpha3beta4, and alpha9alpha10 nAChRs. PNU-120596 increased the channel mean open time of alpha7 nAChRs but had no effect on ion selectivity and relatively little, if any, effect on unitary conductance. When applied to acute hippocampal slices, PNU-120596 increased the frequency of ACh-evoked GABAergic postsynaptic currents measured in pyramidal neurons; this effect was suppressed by TTX, suggesting that PNU-120596 modulated the function of alpha7 nAChRs located on the somatodendritic membrane of hippocampal interneurons. Accordingly, PNU-120596 greatly enhanced the ACh-evoked inward currents in these interneurons. Systemic administration of PNU-120596 to rats improved the auditory gating deficit caused by amphetamine, a model proposed to reflect a circuit level disturbance associated with schizophrenia.

The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists exert a breadth of action over a wide dose range in rodent and primate models to inhibit aversive behaviour in animal models of anxiety and certain symptoms of withdrawal from drugs of abuse, alcohol, nicotine, diazepam and cocaine, to antagonise increased locomotor activity caused by mesolimbic dopamine excess, and facilitate performance in cognitive tests. The studies reveal an important role for 5-HT3 receptors in the regulation of limbic-cortical functioning, and a critical role for 5-HT3 receptor antagonists to establish the role of 5-HT3 receptors in schizophrenia, anxiety, drug withdrawal phenomena and cognitive disturbance.

Implications for a unique clinical profile.,Meltzer HY and Gudelsky GA ,Arzneimittel-Forschung,,"The clinical profile of clozapine (CAS 5786-21-0) is characterized by superior efficacy in reducing the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and a greatly reduced propensity to elicit acute extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., Parkinsonian symptoms), long-term effects (e.g., tardive dyskinesia) and hyperprolactinemia. For these reasons clozapine is considered the prototypic atypical antipsychotic. The failure of clozapine to elevate serum prolactin concentrations may be related to the stimulatory effect of clozapine on tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurons and/or the failure of clozapine to achieve effective blockade of pituitary dopamine D2 receptors. The lack of acute blockade of striatal D2 receptors by clozapine and the failure of chronic clozapine treatment to suppress striatal dopamine release, relative to that produced by typical antipsychotic agents, may account for the lack of acute extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, respectively, associated with the use of clozapine. Although the neurochemical substrates that subserve the unique preclinical and clinical profile of clozapine have not been determined unequivocally, clozapine and other purported atypical antipsychotic agents produce a greater antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors relative to D2 receptors than is the case for typical antipsychotics. Clozapine also exerts antagonism of D1 receptors. It is proposed that the selective interaction of clozapine among D2, D1, D4 and 5-HT2 receptors results in a distinctive alteration in the function of pre- and post-synaptic dopamine elements.",,Germany,1992,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1586397

However, discontinuation of lithium treatment is followed by a high incidence of manic episodes. In the present study, we attempted to identify neurobiological changes that might mediate this rebound mania. In vivo microdialysis in the anaesthetized rat and in situ hybridization histochemistry were used to study the effect of chronic lithium treatment and withdrawal from chronic lithium treatment on presynaptic dopamine (DA) function. Rats were maintained for 28 days on a lithium diet or control diet. The lithium-withdrawn treatment group had their lithium diet substituted for control diet from day 25 of the treatment period. Microdialysis probes were implanted in the shell of the nucleus accumbens and both basal extracellular DA levels and DA levels in the presence of the DA uptake inhibitor bupropion (1 microM) were collected. Basal DA levels did not differ between any of the treatment groups. However, during local perfusion of bupropion, the increase in DA was significantly attenuated in the lithium-treated animals compared to controls or lithium-withdrawn animals. In situ hybridization of DA transporter mRNA in the ventral tegmental area revealed no difference in the abundance of this mRNA in any of the groups. These data suggest that there is impaired DA release in rats during chronic lithium treatment, but DA release returns to normal levels on withdrawal from lithium treatment, and is therefore unlikely to underlie the rebound mania associated with lithium withdrawal.",,United States,2005,10.1177/0269881105051525,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15888507

The same tests 24 h following treatment with 1.0 mg/kg HAL showed rapid tolerance to the HAL cue, sensitization to the AMPH cue, but not AMPH-like withdrawal cues. Analysis of the results showed that tolerance to the AMPH and HAL cues reflected neuroadaptive baseline shifts and not weaker cue properties.

In order to increase understanding of the neurochemical basis of such deficits, we utilized an animal model to test whether monoamine reuptake inhibition and nicotine receptor antagonism reduce the amplitude and gating of the P20 and N40 auditory components. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice received 12 days of chronic vehicle, bupropion, haloperidol or bupropion plus haloperidol. Auditory evoked potentials were then recorded in alert mice to measure the amplitude and gating of evoked components during a paired click paradigm similar to tasks used to measure the P50 and N100 auditory potentials in schizophrenia. Evoked potentials were recorded prior to and following acute nicotine. RESULTS: Bupropion reduced the amplitude and gating of the N40 evoked potential in mice, similar to the P50 and N100 endophenotypes associated with sensory encoding deficits in schizophrenia. This deficit was fully reversed only by the combination of haloperidol and nicotine, suggesting that dopamine reuptake inhibition and nicotine antagonism both contribute to the observed phenotype. Furthermore, nicotine increased P20 amplitude across all groups supporting a role for nicotine agonists in pre-attentive sensory encoding deficits.

To further our understanding of the neural systems associated with increases in anxiety states, we investigated the effects of multiple anxiogenic drugs on topographically organized subpopulations of serotonergic neurons using double immunohistochemical staining for c-Fos and tryptophan hydroxylase combined with topographical analysis of the rat dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). Anxiogenic drugs with diverse pharmacological properties including the adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine, the serotonin 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist m-chlorophenyl piperazine (mCPP), the alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine, and the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) induced increases in behavioral arousal and vigilance behaviors consistent with an increase in anxiety state. In addition, these anxiogenic drugs, excluding yohimbine, had convergent actions on an anatomically-defined subset of serotonergic neurons within the middle and caudal, dorsal subdivision of the DR. High resolution topographical analysis revealed that at the mid-rostrocaudal level, caffeine and FG-7142 had convergent effects on c-Fos expression in serotonergic neurons that were restricted to a previously undefined region, which we have named the shell region of the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRDSh), that overlaps the anatomical border between the dorsal part of the dorsal raphe nucleus, the ventral part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRV), and the ventrolateral part of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRVL). Retrograde tracing methods revealed that DRDSh contains large numbers of neurons projecting to the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, a forebrain structure important for emotional appraisal and modulation of anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses. Together these findings support the hypothesis that there is a functional topographical organization in the DR and are consistent with the hypothesis that anxiogenic drugs have selective actions on a subpopulation of serotonergic neurons projecting to a distributed central autonomic and emotional motor control system regulating anxiety states and anxiety-related physiological and behavioral responses.",,United States,2005,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.03.025,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15916857

The efficacy of antidepressant action was associated with several polymorphisms, located on coding genes of proteins thought to be involved in the different mechanisms of action of antidepressant treatments. Among these, gene variants in sequences of serotonin pathway proteins were candidate, both for the well known evidence of its involvement in the development of depressive symptomathology and for the wide-world use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first choice treatment of depression. A polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter (SERTPR) was independently associated with efficacy for a range of treatments, other polymorphism located on the tryptophan hydroxylase gene, 5-HT2a receptor and G-protein beta 3 showed some association, while other candidate genes were not associated with treatment efficacy.

Within the eye serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) appears to have a variety of effects, it alters retinal amacrine cell processing, increases intraocular pressure, constricts ocular blood vessels, and is also mitogenic. This study sought to determine the role of the retinal serotonin system in eye growth regulation. Myopia was produced in 7-day-old chicks using -15 D spectacle lenses (LIM) and form deprivation (FDM). The effect on LIM and FDM of daily intravitreal injections of a combination of 5-HT receptor antagonists (1, 10, 50 microM), 5-HT(2) selective antagonist (Mianserin 0.5, 20 microM) or 5-HT (1, 10, 50 microM) were assessed. Counts were performed of serotonin and tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons and the relative density used to account for areal changes due to eye growth. The effect of LIM and lens-induced hyperopia (LIH) on the numbers of 5-HT-containing amacrine cells in the retina were then determined. The combination of 5-HT receptor antagonists inhibited LIM by approximately half (1 microM RE: -7.12+/-1.0 D, AL: 0.38+/-0.06 mm vs. saline RE: -13.19+/-0.65 D, AL: 0.64+/-0.03 mm.

During haloperidol-induced bradykinesia (mean movement time increase, +231%), there was an average 11% decrease in baseline firing rate. Movement-related peaks in firing rate were more dramatically affected, with an overall reduction in peak amplitudes of 40%. Bradykinesia was also associated with decreased intensity of bursting and amplitude of cross-correlation peaks at rest. The results show for the first time that significant reductions can be detected in motor cortex activity at rest in animals with impaired ability to generate movements induced by reduced dopamine action and confirm that impaired movements are associated with reduced cortical activation. Together, these changes in neural activity may reduce recruitment and rate modulation of motor units in the spinal cord.",,United States,2005,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0523-05.2005,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15958736

Elucidation of the neural processes mediating sensitization may therefore lead to the development of new pharmacotherapeutic treatments. A large number of studies have examined sensitization to psychostimulants and morphine. In contrast, despite the prevalence of alcoholism, the neural processes underlying sensitization to ethanol have not been identified. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of different components of the dopamine system in sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of ethanol in DBA/2J mice. Sensitization was induced by administering ethanol [2 g/kg intraperitoneally (ip)] before locomotor activity trials. Control groups received saline (12.5 ml/kg ip) before each activity trial. The ability of the dopamine uptake inhibitors GBR 12909 (3.33-10.0 mg/kg) and bupropion (20 and 30 mg/kg) to cross-sensitize to ethanol was then examined. In addition, the effects of SKF 82958 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), a dopamine D(1) (D(1)) receptor agonist, quinpirole (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), a dopamine D(2)/D(3) (D(2)/D(3)) receptor agonist, and a combination of SKF 82958 and quinpirole were examined. Cross-sensitization was observed between the dopamine uptake inhibitor GBR 12909 and ethanol. In contrast, the less selective uptake inhibitor bupropion did not exhibit cross-sensitization. Similarly, stimulation of D(1) and D(2)/D(3) receptors did not cause cross-sensitization even when the agonists were administered together. Taken together, these data suggest that sensitization to ethanol is associated with changes in the dopaminergic system.",,United States,2005,10.1016/j.alcohol.2005.03.006,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-15963427

Such activity is associated with enhanced treatment of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, which may be mediated by modulation of cerebral dopamine and serotonin levels. We employed microdialysis coupled to high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to examine 5-HT1A receptor activation in the modulation of extracellular dopamine in medial prefrontal cortex and serotonin in hippocampus of freely moving rats. The above compounds were compared with drugs that have less interaction with 5-HT1A receptors (clozapine, nemonapride, ziprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol). Hippocampal 5-HT was decreased by bifeprunox, SSR181507, SLV313, sarizotan, and nemonapride, effects similar to those seen with the 5-HT1A agonist, (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin [(+)8-OH-DPAT], consistent with activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors.

In contrast, the increases in dopamine levels induced by clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone were not blocked by WAY100635, consistent with predominant influence of other mechanisms in the actions of these drugs. Haloperidol, nemonapride, and the D2 partial agonists, aripiprazole and bifeprunox, did not significantly alter dopamine release.

Involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in these effects has been suggested. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to study the effects of ketamine on extrastriatal dopamine receptor availability in healthy subjects and extracellular dopamine levels in rat cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of computer-driven subanesthetic ketamine infusion on cortical dopamine release was studied in healthy male subjects using a controlled study design. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]FLB 457. A conventional region of interest-based analysis and voxel-based analysis was applied to the PET data. The ketamine-induced cortical dopamine release in rats was studied using in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion reduced significantly the [11C]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortices, suggestive of increased dopamine release. This brain imaging finding was further supported by a microdialysis experiment in rats showing that ketamine increased the extracellular dopamine concentration by up to 200% in the retrosplenial cortex. Ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms were associated with changes in the [11C]FLB 457 BP in the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cortical dopaminergic mechanisms have a role in the emergence of ketamine-induced psychosis-like symptoms in man. The glutamate-dopamine interaction in the posterior cingulate during ketamine infusion is well in line with the recent functional and structural imaging studies suggesting involvement of this cortical area in the development of schizophrenic psychosis.",,Germany,2005,10.1007/s00213-005-0092-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16001106

This work examines data consistent with the hypothesis, specific to genetic and kinetic differences of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT), as they may be linked to divergent antidepressant response (ADR). The mechanisms for divergent ADR in association with different initial SERT function are considered within the context of SERT trafficking as sensitive to various different kinase and cytokine signals, some of which are dependent on the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism of the SERT gene. Pilot data suggest that human lymphocytes show kinase changes similar to those found in rat brain with ADT. These studies additionally suggest that ADT prompts a shift in cytokine gene expression toward a greater anti-inflammatory/inflammatory ratio. These latter findings are discussed within the context of a literature suggesting increased inflammatory cytokine levels in depression, and recent observations of increased temperature associated with depression. In sum, the data suggest the opportunity to identify response dependent protein (RDP) expression patterns that may differ with dichotomous ADR, and suggest new insights into understanding the mechanisms of psychotropic drug response through an understanding of initial differences in potential for psychotropic drug target regulation during therapy.",,England,2005,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2005.03.011,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16005136

This laboratory previously identified a correlation between striatal vesicular DA uptake through VMAT-2 and inhibition of the DA transporter (DAT). For example, administration of methylphenidate (MPD), a DAT inhibitor, increases vesicular DA uptake through VMAT-2 in a purified vesicular preparation; an effect associated with a redistribution of VMAT-2 protein within DA terminals. The purpose of this study was to determine if other DAT inhibitors, including bupropion, similarly affect VMAT-2. Results revealed bupropion rapidly, reversibly, and dose-dependently increased vesicular DA uptake; an effect also associated with VMAT-2 protein redistribution. The bupropion-induced increase in vesicular DA uptake was prevented by pretreatment with eticlopride, a DA D2 receptor antagonist, but not by SCH23390, a DA D1 receptor antagonist. We previously reported that MPD post-treatment prevents persistent DA deficits associated with multiple methamphetamine (METH) administrations. Although bupropion attenuated the METH-induced reduction in VMAT-2 activity acutely, it did not prevent the long-term dopaminergic toxicity or the METH-induced redistribution of VMAT-2 protein.

In addition to a series of excitatory effects, acetylcholine decreases the release of glutamate acting on presynaptic muscarinic receptors. By recording evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in layers II/III neurons of the auditory cortex, we found that activation of muscarinic receptors by oxotremorine reduces the amplitude of glutamatergic current (A(oxo)/A(ctr) = 0.53 +/- 0.17) in the absence but not in the presence of dopamine (A(oxo)/A(ctr) = 0.89 +/- 0.12 in 20 microM dopamine). These data suggested that an excessive sensitivity to dopamine, such as postulated in schizophrenia, could prevent the decrease of glutamate release associated with the activation of cholinergic corticopetal nuclei. Thus, a possible mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs could be through a depression of the glutamatergic signal in the auditory cortex. We tested the capability of haloperidol, clozapine and lamotrigine to affect glutamatergic synaptic currents and their muscarinic modulation. We found that antipsychotics not only work as dopamine receptor antagonists in re-establishing muscarinic modulation, but also directly depress glutamatergic currents.

DEVELOPMENT: MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.

Importantly, canonical cAMP-mediated dopamine-receptor signaling is not inhibited in the absence of beta-arrestin 2. These results demonstrate that, apart from its classical function in receptor desensitization, beta-arrestin 2 also acts as a signaling intermediate through a kinase/phosphatase scaffold.

For exogenously administered monoamines, anticonvulsant activity was only observed following 70--400% and 80--350% increases in baseline levels for dopamine and serotonin, respectively. The aim of the present microdialysis study was to investigate whether oxcarbazepine and its active metabolite, 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (MHD) promote the release of hippocampal monoamines. Initially, concentration-response experiments were performed. Different concentrations of both compounds were perfused into the hippocampus via the microdialysis probe and tested for their effects on extracellular monoamine levels and anticonvulsant properties against pilocarpine-evoked seizures in rats. Anticonvulsant activity was always accompanied by significant increases in dopamine and serotonin levels. The anticonvulsant threshold concentrations for oxcarbazepine (100 microM) and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (250 microM) were associated with, respectively, 140 and 205% increases in hippocampal dopamine and 288 and 176% increases in serotonin concentrations. Co-perfusion of these anticonvulsant threshold concentrations for both compounds either with a selective D(2) or 5-HT(1A) antagonist abolished all anticonvulsant effects. This study shows that oxcarbazepine and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine exert important monoamine promoting effects that, at least partly, contribute to the anticonvulsant mechanism of action of these compounds. The effects on dopamine and serotonin levels are therefore proposed as pharmacodynamic markers for the anticonvulsant activity of these compounds.

The [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine binding at equilibrium is saturable and is temperature- and Na(+)-dependent. The number of specific [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine binding sites (Bmax = 356 +/- 20 fmol/mg protein) is similar to that of [3H]citalopram (329 +/- 30 fmol/mg protein), a known serotonin uptake inhibitor. The binding of [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine is selectively inhibited by several serotonin uptake blockers, and a good correlation is demonstrated between the potency of various drugs to inhibit in vitro binding of [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine and [3H]citalopram. In addition, lesions performed with the neurotoxin p-chloroamphetamine, which destroys monoamine neurons, including serotonergic neuronal system, result in a 90% reduction of [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine binding when compared to sham controls. These results indicate that the binding sites labeled by [125I]R-4-iodotomoxetine are associated with the neuronal serotonin uptake sites. However, the in vivo and ex vivo results do not show regional localization corresponding to the distribution of serotonin uptake sites.

Recently, several groups have demonstrated that amphetamine-induced DA release is increased in schizophrenia, providing direct evidence for dysregulation of DA systems in this condition. In healthy volunteers, pretreatment with the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine increases amphetamine-induced DA release to levels similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia. Therefore, the dysregulation of DA function observed in schizophrenia might be secondary to NMDA hypofunction. In this study, the regulation of this response by glutamate (GLU) transmission was further characterized by using a metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor group II agonist to inhibit GLU transmission. The amphetamine- (0.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.)) induced decrease in [11C]raclopride equilibrium-specific binding (V3'') was measured under control conditions and following pretreatment with the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY354740 (20 mg/kg i.v.) in four baboons. Amphetamine reduced [11C]raclopride V3'' by 28+/-7% under control conditions. Following LY354740 pretreatment, amphetamine-induced reduction in [11C]raclopride V3'' was significantly enhanced (35+/-7%, p=0.002). The enhancement of the amphetamine-induced reduction in [11C]raclopride V3'' by LY354740 was not a simple additive effect, as LY354740 alone did not reduce [11C]raclopride V3''. In conclusion, the results of this study further document the involvement of GLU transmission in regulating the effect of amphetamine-induced DA release, and provide additional support to the hypothesis that the dysregulation of DA function revealed by the amphetamine challenge in schizophrenia might stem from a deficit in GLU transmission.",,England,2006,10.1038/sj.npp.1300902,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16177807

METHODS: Because of continuously increasing evidence for a neuromodulatory role of endocannabinoids in dopamine-related pathophysiological responses, we assessed endocannabinoid signaling in DAT KO mice and evaluated the ability of endocannabinoid ligands to normalize behavioral deficits, namely spontaneous hyperlocomotion in these mice. RESULTS: In DAT KO mice, we found markedly reduced anandamide levels, specifically in striatum, the dopamine nerve terminal region. Furthermore, three distinct indirect endocannabinoid agonists, the selective anandamide reuptake inhibitors AM404 and VDM11 and the fatty acid amidohydrolase inhibitor AA5HT, attenuated spontaneous hyperlocomotion in DAT KO mice. The hypolocomotor effects of AM404, VDM11, and AA5HT were significantly attenuated by co-administration of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) antagonist capsazepine but not the selective cannabinoid type 1 (CB1)receptor antagonist AM251. Interestingly, TRPV1 binding was increased in the striatum of DAT KO mice, while CB1 receptor binding was unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate a dysregulated striatal endocannabinoid neurotransmission associated with hyperdopaminergic state. Restoring endocannabinoid homeostasis in active synapses might constitute an alternative therapeutic strategy for disorders associated with hyperdopaminergia. In this process, TRPV1 receptors seem to play a key role and represent a novel promising pharmacological target.",,United States,2006,10.1016/j.biopsych.2005.08.019,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16199010

Based on the remarkable progress in technologies that allow the alteration or elimination of individual genes to create transgenic animal models, gene knockout strategies further increase our knowledge about which serotonergic gene products are involved in behavioural traits. This overview selects anxiety and aggression as paradigmatic traits and behaviours, and focuses on mouse models which have been modified by deletion of genes coding for key players of serotonergic neurotransmission. In particular, phenotypic changes in mice bearing inactivation mutations of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, 5-HT transporter, 5-HT neuron-specific transcription factor Pet1, monoamine oxidase A and genes related to 5-HT signalling will be discussed and major findings highlighted. However, because a missing gene might affect many developmental processes throughout ontogeny and compensatory mechanisms may be activated in knockouts, behavioural data from mice with targeted gene deletions should be interpreted with caution. The development of conditional knockout mice, in which a specific gene can be inactivated neurocircuit-specifically at any time, is therefore likely to avert the deficiencies associated with behavioural data from classical constitutive knockouts.",,England,2005,,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16206878

The aim of the present study was to investigate prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle, locomotor hyperactivity and dopamine D2 receptor binding in mice deficient in the alpha subunit of G(z). METHODS: We used automated startle boxes to assess startle and PPI after treatment with saline, amphetamine, apomorphine or MK-801. We used photocell cages to quantitate locomotor activity after amphetamine treatment. Dopamine D2 receptor density was determined by autoradiography. RESULTS: Startle responses and baseline PPI were not different between the Galpha(z) knockout mice and wild-type controls (average PPI 46+/-4 vs 49+/-3%, respectively). Amphetamine treatment caused a marked disruption of PPI in Galpha(z) knockouts (average PPI 22+/-2%), but less so in controls (average PPI 42+/-3%). Similar genotype-dependent responses were seen after apomorphine treatment (average PPI 23+/-3% vs 40+/-3%), but not after MK-801 treatment (average PPI 29+/-5 vs 33+/-2%). Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was greater in Galpha(z) knockouts than in controls. There was no difference in the density of dopamine D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: Mice deficient in the alpha subunit of G(z) show enhanced sensitivity to the disruption of PPI and locomotor hyperactivity caused by dopaminergic stimulation.

Changes in synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) may contribute to circuit modification induced by many drugs of abuse, including cocaine. Here we report that, following repeated exposure to cocaine in vivo, excitatory synapses to rat VTA dopamine neurons become highly susceptible to the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) by correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity. This facilitated LTP induction is caused by cocaine-induced reduction of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor-mediated inhibition of these dopamine neurons. In midbrain slices from rats treated with saline or a single dose of cocaine, LTP could not be induced in VTA dopamine neurons unless GABA-mediated inhibition was reduced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. However, LTP became readily inducible in slices from rats treated repeatedly with cocaine; this LTP induction was prevented by enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition using diazepam. Furthermore, repeated cocaine exposure reduced the amplitude of GABA-mediated synaptic currents and increased the probability of spike initiation in VTA dopamine neurons. This cocaine-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the VTA may be important for the formation of drug-associated memory.",,England,2005,10.1038/nature04050,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16222299

DESIGN AND METHODS: Expanded (10% bw) and non-expanded anaesthetized male Wistar rats were treated with haloperidol, a DA receptor antagonist (3 mg/kg bw, ip). Mean arterial pressure, diuresis, natriuresis, renal plasma flow, glomerular filtration rate, nitrites and nitrates excretion (NOx) were determined. NADPH diaphorase activity was measured using a histochemistry technique in kidney, aorta and renal arteries. NOS activity in kidney and aorta from expanded and non-expanded animals was determined with L-[U14C]-arginine substrate, in basal conditions and after DA (1 microM) administration. RESULTS: The hypotensive effect of L-arg and hypertension induced by L-NAME were not modified by haloperidol. This blocker reverted the increase in diuresis, natriuresis and RPF induced by L-arg in both groups. Dopaminergic blockade induced a decrease in NOx excretion and in NADPH-diaphorase activity in glomeruli, proximal tubule and medullar collecting duct and in endothelium and vascular smooth muscle of renal arteries. DA induced an increase in NOS activity in renal medulla and cortex in both groups, but no changes in the aorta were observed.

As a selective norepinephrine uptake inhibitor and a nonstimulant, atomoxetine has a different mechanism of action from the stimulant drugs used up to now for the treatment of ADHD. Since brain acetylcholine (ACh) has been associated with memory, attention and motivation, processes dysregulated in ADHD, we investigated the effects of atomoxetine on cholinergic neurotransmission. We showed here that, in rats, atomoxetine (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.),--increases in vivo extracellular levels of ACh in cortical but not subcortical brain regions. The marked increase of cortical ACh induced by atomoxetine was dependent upon norepinephrine alpha-1 and/or dopamine D1 receptor activation. We observed similar increases in cortical and hippocampal ACh release with methylphenidate (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.)--currently the most commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of ADHD--and with the norepinephrine uptake inhibitor reboxetine (3-30 mg/kg, i.p.). Since drugs that increase cholinergic neurotransmission are used in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and dementias, we also investigated the effects of atomoxetine on memory tasks.

Long-term treatment with the antipanic compound imipramine enhances the DPAG 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A-receptor-mediated inhibition of escape, implicating these receptors in the mode of action of panicolytic drugs. OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we investigated whether the inhibitory effect on escape elicited by the intra-DPAG injection of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor agonists is also enhanced after treatment with fluoxetine, another widely used antipanic drug. The effects of fluoxetine were compared to those of buspirone, an anxiolytic drug without major effect on panic disorder. METHODS: Male Wistar rats, subchronically (3-6 days) or chronically (21-24 days) treated with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) or chronically treated with buspirone (0.3 mg/kg i.p.), were intra-DPAG injected with 5-HT (20 nmol), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 8 nmol) or the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl) piperazine dihydrochloride (DOI; 16 nmol). The intensity of electrical current that applied to the DPAG-evoked escape behavior was measured before and after the microinjection of these agonists. RESULTS: The electrical current necessary to produce escape was increased after the microinjection of the three 5-HT receptor agonists in all groups of animals tested. However, this panicolytic-like effect was significantly higher in animals receiving long-term treatment with fluoxetine.

Advances in molecular biology have led to the identification and cloning of important peripheral and central weight regulating peptides. Weight gain as a consequence of antipsychotic use is increasingly being recognized as a serious clinical issue. The weight regulation system provides a framework upon which antipsychotics exert their weight-inducing effects. Some studies have sought, with inconsistent results, to establish associations between antipsychotic use and levels of weight regulating mediators. The receptor pharmacology of antipsychotics known to increase weight can be studied with a view to establishing genetic variants contributing to the risk.

57c1476d-3ace-4c4b-bf32-49f403ef4665,Alcohol dependence and gene x environment interaction in emotion regulation: Is serotonin the link?,Lesch KP ,European journal of pharmacology,,"Alcohol dependence is characterized by frequent, compulsive and uncontrolled consumption of alcohol associated with behavior of maladaption and destruction. It is an etiologically and clinically heterogeneous syndrome, moderately to highly heritable, and caused by interaction of genes and environment. Alcohol dependence is related to other psychiatric diseases by common neurobiological pathways, including those that modulate reward, behavioral control as well as anxiety and stress response. Alcohol induces adaptive changes in brain function providing the basis for tolerance, craving, withdrawal, and emotional disturbance. The differentiation of psychobiological traits of addictive behavior reflecting neurobiological processes is therefore of particular importance for the dissection of the complex genetic susceptibility to alcohol dependence. A central serotonin (5-HT) deficit is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence by modulating motivational behavior, neuroadaptive processes, and resulting emotional disturbance. 5-HT-related impulsive, aggressive, and suicidal behavior has been linked to a primordial personality that is susceptible to alcohol dependence. Although variations in many of the genes that encode receptors, enzymes, and transporters of the 5-HT system have been tested as risk factors for alcohol dependence, genetic analyses of 5-HT signaling in alcohol dependence have mainly been focused on the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) gene. Due to its central role in the fine-tuning serotonergic neurotransmission, a regulatory variant of the 5-HTT, which is associated with anxiety related traits, is not only a key player in the neurobiological mechanism of gene x environment interaction in the etiology of depression, but also contributes to the risk to develop alcohol dependence with antisocial behavior and suicidality. Evidence for a modulatory effect of allelic variation of 5-HTT function on limbic circuit responses to emotional stimuli suggests that genotype-endophenotype correlations may be accessible to molecular functional imaging of the brain. These new developments have broad implications for our understanding how genetic vulnerability to alcohol dependence is manifested in the brain's response to emotional stimuli.",,Netherlands,2005,10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.09.027,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16288736

The excitotoxicity associated with direct NMDA receptor agonists limits their therapeutic potential, and the glycine modulatory site of the NMDA receptor has received growing interest as a therapeutic target. One approach to enhance NMDA receptor function is to increase the availability of the necessary co-agonist glycine at this modulatory site through inhibition of glycine reuptake from the synapse via glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1). Both preclinical and clinical evidence provide support for this approach, as do recent findings demonstrating the regulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission by GlyT1 inhibition. As a result, several groups have focused on the development of novel GlyT1 inhibitors. In addition, recent electrophysiological findings and data from transgenic mouse models suggest that GlyT1 might also play a role in terminating the actions of glycine at strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, and therefore GlyT1 antagonists also have potential for the treatment of conditions where activation of inhibitory pathways in the central nervous system might be beneficial.",,England,2006,10.1016/j.coph.2005.11.002,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16376148

Repeated treatment with milnacipran (30 mg/kg, i.p. after 30 mg/kg, p.o. x 14 days) completely restored the suppression of the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by single milnacipran treatment (30 mg/kg, i.p.).

Single milnacipran increased extracellular 5-HT and this effect tended to be enhanced by repeated treatment.

Many studies of the relationships between brain serotonergic functions and affective disorders have been performed in different animal models. In this study, brain regional 5-HT synthesis was examined using the alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-MTrp) autoradiographic method in a genetic rat model of depression, Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, and was compared to both the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats and the control Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The plasma concentration of free tryptophan in the FSL rats was not significantly different (p > 0.05; ANOVA and post-hoc Bonferroni correction) when compared to that of the FRL and SD rats. The FSL rats had significantly lower 5-HT synthesis (one sample two-tailed t-test on the ratio) than both the FRL and SD rats (the mean ratios were 0.78 +/- 0.12 and 0.73 +/- 0.15, respectively). Overall, the 5-HT synthesis in the FRL rats was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that in the SD rats (one sample two-tailed t-test on the ratio and the mean ratio was 0.93 +/- 0.13). Studies of individual brain structures, such as the raphe nuclei and their many terminal areas, including the nucleus accumbens, cingulate and frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus revealed significant reductions (typically 25-50%) in 5-HT synthesis in the FSL rats compared to the non-depressive FRL and SD rats. These results suggest that significantly reduced 5-HT synthesis in the raphe nuclei and limbic areas in FSL rats may contribute to their depressive features.",,England,2006,10.1016/j.neuint.2005.11.012,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16427159

In the treatment of major depression, recent clinical studies indicate that the pharmacological profiles of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine are correlated with the ability of these drugs to increase the brain and cerebrospinal fluid content of allopregnanolone (Allo), a potent positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action at GABAA receptors. Thus, the neurosteroid-induced positive allosteric modulation of GABA action at GABAA receptors is facilitated by fluoxetine or its congeners (i.e., paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), which may not block 5-HT reuptake at the doses currently prescribed in the clinic. However, these doses are effective in the treatment of premenstrual dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. In socially isolated mice, we tested the hypothesis that fluoxetine, norfluoxetine, and other specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) congeners stereoselectively upregulate neurosteroid content at doses insufficient to inhibit 5-HT reuptake; although they potentiate pentobarbital-induced sedation and exert antiaggressive action. Very importantly, the inhibition of 5-HT reuptake lacks stereospecificity and requires fluoxetine and norfluoxetine doses that are 50-fold greater than those required to increase brain Allo content, potentiate the action of pentobarbital, or antagonize isolation-induced aggression. Based on these findings, it could be inferred that the increase of brain Allo content elicited by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine, rather than the inhibition selective of 5-HT reuptake, may be operative in the fluoxetine-induced remission of the behavioral abnormalities associated with mood disorders. Therefore, the term ""SSRI"" may be misleading in defining the pharmacological profile of fluoxetine and its congeners. To this extent, the term ""selective brain steroidogenic stimulants"" (SBSSs) could be proposed.",,Germany,2006,10.1007/s00213-005-0213-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16432684
832d7aa0-1a78-4e06-b857-f0285d156a0a,[Mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs: importance of genetically modified mice in the pharmacological in vivo approach].,Gardier A ,Therapie,,"The main hypothesis regarding the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs is monoaminergic and mainly involves two neurotransmitters, serotonin and noradrenaline. Despite the well-recognized therapeutic efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), some disadvantages still occur. For example, they often require 4-6 weeks to achieve clinical benefits in depressed patients. In the past, some molecules that could shorten this long delay of action have been identified. The role of presynaptic autoreceptors - the activation of which leads to an inhibitory feedback control on neurotransmitter synthesis and release - has been extensively studied for antidepressant effects. In our laboratory, we studied the combined effects of an SSRI and a serotonin autoreceptor antagonist of the 5-HT1B subtype using intracerebral in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving mice. Important information on SSRIs has been obtained by applying this technique to genetically modified animals, such as constitutive knockout (KO) mice lacking 5-HT1B receptors (5-HT1B KO) generated by homologous recombination: we compared the effects of a combined treatment on extracellular/intrasynaptic levels of serotonin in various nerve terminals area in wild-type control and KO mice. Thus, we found that indirect activation of 5-HT1B autoreceptors limits the effects of SSRIs on dialysate 5-HT levels at serotonergic nerve terminals such as the ventral hippocampus. The study of substance P (neurokinin 1 receptor [R-NK1]) offers another example of the use of KO mice in the development of a new class of antidepressant drugs. NK1 receptor antagonists may display anxiolytic/antidepressant-like properties. The lack of selective compounds for each tachykinin receptor subtype (R-NK 1, R-NK2 or R-NK3) and differences in their affinity between animal species have made R-NK1 KO mice a very useful experimental tool. In collaborative work we found that genetic (R-NK1 KO mice) or pharmacological (GR205171) blockade of R-NK1 is associated with several changes: the increase in cortical 5-HT outflow caused by systemic injection of paroxetine was 4- to 6-fold higher in freely moving R-NK1 KO mice than in wild-type controls. The constitutive lack of NK1 receptors is associated with a functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, resembling that induced by chronic treatment with SSRI antidepressants. These results highlight the link between a neurotransmitter (serotonin) and a neuropeptide (substance P). This genetic strategy allowed us to point out that multiple targets participate to the effects of classical antidepressant drugs within the brain. We hope that, soon, some mice lines (constitutive or tissue specific, conditional rescue mice having alterations of sleep/wakefulness and/or food intake, altered central serotonin and/or noradrenaline neurotransmission, deficit in neurotrophic factors, but increases in intrasynaptic concentrations of substance P) could be a relevant model of the physiopathology of depressive disorders, and could help us understand the appearance of some symptoms. These recent findings suggest that instead of being rejected, the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression should be improved, corrected and completed by studying the role of other neurotransmitter, neuromodulatory compounds (substance P, BDNF [brain-derived neurotrophic factor]). By doing so, it thus could be possible to improve antidepressant drug treatment, i.e. shorten their long delay of action and/or to decrease treatment resistance or improve its tolerance.",,France,2005,10.2515/therapie:2005067,English Abstract and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16433012

However, the etiology of SZ is still largely unknown. It is believed that molecules that are in an association with the etiology and pathology of SZ are neurotransmitters including dopamine, 5-HT and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). But several lines of evidences indicate that potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel, known as BK channel, is likely to be included. BK channel belongs to a group of ion channels that plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and transmitter releasing. Its involvement in SZ emerges as a great interest. For example, commonly used neuroleptics, in clinical therapeutic concentrations, alter calcium-activated potassium conductance in central neurons. Diazoxide, a potassium channel opener/activator, showed a significant superiority over haloperidol alone in the treatment of positive and general psychopathology symptoms in SZ. Additionally, estrogen, which regulates the activity of BK channel, modulates dopaminergic D2 receptor and has an antipsychotic-like effect. Therefore, we hypothesize that BK channel may play a role in SZ and those agents, which can target either BK channel functions or its expression may contribute to the therapeutic actions of SZ treatment.",,United States,2006,10.1016/j.mehy.2005.09.055,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16446048

Since there is reciprocal modulation between the locus coeruleus and the dorsal raphe nucleus, and because these structures are associated with the pathophysiology of different states of anxiety, we evaluated the activity of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons from early malnourished animals compared with controls, using in vivo extracellular single-unit recordings. The number of spontaneously active cells/track was significantly higher in protein-deprived animals, although the firing rate and the sensitivity of 5-HT(1A) receptors did not differ from those of controls. Five days of fluoxetine administration (5 mg/kg/day i.p.) was able to reverse the increased number of active serotonergic cells without affecting their firing rate. Furthermore, subsensitivity of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors developed in the same way after repeated fluoxetine administration in both control and protein-deprived animals. These results suggest that the increased noradrenergic transmission observed in protein-deprived animals may induce an activation of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, and that this effect is normalized following fluoxetine treatment, which normalizes locus coeruleus activity.",,Netherlands,2006,10.1016/j.ejphar.2005.11.040,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16472801

Two major targets of these afferents are the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Whereas dopamine (DA) in the mPFC has been implicated in working memory and attentional processes, DA in the NAc is required for responding to reward predictive cues. These distinct functions suggest a role for independent firing patterns of dopaminergic neurons projecting to these brain regions. In fact, DA release in mPFC and NAc can be differentially modulated. However, to date, electrophysiological studies have largely overlooked heterogeneity among VTA neurons. Here, we provide direct evidence for differential neurotransmitter control of DA neural activity and corresponding DA release based on projection target. Kappa opioid receptor agonists inhibit VTA DA neurons that project to the mPFC but not those that project to the NAc. Moreover, DA levels in the mPFC, but not the NAc, are reduced after local infusion of kappa opioid receptor agonists into the VTA. These findings demonstrate that DA release in specific brain regions can be independently regulated by opioid targeting of a subpopulation of VTA DA neurons. Selective control of VTA DA neurons projecting to the mPFC has important implications for understanding addiction, attention disorders, and schizophrenia, all of which are associated with DA dysfunction in the mPFC.",,United States,2006,10.1073/pnas.0511159103,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16477003

Previous drug discrimination studies in rats have shown that a 1.25 mg/kg clozapine training dose provides full stimulus generalization (i.e.) >or=80% condition-appropriate responding) to most atypical antipsychotic drugs, although a 5.0 mg/kg clozapine training dose appears necessary to provide stimulus generalization to other atypical antipsychotic drugs. The present study sought to characterize the pharmacological mechanisms that mediate these clozapine training doses. In rats trained to discriminate 1.25 vs. 5.0 mg/kg clozapine vs. vehicle in a three-choice drug discrimination task, various receptor-selective compounds were tested for stimulus generalization. The antidepressant mianserin was also tested. Full stimulus generalization from the 1.25 mg/kg clozapine training dose occurred only to mianserin (98.8%). Partial substitution (i.e. >or=60% and <80% condition-appropriate responding) to the 5.0 mg/kg clozapine training dose occurred for the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine. The combined total percentage of responding on the 1.25 and 5.0 mg/kg clozapine levers, however, was well above the full substitution criteria at the 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg scopolamine doses.

These results are consistent with previous evidence that antidepressant drugs have a tendency to substitute for clozapine and that muscarinic receptor antagonism may mediate the discriminative stimulus properties of 5.0 mg/kg clozapine. The lack of stimulus generalization from either clozapine training dose to other receptor-selective compounds, however, fails to explain how this model screens atypical from typical antipsychotic drugs and suggests that the discriminative stimulus properties of clozapine consist of a compound cue.",,England,2006,10.1097/01.fbp.0000197457.70774.91,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16495726

The behavioral and psychopathological manifestations of central dopaminergic dysfunction differ depending on the site of their neurobiological correlate. These sites may be found in the dorsal or ventral striatum, but also in cortical regions such as the limbic and prefrontal cortex, among other locations. A low basic dopamine turnover and an increase in the availability of dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate body have been associated with the severity of motor tics in Tourette's syndrome. In the ventral striatum and particularly in the nucleus accumbens, different drugs of abuse stimulate dopamine release and thus reinforce drug consumption. The downregulation of dopamine D2 receptors in this area of the brain has been associated with alcohol craving and an increase in the processing of alcohol-related stimuli in the medial prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies in which intrasynaptic dopamine release is manipulated in vivo have shown that increased subcortical dopamine release is associated with the pathogenesis of positive symptoms in schizophrenia. This review discusses a broad range of brain imaging and neuroendocrinological studies on dopaminergic dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders, including relevant findings on the basis of primate studies.

Many factors have been implicated; however, there has been great interest in the potent pulmonary vasoconstrictor serotonin (5-HT) due to episodes of primary pulmonary hypertension in humans triggered by serotoninergic appetite-suppressant drugs. Pulmonary hypertensive patients have elevated blood 5-HT levels and pulmonary vasoconstriction induced by 5-HT is believed to be mediated through 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2A receptors that are expressed by pulmonary smooth muscle cells. The vascular remodeling associated with pulmonary hypertension also appears to require the serotonin transporter. We investigated the roles of 5-HT receptor blockers on the development of pulmonary hypertension induced by infusing 5-HT i.v. in broilers. For this purpose, we treated broilers with the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 mg/ kg of BW) or with the nonselective 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (3 mg/kg of BW). Receptor blockade was followed by infusion of 5-HT while recording pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary arterial blood flow. The results demonstrate that methiothepin, but not ketanserin, eliminated the 5-HT-induced pulmonary hypertensive responses in broilers. The 5-HT2A receptor does not, therefore, appear to play a role in the 5-HT-induced pulmonary hypertensive responses in broilers. Methiothepin did not inhibit pulmonary vascular contractility per se, because the pulmonary hypertensive response to the thromboxane A2 mimetic U44069 remained intact in methiothepin-treated broilers. Methiothepin will be a useful tool for evaluating the role of 5-HT in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension syndrome (ascites) as well as the onset of pulmonary hypertension triggered by inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial lipolysaccharide.",,England,2006,10.1093/ps/85.4.777,"Clinical Trial and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16615363

Although the long term effects of MDMA on serotonin (5-HT) terminals have been well studied, other potential neurochemical consequences associated with MDMA-induced 5-HT depletion have been less well investigated. In view of the cognitive impairments in human MDMA abusers and the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in learning and memory, it was of interest to determine the influence of a 5-HT depleting regimen of MDMA on subsequent stimulation of ACh release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Male rats received vehicle or MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p. every 2 h for four injections) and underwent in vivo microdialysis 7 days later to assess the subsequent drug- (e.g., MDMA, 5-HT1A agonist) or stress- (e.g., tail pinch, presence of an intruder rat) induced stimulation of ACh release. The increase in the extracellular concentration of ACh in the PFC produced by MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was significantly less in rats previously exposed to the neurotoxic regimen of MDMA than that in control animals. In contrast, there was no difference in the magnitude of the stimulation of cortical ACh release elicited by the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.3mg/kg, s.c.), tail pinch (30 min) or the presence of an intruder rat (40 min) between control animals and animals previously exposed to a neurotoxic regimen of MDMA.

The mechanisms underlying the effectiveness and adverse effects of these drugs are, to date, not sufficiently explained. This article summarises the hypothetical mechanisms of action of atypical antipsychotics with respect to the neurobiology of schizophrenia.When considering treatment models for schizophrenia, the role of dopamine receptor blockade and modulation remains dominant. The optimal occupancy of dopamine D(2) receptors seems to be crucial to balancing efficacy and adverse effects - transient D(2) receptor antagonism (such as that attained with, for example, quetiapine and clozapine) is sufficient to obtain an antipsychotic effect, while permanent D(2) receptor antagonism (as is caused by conventional antipsychotics) increases the risk of adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms. Partial D(2) receptor agonism (induced by aripiprazole) offers the possibility of maintaining optimal blockade and function of D(2) receptors. Balancing presynaptic and postsynaptic D(2) receptor antagonism (e.g. induced by amisulpride) is another mechanism that can, through increased release of endogenous dopamine in the striatum, protect against excessive blockade of D(2) receptors. Serotonergic modulation is associated with a beneficial increase in striatal dopamine release. Effects on the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia relate to dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex; this can be modulated by combined D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism (e.g. by olanzapine and risperidone), partial D(2) receptor antagonism or the preferential blockade of inhibitory dopamine autoreceptors. In the context of the neurodevelopmental disconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics (in contrast to conventional antipsychotics) induce neuronal plasticity and synaptic remodelling, not only in the striatum but also in other brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. This mechanism may normalise glutamatergic dysfunction and structural abnormalities and affect the core pathophysiological substrates for schizophrenia.",,New Zealand,2006,10.2165/00023210-200620050-00004,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16696579

The present study compared the effects of pretreatment with the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP and the mGluR1a antagonist CPCCPOEt upon behavioral and neurochemical variables associated with EtOH reward in alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J mice. Pretreatment with either antagonist (0-10 mg/kg, IP) dose-dependently reduced measures of EtOH reward in an operant self-administration paradigm and the maximally effective antagonist dose (10 mg/kg) also blocked the expression of EtOH-induced place conditioning, as well as EtOH consumption under 24-h free-access conditions. MPEP pretreatment did not significantly alter the EtOH dose-locomotor response function; however, it prevented EtOH-induced changes in extracellular dopamine, glutamate and GABA in the nucleus accumbens (NAC). In contrast, CPCCOEt shifted the EtOH dose-response function downwards, enhanced the capacity of higher EtOH doses to elevate NAC levels of GABA and lowered extracellular dopamine and glutamate below baseline following EtOH injection. It is suggested that the ""anti-alcohol"" effects of MPEP may involve an attenuation of the neurochemical signals mediating EtOH reward, whereas those of CPCCOEt may involve an increased sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of EtOH upon brain and behavior.",,Ireland,2006,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2006.04.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16697125

Functional disturbances in either of these neurotransmitter systems are well-established correlates of the psychopathological symptoms and behavioral manifestations observed in addiction and schizophrenia. Increasing evidence from the anatomical, pharmacological and behavioral neuroscience fields points to complex functional interactions between these receptor systems at the anatomical, pharmacological and neural systems levels. An important question relates to whether these systems act in an orchestrated manner to produce the emotional processing and sensory perception deficits underlying addiction and schizophrenia.

Its in vivo kinetics were monitored in rat striatum and cerebellum using a beta-sensitive Microprobe system. Control studies showed that [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding was reversible and reached a peak time equilibrium of specific binding in striatum 30 min after radiotracer injection. The binding potential (BP) calculated by the simplified reference tissue model was 3-fold higher than that measured with [11C]-(-)-NPA (2.14 +/- 0.50 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.01, respectively). In contrast, the methyl analog of (+)-PHNO, [11C]-(+)-MHNO, which displayed promising D2-agonist properties in vitro, showed no specific binding in the striatum in vivo. [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding was totally blocked by raclopride (1 mg/kg; i.v.) and 97% displaced by NPA (2 mg/kg; i.v.) suggesting that [11C]-(+)-PHNO was specific for the high affinity states of D2/D3-receptors. However, (+)-PHNO (1 mg/kg; i.v.) totally blocked and displaced [11C]-raclopride binding in striatum. Thus, (+)-PHNO at high concentrations might be able to bind to the low affinity states of D2/D3-receptors. After an amphetamine pretreatment (2 mg/kg; i.v.), a 69% decrease in BP value (P < 0.05) was observed for [11C]-(+)-PHNO indicating that its binding was highly sensitive to variations of endogenous DA.

The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to evaluate the reinforcing effects of l-cathinone in four differently treated groups of rats. Half of the animals were trained to discriminate the interoceptive cues produced by 0.8 mg/kg cathinone in a two-lever, food-motivated operant task. The other animals were equally divided between two groups, one receiving saline and noncontingent reinforcements on the same schedule as those trained to discriminate cathinone; the other group, the ""yoked-control"" rats, received the same cathinone and saline regimen of administration as the discrimination-trained animals. Results of CPP testing indicate that cathinone produced a statistically significant conditioned place preference only in the group trained to discriminate cathinone and not in the saline or yoked control groups. Furthermore, when half of the cathinone discrimination-trained rats were pretreated with the dopamine release inhibitor CGS 10746B, the conditioned place preference to cathinone was attenuated. The results would indicate that pairing cathinone with a nonpreferred environment tended to make the rat spend more time in that environment and the amount of time spent in the cathinone-associated environment can be increased by prior discrimination training and decreased by diminished dopamine function in the brain.",,United States,1991,10.1016/0091-3057(91)90582-m,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1673251
55878160-29b9-45d2-a1c5-8ace62bd25b8,Role of serotonin in therapy of depression and related disorders.,Fuller RW ,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,,"Several developments in serotonin neuropharmacology have implications for psychiatric disorders and have already begun to impact their treatment. Selective inhibitors of serotonin uptake, which enhance serotonergic function by preventing the removal of serotonin from the synaptic cleft via the membrane transporter, have been introduced for the treatment of depression and may be effective in other disorders. Precursor loading can increase serotonin concentrations in the synaptic cleft, and tryptophan--which has been available in health food stores and drug stores--had become increasingly used for self-medication of depression, insomnia, and premenstrual syndrome. Conversion to serotonin is not the major metabolic pathway for tryptophan, and large increases in other tryptophan metabolites (such as quinolinic acid, a substance that is excitotoxic at high concentrations) accompany small increases in extracellular serotonin. The recent epidemic of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with tryptophan now appears due to a trace contaminant in the product from a single manufacturer. A major advance in serotonin pharmacology has been the elucidation of serotonin receptor heterogeneity. At least seven receptor subtypes (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4) have been identified in brain. Direct-acting agonists and antagonists can have selective affinity for specific receptor subtypes. Selective activation of 5-HT1A receptors seems to cause anxiolytic and possibly antidepressive effects. Selective antagonists of 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 receptors may be useful in treating anxiety and schizophrenia. Drugs that enhance serotonergic function suppress aggression in animals, but the specific receptor subtypes involved are not known. The advances being made in serotonin pharmacology will help define the role of this brain neurotransmitter in psychiatric and other disorders and can be expected to lead to further therapeutic advances.",,United States,1991,,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1674251

In contrast, autoreceptor supersensitivity was not found with the nonselective auto- and postsynaptic receptor agonist R(-)-NPA. Presumably, this effect represents some modification of a presynaptic regulatory mechanism controlling DA synthesis which can occur despite a reportedly high striatal DA autoreceptor reserve in rat striatum [2, 7]. Such a mechanism, by tending to reduce synaptic availability of DA, may contribute to tolerance to the transient, early DA-synthesis stimulating actions of acutely administered neuroleptics [4], and help to counterbalance increases in postsynaptic DA receptor abundance and sensitivity associated with long-term neuroleptic treatment.",,England,1991,10.1016/0006-2952(91)90148-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1674873

However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of the stimulant drug methylphenidate. The present study examined the putative role of dopaminergic transmission in i.v. methylphenidate reward as measured by conditioned place preference. Rats were shown to exhibit conditioned place preference for i.v. methylphenidate (5 mg/kg, not 2 mg/kg). Administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (0.1-0.8 mg/kg i.p.), either during conditioning or on test day, dose-dependently attenuated the magnitude of the conditioned place preference. Finally, we examined the effects of bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of nucleus accumbens core, medial shell or anteromedial olfactory tubercle on the rewarding and locomotor stimulant effects of methylphenidate. Residual dopamine innervation, as assessed by radioligand binding to the dopamine transporter, revealed a significant association between core dopamine innervation and the locomotor stimulant effect of methylphenidate. However, neither core nor medial shell dopamine innervation was related to conditioned place preference magnitude. Instead, conditioned place preference magnitude was associated with dopamine innervation in the anteromedial olfactory tubercle. These results establish a role for dopaminergic transmission in both i.v. methylphenidate conditioned place preference and locomotor stimulation. As well, they suggest that different ventral striatal subregions mediate the rewarding (anteromedial olfactory tubercle) and locomotor stimulant (accumbens core) effects of methylphenidate.",,United States,2006,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2006.04.040,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16753267

The data, while conflicting, point to the involvement of many neuroregulators at numerous integrative levels of the process. However the long term question still remain: what triggers and maintain sleep, what stops sleep, what occurs to the body and brain during sleep--in essence, why sleep? These questions are now problems for behavioral neurochemists, whereas in a previous era, they were problems for philosophers. Unfortunately, our answers to date, while in another idiom, have hardly been more complete or satisfying. To answer these questions, it will be necessary to understand, in detail, the manner in which neurobiochemical processes relate to the functional physiology of sleep. Although existing studies have given invaluable insight into the neurochemical anatomy of sleep, we have only recently acquired the technical and biochemical expertise necessary to investigate sleep as it occurs normally. Future research must focus on the dynamic changes associated with the regulatory mechanisms of neurotransmitters. Many questions can be asked. With sleep transitions, what changes occur in transmitter content, synthesis, or release? Are there changes in metabolic pathways, reflecting a shift from intra- to interneuronal metabolism? What changes occur in pre- and postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors to affect sensitivity? What constraints do genetic (245) and environmental (246) factors impose upon these mechanisms? Knowledge of such parameters will allow us to construct more complete models of the neuroregulatory basis of sleep and waking. However, as we acquire this knowledge, we must avoid the temptation of assuming causation when the evidence merely shows correlation. Neuroregulation are involved in the control of number different behaviors; and, at present, we have few, if any, methods of establishing causative links between a specific neuroregulator and a specific behavioral state. Yet, even without an understanding of what ""causes"" sleep, we may be able to develop pharmacological agents which permits discrete alteration of sleep mechanisms in a more physiological and specific manner. This potential for manipulation of sleep is of obvious importance in illnesses such as insomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea (247, 248). In addition, it may be valuable in the treatment of such conditions as psychosis and depression, where sleep disturbances are an important component of the illness. For example, delirium tremens might be best understood as a psychotic episode which is the result of an aspect of sleep emerging into wakefulness. The range and breadth of both the basic questions and the potential application of sleep research portend an exciting future for this field.",,United States,1975,10.1146/annurev.me.26.020175.002435,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-167654

However, several new findings suggest that abnormal, although not necessarily excessive, dopamine activity is an important factor in schizophrenia. The authors discuss these findings and their implications. METHOD: All published studies regarding dopamine and schizophrenia and all studies on the role of dopamine in cognition were reviewed. Attention has focused on post-mortem studies, positron emission tomography, neuroleptic drug actions, plasma levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA), and cerebral blood flow. RESULTS: Evidence, particularly from intracellular recording studies in animals and plasma HVA measurements, suggests that neuroleptics act by reducing dopamine activity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Post-mortem studies have shown high dopamine and HVA concentrations in various subcortical brain regions and greater than normal dopamine receptor densities in the brains of schizophrenic patients. On the other hand, the negative/deficit symptom complex of schizophrenia may be associated with low dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex. Recent animal and human studies suggest that prefrontal dopamine neurons inhibit subcortical dopamine activity. The authors hypothesize that schizophrenia is characterized by abnormally low prefrontal dopamine activity (causing deficit symptoms) leading to excessive dopamine activity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons (causing positive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: The possible co-occurrence of high and low dopamine activity in schizophrenia has implications for the conceptualization of dopamine's role in schizophrenia.

Our data showed that the conditioning treatments with intra-medial septum injection of different doses of histamine (0.5-15 microg/rat) induced a significant CPP for the drug-associated place. Using a 3-day schedule of conditioning, it was found that the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, pyrilamine (10 and 15 microg/rat, intra-medial septum) also induced a significant place preference. In addition, pyrilamine inhibited the histamine (7.5 microg/rat)-induced place preference. Intra-medial septum administration of the histamine H2 receptor antagonist, ranitidine (5-15 microg/rat) alone or in combination with histamine did not produce a significant place preference or place aversion. On the other hand, intra-medial septum administration of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 233390 (0.5, 0.75 and 1 microg/rat) inhibited the histamine (7.5 microg/rat) or pyrilamine (15 microg/rat)-induced place preference in a dose-dependent manner, but no effect was observed for the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride on the histamine or pyrilamine response. The administration of histamine (2.5-15 microg/rat) or pyrilamine (10 and 15 microg/rat) during acquisition increased locomotor activity of the animals on the testing days. The results suggest that histaminergic receptors of the medial septum may be involved in CPP and thus it is postulated that dopamine D1 receptors may play an important role in this effect.",,Netherlands,2006,10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.024,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16828718

Down-regulation of beta-receptor-linked adenylate cyclase is a well-documented adaptive response to chronic administration of antidepressant drugs. In this study, we investigated dopamine receptor and beta-adrenoceptor changes induced by chronic administration of low doses of l-sulpiride. The data indicate that striatal D1 and D2 receptor function was desensitized by the treatment, which suggests that at low doses l-sulpiride preferentially blocks D2 autoreceptors, leading to increased dopamine release. l-Sulpiride also induced a selective down-regulation of beta-receptor-associated adenylate cyclase activity in the frontal cortex, but not in the striatum, which does not receive norepinephrine projections. Taken together these data suggest that cortical noradrenergic terminals may be endowed with dopamine D2 receptors controlling norepinephrine release and that blockade of this dopaminergic inhibitory modulation may be involved in the antidepressant effects of l-sulpiride.",,Netherlands,1991,10.1016/0014-2999(91)90465-3,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1683290

Evidence suggests that soman-induced convulsions may be associated with postexposure brain neuropathology. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pharmacologic mechanism of action of soman-induced convulsions and of anticonvulsant drugs. Various classes of compounds were evaluated for their efficacy in preventing soman-induced convulsions in rats pretreated with the oxime HI-6 to increase survival time, along with various doses of the test compounds (IM) either in the absence or presence of atropine sulfate (16 mg/kg, IM) 30 minutes prior to a soman challenge dose (180 micrograms/kg, SC; equivalent to 1.6 x LD50) that produced 100% convulsions. Without atropine sulfate, only tertiary anticholinergics (scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, biperiden, benactyzine, benztropine, azaprophen and aprophen), caramiphen, carbetapentane and MK-801 were effective anticonvulsants. In the presence of atropine sulfate, the benzodiazepines (diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, loprazolam and alprazolam), mecamylamine, flunarizine, diphenylhydantoin, clonidine, CGS 19755 and Organon 6370 studied were effective. We have examined the possibility that diazepam may exert some of its anticonvulsant effects through cholinergic mechanisms and found that a reduced release of ACh into synapses after diazepam and atropine treatment may account for diazepam's anticonvulsant activity against soman. We also found that at anticonvulsant doses biperiden and trihexyphenidyl each significantly reversed the effects of soman on striatal levels of DOPAC and HVA, the metabolites of dopamine, and have concluded that in addition to actions on muscarinic receptors, the anticonvulsant effects of these anticholinergics in soman poisoning may be partially related to their actions on the striatal dopaminergic system. These findings allow us to postulate that central muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms are primarily involved in eliciting the convulsions following exposure to soman and that subsequent recruitment of other excitatory neurotransmitter systems and loss of inhibitory control may be responsible for sustaining the convulsions and for producing the subsequent brain damage. Future studies to confirm these neuropharmacological mechanisms are proposed.",,United States,1991,10.1016/s0149-7634(05)80028-4,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1683477

We examined the effects of fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on mechanical allodynia and its mechanism of action in the mouse chronic pain model, which was prepared by partially ligating the sciatic nerve. The antiallodynic effect was measured using the von Frey test. Fluvoxamine produced antiallodynic effects following both systemic and intrathecal administration. In 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-depleted mice, prepared by intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihyroxytryptamine, the fluvoxamine-induced antiallodynic effect was significantly attenuated. The antiallodynic effects of systemic fluvoxamine were also reduced by both systemic and intrathecal administration of ketanserin, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist. In addition, fluvoxamine also induced antinociceptive effect in the acute paw pressure test, and this effect was antagonized by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron.

Thus, targeting mGluR2/3s might be a novel treatment for several psychiatric disorders associated with inappropriate glutamatergic neurotransmission, such as schizophrenia. In an effort to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of LY379268, a potent and selective mGluR2/3 agonist, we examined its effect on ketamine-evoked hyperlocomotion and sensorimotor gating deficit (PPI) in rats, an animal model of schizophrenia. We also measured the ex vivo tissue level of glutamate (Glu), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) as well as the DA metabolites DOPAC and the major 5-HT metabolite HIAA to determine the neurochemical effects of ketamine (12 mg/kg) and LY379268 (1 mg/kg) in the dentate gyrus (DG). While LY379268 (1-3 mg/kg) reduced ketamine-evoked hyperlocomotion (12 mg/kg), it could not restore ketamine-evoked PPI deficits (4-12 mg/kg). In the DG we found that ketamine decreased Glu and DA levels, as well as HIAA/5-HT turnover, and that LY379268 could prevent ketamine effects on Glu level but not on monoamine transmission. These results may indicate that the inability of LY379268 to reverse PPI deficits is attributable to its lack of effect on ketamine-induced changes in monoamine transmission, but that LY379268 can prevent ketamine-evoked changes in glutamate, which is sufficient to block hyperlocomotion. In addition to the partial effectiveness of LY379268 in the ketamine model of schizophrenia, we observed a dual effect of LY379268 on anxious states, whereby a low dose of this compound (1 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic effects, while a higher dose (3 mg/kg) appeared to be anxiogenic.

Accumulated evidence during the last two decades has implicated disturbances in brain serotonin and/or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) neurotransmission in the aetiology of depression. In fact, current pharmacological treatment for mood disorders is based on the use of drugs that act mainly by enhancing brain serotonin and noradrenaline neurotransmission by blockade of the active reuptake mechanism for these neurotransmitters. However, current antidepressant drugs have a delayed onset of therapeutic action, and a substantial number of patients do not respond adequately to them. In addition, these drugs have a number of adverse effects that limit patient compliance. In view of this, there is an intense search to identify novel (receptor) targets for antidepressant therapy. Recent studies have indicated that several neuropeptides and their receptors are potential candidates for the development of novel antidepressant treatment. In this context, galanin is of particular interest, since it is co-localised with serotonin in the dorsal raphe nucleus and with noradrenaline in the locus coeruleus, nuclei known to play a major role in affective disorders and in the action of antidepressant drugs. The actions of galanin are mediated by three receptor subtypes (GAL1, GAL2 and GAL3), which are coupled to different intracellular effector systems. Studies in rats have shown that galanin administered intracerebroventricularly is a potent inhibitor of mesencephalic serotonergic neurotransmission, as indicated by a long-lasting reduction in the release of serotonin in the hippocampus. This inhibitory effect is related to activation of the galanin receptors located on the dorsal raphe neurons. Moreover, intracerebroventricular galanin alters the gene expression of serotonin 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe and also changes their functional activity. In addition, galanin produces a functional blockade of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses. Both pharmacological and genetic studies suggest a role for galanin in depression-like behaviour in rodent models. Transgenic mice overexpressing galanin under the control of the platelet-derived growth factor-beta promoter display increased immobility in the forced swim test. Intracerebroventricular administration of galanin in the rat increases depression-like behaviour, and this is fully blocked by the nonselective peptide galanin receptor antagonist M35. Importantly, M35 alone administered intracerebroventricularly produces an antidepressant-like effect. Recently, newly developed receptor-specific nonpeptidergic galanin GAL3 receptor antagonists (SNAP-37889 and SNAP-398299), which cross the blood-brain barrier after systemic administration, have shown antidepressant-like activity in several animal models. On the other hand, stimulation of the GAL2 receptor at the raphe level by local application of the GAL2 receptor agonist galanin (2-11) has been shown to increase serotonin levels in the hippocampus and dorsal raphe. These results indicate an important (mainly inhibitory) role of galanin as a regulator of brain serotonin and 5-HT1A receptor-mediated transmission, which may be of potential importance for understanding mood disorders and for the development of antidepressant drugs. Taken together, the present evidence suggests that antidepressant efficacy may be associated with compounds acting as antagonists at the GAL3 and/or possibly GAL1 receptors, and/or agonists at the GAL2 receptor.",,New Zealand,2006,10.2165/00023210-200620080-00003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16863269

Then, it becomes necessary to study the consequences of caffeine plus MDMA combination. MDMA (1 mg/kg) elicited an analgesic response both at the spinal and supraspinal levels. However, when associated, MDMA and caffeine did not show any synergistic interaction. When caffeine was administered prior to MDMA, a potentiation of locomotor activity was observed, which consisted in an increase in maximal values and in a prolonged time of activity. In the neurotoxicity studies, a hyperthermic effect of MDMA was observed. Although caffeine alone failed to alter body temperature, it potentiated MDMA-induced hyperthermia. This association also significantly increased MDMA lethality (from 22% to 34%). Following administration of MDMA to rats, there was a persistent decrease in the number of serotonin transporter sites in the cortex, striatum and hippocampus, which was potentiated by caffeine co-treatment. This MDMA toxicity in rats was accompanied by a transient dopaminergic impairment in the striatum, measured as decreased [(3)H]WIN35428 binding sites, by 31% 3 days after treatment, which was not modified by caffeine. A transient down-regulation of 5-HT(2) receptors occurred in the cortex of MDMA-treated rats, whose recovery was slowed by co-treatment with caffeine. In conclusion, the association of MDMA with caffeine does not generate any beneficial effects at the antinociceptive level. The acute effects stemming from this association, in tandem with the final potentiation of serotonergic terminals injury, provide evidence of the potentially greater long-term adverse effects of this particular recreational drug combination.",,Netherlands,2006,10.1016/j.brainres.2006.06.087,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16889759

Therefore, we investigated the effects of 40 min of profound hypoglycemia (isoelectric EEG) and 1-2 h of normoglycemic recovery on the concentrations of QUIN in brain tissue, brain extracellular fluid, and plasma in male Wistar rats. Plasma QUIN increased 6.5-fold by the time of isoelectricity (2 h after insulin administration). Regional brain QUIN concentrations increased two- to threefold during hypoglycemia and increased a further two- to threefold during recovery. However, no change in extracellular fluid QUIN concentrations in hippocampus occurred during hypoglycemia or recovery as measured using in vivo microdialysis. Therefore, the increases in brain tissue QUIN concentrations may reflect elevations of QUIN in the intracellular space or be secondary to the increases in QUIN in the vascular compartment in brain per se. L-Tryptophan concentrations increased more than twofold during recovery only.

The metabolite 1PP, which displays alpha 2 adrenoceptor blocking properties, either had no effect or raised extracellular 5HIAA, depending on the dose (1.5 or 6 mg/kg).

Here we have explored the ability of endogenous dopamine, present in slices containing the prefrontal cortex, to influence excitatory synaptic transmission. We found that 10 microM amphetamine, which releases and blocks the reuptake of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals, significantly depressed excitatory field potentials recorded in layer V during stimulation of layer II/III. The depression was reversible, dose dependent and correlated with increased paired pulse facilitation, suggesting that amphetamine inhibits the presynaptic release of glutamate. Pharmacological dissection of this response showed that dopamine D1 receptors are likely to mediate the effects of endogenous dopamine on excitatory synaptic transmission, with little effect of alpha2 adrenergic receptors, serotonin receptors, or D2 dopamine receptors. The time to peak amphetamine effect was longer than expected based on diffusion, suggesting that to raise dopamine levels in brain slices amphetamine may need to be transported into the presynaptic terminals.

Serotonergic agonists acting on these upregulated receptors are potential therapeutic agents that could ameliorate motor deficits. However, modification of 5-HT receptors following complete spinal cord injury results in different effects by 5-HT2C receptor agonists and antagonists. For example, administration of 5-HT2C receptor agonists suppresses locomotor activity in normal animals, but enhances it in spinalized animals. In addition, administration of 5-HT2C receptor agonists does not induce activity-dependent hindlimb tremors in normal animals, but does induce them in spinalized animals. We therefore extended our previous work with the 5-HT2C receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-piperazine hydrochloride (mCPP), which enhances weight-supported stepping when administered to adult rats spinalized as neonates, to identify the optimal dose for improved weight-supported stepping with minimal side effects. In order to determine whether mCPP enhances weight-supported stepping after SCI is through activation of the 5-HT2C receptor, we performed the following experiments. We determined that stimulation of the 5-HT1A receptor did not contribute to this improvement in weight-support.

The APD are differentiated into typical and atypical based on the lower incidence of extra-pyramidal side-effects associated with the newer atypical APD. It was suggested that atypicality may arise from an interaction with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2) receptor and specifically on the 5-HT(2):dopamine D(2) affinity ratio. It is now realised that multiple subtypes of these receptors exist and that in addition, atypical APD interact with many monoamine receptors. The aim of the present study was to characterise the interaction of APD with a variety of monoamine receptors in terms of both affinity and efficacy. The data produced has highlighted that the atypical profile of APD such as olanzapine and clozapine may reflect antagonism of the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, whilst that of, ziprasidone and quetiapine may reflect partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor, and that of aripiprazole may reflect partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor as well as is its claimed partial agonist activity at the dopamine D(2) receptor.",,United Arab Emirates,2006,10.2174/187152706777950693,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16918396

The exact molecular mechanism by which R-citalopram inhibits the effect of S-citalopram on the serotonin transporter remains to be elucidated.

Escitalopram can be considered as an allosteric serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This serotonin dual action in binding to two sites on the serotonin transporter (both the primary site and the allosteric site) is hypothesised to be responsible for a longer binding to, and therefore greater inhibition of the serotonin transporter by escitalopram.",,England,2006,10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.pto_295.x,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16918708

However, whether deficits in genes encoding G protein-coupled receptors may down-regulate the activity of 5-HT neurons is unknown currently. Based on recent evidence that stress-induced anorexia may involve 5-HT(4)receptors (5-HT(4)R), we measured various aspects of 5-HT function in 5-HT(4)R knock-out (KO) mice. When compared to dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons from wild-type mice, those from 5-HT(4)R KO mice exhibited reduced spontaneous electrical activity. This reduced activity was associated with diminished tissue levels of 5-HT and its main metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Cumulative, systemic doses of the 5-HT uptake blocker citalopram, that reduced 5-HT cell firing by 30% in wild-type animals, completely inhibited 5-HT neuron firing in the KO mice. This effect was reversed by administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R) antagonist, WAY100635, in mice of both genotypes. Other changes in DRN of the KO mice included increases in the levels of 5-HT plasma membrane transporter sites and mRNA, as well as a decrease in the density of 5-HT(1A)R sites without any change in 5-HT(1A) mRNA content. With the exception of increased 5-HT turnover index in the hypothalamus and nucleus accumbens and a decreased density of 5-HT(1A)R sites in the dorsal hippocampus (CA1) and septum, no major changes were detected in 5-HT territories of projection, suggesting region-specific adaptive changes.

Based on the purported implication of this receptor in cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, the present study assessed efficacy of SSR180711 (i.p. and p.o.) in different types of learning and memory involved in this pathology. SSR180711 enhanced episodic memory in the object recognition task in rats and mice (MED: 0.3 mg/kg), an effect mediated by the alpha7 n-AChR, as it was no longer seen in mice lacking this receptor. Efficacy was retained after repeated treatment (eight administrations over 5 days, 1 mg/kg), indicating lack of tachyphylaxia. SSR180711 also reversed (MED: 0.3 mg/kg) MK-801-induced deficits in retention of episodic memory in rats (object recognition). The drug reversed (MED: 0.3 mg/kg) selective attention impaired by neonatal phencyclidine (PCP) treatment and restored MK-801- or PCP-induced memory deficits in the Morris or linear maze (MED: 1-3 mg/kg). In neurochemical and electrophysiological correlates of antipsychotic drug action, SSR180711 increased extracellular levels of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (MED: 1 mg/kg) and enhanced (3 mg/kg) spontaneous firing of retrosplenial cortex neurons in rats. Selectivity of SSR180711 was confirmed as these effects were abolished by methyllycaconitine (3 mg/kg, i.p. and 1 mg/kg, i.v., respectively), a selective alpha7 n-AChR antagonist.

The effect of sertindole was compared to those obtained with the reference antipsychotic drugs clozapine and haloperidol, new generation antipsychotics represented by risperidone, olanzapine, ziprasidone, quetiapine, and aripiprazole, as well as, with those of preferential D2/3, D4, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, alpha1, and alpha2 receptor ligands. In similarity with the new generation antipsychotics, sertindole preferentially increase DA output in the NACS as compared to the STR whereas the opposite was true for haloperidol. The regional specific effect of the partial D2 receptor agonist aripiprazole was mainly driven by a decrease in striatal rather that by an increase in accumbal DA output.

Here we used dopamine transporter knock-out mice to examine which particular changes in the regulation of these cell signaling mechanisms are associated with distinct behavioral responses to psychostimulants. In normal animals, amphetamine and methylphenidate increase extracellular levels of dopamine, leading to an enhancement of locomotor activity. However, in dopamine transporter knock-out mice that display a hyperactivity phenotype resulting from a persistent hyperdopaminergic state, these drugs antagonize hyperactivity. Under basal conditions, dopamine transporter knock-out mice show enhanced striatal DARPP-32 phosphorylation, activation of ERK, and inactivation of Akt as compared with wild-type littermates. However, administration of amphetamine or methylphenidate to these mice reveals that inhibition of ERK signaling is a common determinant for the ability of these drugs to antagonize hyperactivity. In contrast, psychostimulants activate ERK and induce hyperactivity in normal animals. In hyperactive mice psychostimulant-mediated behavioral inhibition and ERK regulation are also mimicked by the serotonergic drugs fluoxetine and 5-carboxamidotryptamine, thereby revealing the involvement of serotonin-dependent inhibition of striatal ERK signaling. Furthermore, direct inhibition of the ERK signaling cascade in vivo using the MEK inhibitor SL327 recapitulates the actions of psychostimulants in hyperactive mice and prevents the locomotor-enhancing effects of amphetamine in normal animals. These data suggest that the inhibitory action of psychostimulants on dopamine-dependent hyperactivity results from altered regulation of striatal ERK signaling. In addition, these results illustrate how altered homeostatic state of neurotransmission can influence in vivo signaling responses and biological actions of pharmacological agents used to manage psychiatric conditions such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).",,United States,2006,10.1074/jbc.M606062200,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-16954211

Increased activity of the mesolimbic dopamine system is associated with increased motor activity. Thus, we investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects of acute and daily microinjections of apamin into the A10 region of the rat. Apamin increased motor activity in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol. In postmortem analysis, 6.0 pmol of apamin significantly increased the levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the A10 region and of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid in the nucleus accumbens, and 2.0 pmol of apamin significantly increased the level of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. In vivo dialysis in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats revealed that apamin elevated extracellular dopamine metabolites. Rats receiving daily microinjections of apamin into the A10 region did not exhibit an augmentation in motor activity, suggesting that rats did not become sensitized to chronic treatment.

Kir3 channels are instrumental in regulating neuronal firing in the central and peripheral nervous system and pacemaker activity in the heart. By using an epitope-tagged degradation-resistant RGS4 mutant, RGS4(C2V), immunoprecipitation of several hemagglutinin-tagged G(i/o)-coupled and G(q)-coupled receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells readily co-precipitated both Kir3.1/Kir3.2a channels and RGS4(C2V).

To document this interaction further, specific behavioral responses of rats to tryptamine and apomorphine were studied. The sequential injection of these agonists, at time intervals with minimal direct behavioral interference, was used to observe response changes with respect to a single challenge. The antagonists haloperidol, ritanserin and risperidone, with known actions on serotonin-S2 (5-HT2) and dopamine-D2 (D2) receptors were used to evaluate effective antagonism of single and sequential challenges. When tryptamine was preceded by an apomorphine challenge the effective doses of the 5-HT2 antagonists ritanserin and risperidone for 50% inhibition of the seizures increased by a factor of 2.5. The dose-response curve of haloperidol remained virtually unchanged, apparently because of the potent dopamine-D2 antagonism associated with these doses which may block the potentiating effect of apomorphine. When apomorphine was preceded by a tryptamine challenge, the total agitation score of the control animals increased by 59% on the average. Haloperidol was equally effective against the enhanced as against the unenhanced apomorphine response. Ritanserin reduced agitation only by the part corresponding to the tryptamine enhancement. Risperidone's activity against the enhanced agitation started at very low doses and was complete at a dose still about 2.5 times lower than that required against the single apomorphine challenge. Mutual enhancement of tryptamine and apomorphine appears to occur even at a time when the behavioral effects of the first agonist are no longer manifest.

After treatment, rats were individually exposed to pressure, and behavioral scores were made for 5 min every 10 ATA up to 70 ATA by an unbiased observer who was not aware of the treatment given. Analysis of all control rats indicated that only a flat body posture, forepaw treading, and hyperlocomotion were positively correlated with pressure, and these events were used in all subsequent analysis.

Rats treated with 5-HTP and quipazine failed to show a significant increase in scores.

Yet, little is known whether D1 or D2 receptor-mediated signals in the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC) are required to learn a reversal of the predictive significance of cues. OBJECTIVE: Here we examined the effects of a selective D1 or D2 receptor blockade in the AcbC on learning a reversal of previously acquired cue-reward magnitude contingencies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were trained on a reaction time (RT) task demanding conditioned lever release with discriminative visual cues signalling in advance the upcoming reward magnitude (one or five food pellets). After acquisition, RTs were guided by cue-associated reward magnitudes, i.e. RTs of responses were significantly shorter for expected high vs low reward. Thereafter, cue-reward magnitude contingencies were reversed. Reversal learning was tested for 12 daily sessions with intra-AcbC micro-infusions being given on sessions 1-6. Subjects received pre-trial infusions of the selective D1 or D2 receptor antagonists, SCH23390 (0.5, 2 microg per side) or raclopride (1, 4 microg per side), or vehicle (0.5 microl). RESULTS: Intra-AcbC infusion of SCH23390 (0.5, 2 microg) or raclopride (1, 4 microg) did not inhibit discrimination reversal learning, but the higher dose of each drug increased RTs of instrumental responses.

After blockade of endogenously expressed alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptors with 2-[2-(2-methoxy-1,4-benzodioxanyl)]-imidazoline hydrochloride (2-methoxyidazoxan, RX821002) and alprenolol, respectively, the resulting pharmacology was consistent with that of a unique receptor subtype. beta-Phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), the putative endogenous ligand, gave an EC50 of 106 +/- 5 nM in the assay. For a series of beta-PEA analogs used to explore the pharmacophore, small substituents at ring positions 3 and/or 4 generally resulted in compounds having lower potency than beta-PEA, although several were as potent as beta-PEA. However, small substituents at ring position 2 resulted in a number of compounds having potencies as good as or better than beta-PEA. A number of nonselective antagonists known to share affinity for multiple monoaminergic receptors were evaluated for their ability to inhibit beta-PEA stimulation of the human TAAR1. None had an IC50 <10 microM. For comparison, the rat TAAR1 receptor was expressed in the AV12-664 cell line. A number of agonist compounds had significantly different relative potencies between the rat and human TAAR1, demonstrating a significant species difference between the rat and human TAAR1. The TAAR1 receptor exhibits a pharmacologic profile uniquely different from those of classic monoaminergic receptors, consistent with the structural information that places them in a distinct family of receptors.

Studies show that serotonin (5-HT) acts through several 5-HT receptors in the brain to modulate DA neurons in all 3 major dopaminergic pathways. There are at least fourteen 5-HT receptor subtypes, many of which have been shown to play some role in mediating 5-HT/DA interactions. Several subtypes, including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, act to facilitate DA release, while the 5-HT2C receptor mediates an inhibitory effect of 5-HT on DA release. Most 5-HT receptor subtypes only modulate DA release when 5-HT and/or DA neurons are stimulated, but the 5-HT2C receptor, characterized by high levels of constitutive activity, inhibits tonic as well as evoked DA release. This review summarizes the anatomical evidence for the presence of each 5-HT receptor subtype in dopaminergic regions of the brain and the neuropharmacological evidence demonstrating regulation of each DA pathway. The relevance of 5-HT receptor modulation of DA systems to the development of therapeutics used to treat schizophrenia, depression, and drug abuse is discussed.

Previous studies in crickets, honey bees and fruit-flies have suggested that octopamine (OA, invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline) and dopamine (DA) mediate various kinds of reward and punishment signals in olfactory learning. However, whether the roles of OA and DA in mediating positive and negative reinforcing signals can be generalized to learning of sensory signals other than odors remained unknown. Here we first established a visual learning paradigm in which to associate a visual pattern with water reward or saline punishment for crickets and found that memory after aversive conditioning decayed much faster than that after appetitive conditioning. Then, we pharmacologically studied the roles of OA and DA in appetitive and aversive forms of visual learning. Crickets injected with epinastine or mianserin, OA receptor antagonists, into the hemolymph exhibited a complete impairment of appetitive learning to associate a visual pattern with water reward, but aversive learning with saline punishment was unaffected. By contrast, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine or spiperone, DA receptor antagonists, completely impaired aversive learning without affecting appetitive learning. The results demonstrate that OA and DA participate in reward and punishment conditioning in visual learning. This finding, together with results of previous studies on the roles of OA and DA in olfactory learning, suggests ubiquitous roles of the octopaminergic reward system and dopaminergic punishment system in insect learning.",,France,2006,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05099.x,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17067299

Anxiety levels are associated with low social connectedness and high environmental threats. Studies provide evidence that anxiety disorders may be link to malfunctioning of serotonin neurotransmission. The present study is designed to monitor serotonin-1A (5-HT-1A) receptor responsiveness following subchronic administration of a serotonergic anxiolytic buspirone. Administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg produced comparable syndrome in repeated saline and repeated buspirone injected rats. Cage crossings were significantly lower in repeatedly buspirone injected rats. Decreases in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in saline than buspirone injected rats.

This form of learning has been associated with the neural memory system, including the striatum body. Cerebral serotonin depletion induces better performance, both in tasks with strong egocentric components and in egocentric navigation in the Morris' maze. Based on this, we propose that the striatal serotonergic depletion must facilitate egocentric learning. Fifteen female Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250-350 g and maintained under standard conditions were chronically implanted with infusion cannulas for bilateral application of drugs into the striatum. The animals were evaluated for egocentric navigation using the Morris' maze, under different conditions: saline solution infusion, serotonin depletion by infusion of 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine (25 microg of free base solved in 2.5 microl of ascorbic acid 1% in saline solution), infusion of mixed dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor antagonists (0.5 microl/min during 5 min of mixed spiperone 20 microM and SCH23390 10 microM), or serotonin depletion and dopamine blockade simultaneously. Striatal serotonin depletion facilitated egocentric learning, which was demonstrated as shorter escape latencies and the display of a defined sequence of movements for reaching the platform. The facilitation was not observed under condition of simultaneous dopamine blockade. Striatal serotonin depletion produced a dopamine-dependent facilitation of egocentric learning.

Some smokers report less sedation during acute ethanol intoxication after nicotine administration and the sedative effects from ethanol are mediated by inhibitory GABA(A)-receptors. In a series of in vivo microdialysis experiments we investigated whether subchronic pre-treatment with nicotinic drugs known to enhance ethanol consumption in the rat (nicotine or the peripheral nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium) could modulate the alterations in extracellular dopamine observed in response to administration of ethanol or the sedative GABA(A)-agonist diazepam. In the nucleus accumbens and the dorsal striatum, systemic and/or local ethanol administration resulted in transient increases in extracellular dopamine levels that returned to baseline before the local levels of ethanol started to decline. In hexamethonium pre-treated rats, however, the nucleus accumbens dopamine levels were time-locked to the ethanol levels in the same area after systemic or local ethanol administration. Perfusion of diazepam into the nucleus accumbens produced a significant reduction in nucleus accumbens dopamine in controls. Prior subchronic treatment with nicotine or hexamethonium abolished this effect. The present results suggest that subchronic treatment with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist hexamethonium reduces a GABA(A)-R mediated counteraction of the nucleus accumbens dopamine response to ethanol. Additionally, we demonstrate that modulation of nicotinic receptors may reduce the sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors to benzodiazepines. These phenomena may offer a novel explanation to why nicotine and alcohol are often co-abused.",,Netherlands,2007,10.1016/j.ejphar.2006.10.056,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17141214

Because the mode of action of (-)-OSU6162 is critical in determining whether psychosis is associated with dopamine D2 receptor overactivity or deficit activity, we measured the potency of (-)-OSU6162 on the binding of [3H]domperidone and on the incorporation of [35S]-GTP-gamma-S into human cloned dopamine D2 receptor-containing cells. We found that (-)-OSU6162 had a dissociation constant of 35 nM at the functional high-affinity site of the dopamine D2 receptor, stimulated the incorporation of [35S]-GTP-gamma-S above 100 nM, and inhibited the incorporating action of 1 microM dopamine with an inhibitory dissociation constant, Ki, of 27 nM, all being properties of a dopamine partial agonist.

Recent microarray studies reported decreased mRNA expression of PKCI/HINT1 in the frontal cortex of individuals with schizophrenia, suggesting the possible involvement of this protein in the pathophysiology of the disease. In view of the documented link between dopamine (DA) transmission and schizophrenia, the present study used behavioral and neurochemical approaches to examine the influence of constitutive PKCI/HINT1 deletion upon: (i) basal and amphetamine (AMPH)-evoked locomotor activity; (ii) DA dynamics in the dorsal striatum, and (iii) postsynaptic DA receptor function. PKCI/HINT1(-/-) (KO) mice displayed lower spontaneous locomotion relative to wild-type (WT) controls. Acute AMPH administration significantly increased locomotor activity in WT mice; nonetheless, the effect was enhanced in KO mice. Quantitative microdialysis studies revealed no alteration in basal DA dynamics in the striatum or nucleus accumbens of KO mice. The ability of acute AMPH to increase DA levels was unaltered indicating that function in presynaptic DA neurotransmission in these regions do not underlie the behavioral phenotype of KO mice. In contrast to WT mice, systemic administration of the direct-acting DA receptor agonist apomorphine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased locomotor activity in KO mice suggesting that postsynaptic DA function is altered in these animals. These results demonstrate an important role of PKCI/HINT1 in modulating the behavioral response to AMPH.

Classic antipsychotic drugs elevate neuronal NO synthase (NOS) expression in the rat striatum. Given that NO signaling potently modulates the membrane excitability of striatal projection neurons, it is plausible that up-regulation of NOS activity after DA D2 receptor blockade contributes to the therapeutic efficacy and/or motor side effects associated with antipsychotic drugs. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the impact of DA D(2) receptor activation on striatal NOS activity in vivo. Characterization of the dopaminergic regulation of striatal NO signaling will be relevant for understanding the mechanism(s) of action of antipsychotic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Striatal NO efflux, evoked via electrical stimulation of the substantia nigra (SN) or systemic administration of the DA D(1) receptor agonist SKF 81297, was assessed in anesthetized rats using an NO-selective amperometric microsensor. RESULTS: The facilitatory effect of SN stimulation on striatal NO efflux was attenuated by systemic administration of the DA D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole. Conversely, administration of the DA D(2) receptor antagonist eticlopride augmented evoked NO efflux. NO efflux induced by systemic administration of SKF 81297 was attenuated by quinpirole and restored by co-administration of quinpirole and eticlopride. The facilitatory effect of SKF 81297 on NO efflux was also significantly attenuated after pretreatment with the non-specific NOS inhibitor methylene blue.

Blocking RGS4 function significantly potentiated the 5-HT(1A) regulation of NMDAR current; conversely, overexpression of RGS4 attenuated the 5-HT(1A) effect. In contrast, the D(4) regulation of NMDAR current was not altered by RGS4 manipulation. Moreover, the 5-HT(1A) regulation of NMDA receptors was significantly enhanced in a subset of PFC pyramidal neurons from rats treated with subchronic phencyclidine, an animal model of schizophrenia, which was found to be associated with specifically decreased RGS4 expression in these cells.

However, when monoamine oxidase type A was invalidated in the VMAT2 KO background (VMAT2-MAOA DKO mice), increases in 5-HT levels coincided with a reduction of cell death and a normalization of Bcl-X(L) expression. trkB signaling is not implicated in the anti-apoptotic effects of MAOA inhibition because BDNF mRNA levels were unchanged in VMAT2-MAOA DKO mice and because the massive cell death in the cerebral cortex of trkB KO mice is also reverted by genetic invalidation of the MAOA gene. Finally the broad 5-HT2 receptor agonist (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride prevented the increase in cell death of VMAT2 KO mice. Altogether, these results suggest that high levels of serotonin, acting through 5-HT2 receptors, have neuroprotective action on cortical neurons by controlling Bcl-X(L) mRNA levels and that this action is independent of trkB signaling.",,United States,2007,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4395-06.2007,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17287506

To characterize the dopaminergic mechanisms involved in this function, we quantified the effects of subtype-specific dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists on acquisition, retention, and reversal of a visual discrimination task in non-human primates (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus). We used a modified Wisconsin General Test Apparatus that was equipped with three food boxes, each fitted with a lid bearing a unique visual cue; one of the cues concealed a food reward, whereas the other two concealed an empty box. The monkeys were trained first to acquire a novel discrimination (eg A(+), B(-), C(-)) in a single session, before experiencing either a reversal of the discrimination (eg A(-), B(+), C(-)) or the acquisition of a completely new discrimination (eg D(+), E(-), F(-)), on the following day. Systemic administration of the D(2)/D(3) receptor antagonist raclopride (0.001-0.03 mg/kg) failed to significantly affect the performance of reversal learning when reversal sessions were run without a retention session. But, raclopride (0.03 mg/kg) significantly impaired performance under the reversal condition when reversal sessions were run right after a retention session; however, it did not affect acquisition of a novel visual discrimination. Specifically, raclopride significantly increased the number of reversal errors made before reaching the performance criterion in the reversal, but not in new learning sessions. In contrast, the D(1)/D(5) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 did not significantly modulate acquisition of a novel discrimination or reversal learning at doses (0.001-0.03 mg/kg, i.m.) that did not suppress behavior generally. In addition, none of the drug treatments affected retention of a previously learned discrimination. The results strongly suggest that D(2)/D(3) receptors, but not D(1)/D(5) receptors, selectively mediate reversal learning, without affecting the capacity to learn a new stimulus-reward association. These data support the hypothesis that phasic DA release, acting through D(2)-like receptors, mediates behavioral flexibility.",,England,2007,10.1038/sj.npp.1301337,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17299511

Here we examined potential disturbances in energy metabolism and interactions between neurons and glia in 15-week-old STOP KO, wild-type, and heterozygous mice. Animals received [1-(13)C]glucose and [1,2-(13)C]acetate, the preferential substrates of neurons and astrocytes, respectively. Extracts from the whole forebrain and midbrain were analyzed by HPLC, (13)C and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Amounts and labeling of most metabolites were unchanged.

The amount of [4-(13)C]glutamate was decreased in STOP KO and heterozygous compared with wild-type mice. gamma-Aminobutyric acid labeling was not influenced by the genotype. Because STOP-deficient mice have a lower synaptic vesicle density, less glutamate is released to the synaptic cleft, leading to decreased stimulation of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors, reflecting increased glutamine metabolism only in the vicinity of the postsynapse of STOP KO mice.",,United States,2007,10.1002/jnr.21200,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17304567

We hypothesized that a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, (2R)-1-[(3-hydroxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-2-[2-(4-methyl-1-piperidinyl)ethyl]-pyrrolidine (SB-269970), should increase activity of 5-HT neurons and potentiate the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram). In rats, administration of 3 mg/kg s.c. citalopram alone increased the extracellular concentration of 5-HT. This effect of citalopram on extracellular 5-HT concentration was significantly enhanced by an ineffective dose of SB-269970. Combining this dose of SB-269970 with a low dose of citalopram also resulted in a significant increase in extracellular concentration of 5-HT, suggesting a potentiation of neurochemical effects. In mice, citalopram and SB-269970 dose-dependently decreased immobility time in the tail suspension test. The dose-effect curve of citalopram was shifted leftward by coadministration of an effective dose of SB-269970. Furthermore, combining ineffective doses of citalopram and SB-269970 also resulted in a significant decrease of immobility time in the tail suspension test, suggesting potentiation of antidepressant-like effects. In rats, SB-269970 potentiated the increase of rapid eye movement (REM) latency and the REM sleep decrease induced by citalopram. SB-269970 also reversed the increase in sleep fragmentation induced by citalopram. Rat plasma and brain concentrations of citalopram were not affected by coadministration of SB-269970, arguing for a pharmacodynamic rather than a pharmacokinetic mechanism. Overall, these results indicate that selective blockade of 5-HT7 receptors may enhance the antidepressant efficacy of citalopram and may provide a novel therapy to alleviate sleep disturbances associated with depression.",,United States,2007,10.1124/jpet.107.119404,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17314195

Thus, the dopamine system has been shown to play a major role in cognitive, affective, and motor functions, and its disruption has been proposed to underlie the pathophysiology of several major psychiatric and neurological disorders, including schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, drug abuse, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although these studies have continued to define the basic functional principles of the dopamine system in the mammalian brain, we are still at the initial stages in unraveling the complex role of this transmitter system in regulating behavioral processes. Accumulating evidence suggests that dopamine modulates excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, and moreover affects synaptic plasticity induced within the circuits of its target brain regions. It is this role in synaptic plasticity that has associated the dopamine system with aspects of cognitive function involving learning and memory. In this chapter, we summarize recent findings relevant to the role of the dopamine system in psychiatric disorders at cellular, anatomical, and functional levels. In particular, we will focus on the regulation of dopamine neuron activity states and how this impacts dopamine release in cortical and subcortical systems, and the physiological and behavioral impact of dopamine receptor stimulation in the postsynaptic targets of these neurons.

Development of the second generation of antipsychotic drugs, otherwise known as atypical antipsychotic drugs, has resulted in treatments with improved subjective tolerability but relatively modest improvements in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia such as avolition, flat affect, and anhedonia. The major current challenge is to develop medications which can further improve negative symptoms treatment and also tackle the intractable clinical problems of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Further advances along these lines with respect to the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurostransmitter systems will be aided by an appreciation of the interaction between dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes in a range of key brain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, and the brain stem nuclei, from which the cell bodies of monoaminergic-containing neurons originate.

This nicotinic cholinergic-mediated inhibitory process represents a potential new target for therapeutic intervention in schizophrenia. This chapter will review evidence implicating the nicotinic cholinergic, and specifically, the alpha7 nicotinic receptor system in the pathology of schizophrenia. Impaired auditory sensory gating has been linked to the alpha7 nicotinic receptor gene on the chromosome 15q14 locus. A majority of persons with schizophrenia are heavy smokers. Although nicotine can acutely reverse diminished auditory sensory gating in people with schizophrenia, this effect is lost on a chronic basis due to receptor desensitization. The alpha7 nicotinic agonist 3-(2,4 dimethoxy)benzylidene-anabaseine (DMXBA) can also enhance auditory sensory gating in animal models.

Interactions between these two drugs have been reported in several pharmacological responses observed in animals, such as body temperature, anxiety, cognition, and reward. However, the interaction between MDMA and cannabis in addictive processes such as physical dependence has not been elucidated yet. DISCUSSION: In this study, the effects of acute and chronic MDMA were evaluated on the behavioral manifestations of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) abstinence in mice. THC withdrawal syndrome was precipitated by injecting the cannabinoid antagonist rimonabant (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice chronically treated with THC and receiving MDMA (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) or saline just before the withdrawal induction or chronically after the THC administration. RESULTS: Both chronic and acute MDMA decreased in a dose-dependent manner the severity of THC withdrawal. In vivo microdialysis experiments showed that acute MDMA (5 mg/kg, i.p.) administration increased extracellular serotonin levels in the prefrontal cortex, but not dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Our results also indicate that the attenuation of THC abstinence symptoms was not due to a direct interaction between rimonabant and MDMA nor to the result of the locomotor stimulating effects of MDMA. CONCLUSION: The modulation of the cannabinoid withdrawal syndrome by acute or chronic MDMA suggests a possible mechanism to explain the associated consumption of these two drugs in humans.",,Germany,2007,10.1007/s00213-007-0772-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17387458

Both octopamine and phenylethylamine decreased high prolactin levels due to swimming or immobilization stress without affecting other adenohypophysial hormones. With regard to the hypoprolactinemic potencies in the immobilization stress model, it was observed that p-tyramine, another trace amine, was as potent as octopamine. Phenylethylamine was the least effective. To evaluate the site of action of the effect described, the three trace amines were tested in dispersed anterior pituitary cell cultures in vitro. Tyramine and octopamine reduced prolactin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations of 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, whereas the hypoprolactinemic effect observed for phenylethylamine was very weak. In pharmacologic experiments, neither octopamine nor phenylethylamine reduced prolactin release when dopaminergic receptors were blocked.

In fluo-4 AM loaded cells, 13-17 days postplating, and after the addition of tetrodotoxin some of the population of mouse embryonic stem cell-derived neurons responded to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), noradrenaline (NA), acetylcholine (ACh) and L-glutamate (L-glut) with elevations of Ca2+ influx. Within the microtubule-associated protein and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell population adenosine triphosphate, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and L-glutamate elicited positive elevations of Ca2+ in 74, 66, 58 and 67% of the population; cells could be further subdivided into three major pharmacologically distinct populations based on the combinations of agonist they responded to. Acetylcholine (30 microM) and noradrenaline (30 microM) were the only agonists to elicit significant tritium overflow from [3H]-dopamine loaded cells. The acetylcholine effect was blocked by atropine (1 microM) and tetrodotoxin (1 microM) and elevated by haloperidol (100 nM). The noradrenaline effects were reduced by cocaine (10 microM), but not by tetrodotoxin (100 nM).

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter controlling synaptic excitability and plasticity in most brain circuits, including limbic pathways involved in depression. Thus, drugs that target glutamate neuronal transmission offer novel approaches to treat depression. Recently, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated clinical efficacy in a randomized clinical trial of depressed patients. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors function to regulate glutamate neuronal transmission by altering the release of neurotransmitter or modulating the post-synaptic responses to glutamate. Accumulating evidence from biochemical and behavioral studies support the idea that the regulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission via mGlu receptors is linked to mood disorders and that these receptors may serve as novel targets for the discovery of small molecule modulators with unique antidepressant properties. For example, mGlu receptor modulation can facilitate neuronal stem cell proliferation (neurogenesis) and the release of neurotransmitters that are associated with treatment response to depression in humans (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine). In particular, compounds that antagonize mGlu2, mGlu3 and/or mGlu5 receptors (e.g. LY341495, MSG0039, MPEP) have been linked to the above pharmacology and have also shown in vivo activity in animal models predictive of antidepressant efficacy such as the forced-swim test. The in vivo actions of these agents can be antagonized by compounds that block AMPA receptors, suggesting that their actions are direct downstream consequences of the enhancement of glutamate neuronal transmission in brain regions involved in depression. These data provide new approaches to finding mechanistically distinct drugs for depression that may have advantages over current therapies for some patients. Moreover, since the mood disorders encompase a non-homogenous set of symptoms, comorbid disorders, and potential etiologies, the rich arsensel that exists within the mGlu receptor families provides an opportunity for both broad and customized therapeutics.",,United Arab Emirates,2007,10.2174/187152707780363302,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17430147

Here, we discuss shared neurobiological substrates in drug withdrawal and depression, with an emphasis on changes in brain reward circuitry that may underlie anhedonia, a core symptom of depression and drug withdrawal. We explored experimentally whether clinical antidepressant medications or other treatments would reverse the anhedonia observed in rats undergoing spontaneous nicotine or amphetamine withdrawal, defined operationally as elevated brain reward thresholds. The co-administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors with a serotonin-1A receptor antagonist, or the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, or the atypical antidepressant bupropion ameliorated nicotine or amphetamine withdrawal in rats. Thus, increases in monoaminergic neurotransmission, or neuroadaptations induced by increased monoaminergic neurotransmission, ameliorated depression-like aspects of drug withdrawal. Further, chronic pretreatment with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, that has some efficacy in the treatment of the depression-like symptoms of schizophrenia, attenuated nicotine and amphetamine withdrawal. Finally, a metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor antagonist reversed threshold elevations associated with nicotine withdrawal. The effects of these pharmacological manipulations are consistent with the altered neurobiology observed in drug withdrawal and depression. Thus, these data support the hypothesis of common substrates mediating the depressive symptoms of drug withdrawal and those seen in psychiatric patients. Accordingly, the anhedonic state associated with drug withdrawal can be used to study the neurobiology of anhedonia, and thus contribute to the identification of novel targets for the treatment of depression-like symptoms seen in various psychiatric and neurological disorders.",,United States,2007,10.1007/BF03033479,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17449445

However, cause and interaction of these neurotransmitter alterations are not understood. In this review, we present a hypothesis integrating current concepts of neurotransmission and hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation with findings on immunological alterations and alterations in brain morphology in MD. An immune activation including increased production of proinflammatory cytokines has repeatedly been described in MD. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-2, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha activate the tryptophan- and serotonin-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Depressive states during inflammatory somatic disorders are also associated with increased proinflammatory cytokines and increased consumption of tryptophan via activation of IDO. An enhanced consumption of serotonin and its precursor tryptophan through IDO activation could well explain the reduced availability of serotonergic neurotransmission in MD. An increased activation of IDO and its subsequent enzyme kynurenine monooxygenase by proinflammatory cytokines, moreover, leads to an enhanced production of quinolinic acid, a strong agonist of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. In inflammatory states of the central nervous system, IDO is mainly activated in microglial cells, which preferentially metabolize tryptophan to the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid, whereas astrocytes - counteracting this metabolism due to the lack of an enzyme of this metabolism - have been observed to be reduced in MD. Therefore the type 1/type 2 immune response imbalance, associated with an astrocyte/microglia imbalance, leads to serotonergic deficiency and glutamatergic overproduction. Astrocytes are further strongly involved in re-uptake and metabolic conversion of glutamate. The reduced number of astrocytes could contribute to both, a diminished counterregulation of IDO activity in microglia and an altered glutamatergic neurotransmission. Further search for antidepressant agents should take into account anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, might exert antidepressant effects by acting on serotonergic deficiency, glutamatergic hyperfunction and antagonizing neurotoxic effects of quinolinic acid.",,England,2007,10.1038/sj.mp.4002006,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17457312

The smoking cessation agent bupropion is an inhibitor of the dopamine transporter, but has also been shown to inhibit nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. To assess the relative impact of its actions at these two targets, we have examined the effects of bupropion on nicotine-evoked [(3)H]dopamine release from rat striatal synaptosomes and slices, in the absence of any other transporter inhibitor. Bupropion (10 microM) significantly decreased nicotine-evoked [(3)H]dopamine release by approximately 50% in both preparations, consistent with the blockade of nicotinic receptors. In support of this interpretation, bupropion also selectively inhibited nicotine-evoked Ca(2+) increases in SH-SY5Y cells. In striatal slices (but not in synaptosomes) the concentration-response profile for bupropion has an inverted 'u' shape, with a decrease in nicotine-evoked [(3)H]dopamine release also observed in the presence of 0.1 microM bupropion. This effect of 0.1 microM bupropion (but not 10 microM bupropion) was reversed by the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist raclopride. We propose that modest blockade of the dopamine transporter by low concentrations of bupropion results in feedback inhibition via dopamine D(2) autoreceptors. This is overcome at higher concentrations of bupropion, before inhibition of nicotinic receptors occurs. Therefore bupropion's inhibition of the dopamine transporter and nicotinic receptors appears to be separated with respect to concentration.",,Netherlands,2007,10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.03.052,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17477919

To test whether erbB signaling contributes to psychiatric disorders by regulating the structure or function of OLs, we analyzed transgenic mice in which erbB signaling is blocked in OLs in vivo.

Benzodiazepine withdrawal results in increased glutamatergic strength, but whether alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (AMPARs) are functionally and structurally remodeled during benzodiazepine withdrawal is uncertain. Whole-cell recordings of rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, either acutely dissociated or in hippocampal slices, revealed that AMPAR function was enhanced up to 50% during flurazepam (FZP) withdrawal, without changes in whole-cell channel kinetic properties. Agonist-elicited AMPA currents showed a negative shift in rectification in the presence of spermine, suggesting augmented membrane incorporation of glutamate receptor (GluR) 2-lacking AMPARs. As GluR1-containing AMPARs are critical for activity-dependent alterations in excitatory strength, we sought to determine whether changes in GluR1 subunit distribution in CA1 neurons occurred during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Confocal image analysis revealed that FZP withdrawal promoted GluR1 subunit incorporation into somatic and proximal dendritic membranes of CA1 neurons without GluR2 subunit alterations. Findings of immunoblot studies were consistent with immunofluorescent studies indicating increased GluR1, but not GluR2, subunit protein levels in cytosolic, crude membrane and postsynaptic density-enriched fractions from CA1 minislices. As with long-term potentiation (LTP), the FZP-withdrawal-induced GluR1 incorporation into CA1 neuron membranes may require the GluR1-trafficking protein, synapse-associated protein 97, which was also elevated in membrane-associated fractions. Together, our findings provide evidence that during FZP withdrawal, increased membrane incorporation of GluR1-containing AMPARs and associated up-regulation of AMPAR functions in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons share fundamental similarities with the mechanisms underlying LTP. This implies that glutamatergic neuronal remodeling observed in LTP also subserves physiological adaptations to drug withdrawal.",,United States,2007,10.1124/jpet.107.121798,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17510319

Activation of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptors enhances NMDA receptor mediated currents in vitro, implying that allosteric modulation of mGlu5 receptors may have therapeutic efficacy for schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to determine if positive allosteric modulators of mGlu5 receptors are effective in reversing two cellular effects of NMDA receptor antagonists that are relevant to schizophrenia: increases in corticolimbic dopamine neurotransmission and disruption of neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). METHODS: In freely moving rats, we measured the effects of the positive modulator of mGlu5 receptor 3-cyano-N-(1,3-diphenyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzamide (CDPPB) alone or in combination with the NMDA antagonist MK801 on 1) spontaneous firing and bursting of medial PFC (mPFC) neurons, and 2) dopamine release as measured by microdialysis in the mPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc). RESULTS: The predominant effect of CDPPB on mPFC neurons was excitatory, leading to an overall excitatory population response. Pretreatment with CDPPB prevented MK801-induced excessive firing and reduced spontaneous bursting. In contrast, CDPPB had no significant effect on basal dopamine release as compared with control rats and did not alter MK801-induced activation of dopamine release in the mPFC and NAc. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that positive modulation of mGlu5 receptors reverses the effects of noncompetitive NMDA antagonists on cortical neuronal firing without affecting dopamine neurotransmission. Thus, these compounds may be effective in ameliorating PFC mediated behavioral abnormalities that results from NMDA receptor hypofunction.",,United States,2007,10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.12.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17511968

Animals develop conditioned place preferences for distinct locations paired with the immediate effects of IV cocaine, but learn to avoid places paired with the effects present 15-min post-injection. It was of interest to assess the putative role of 5-HT in producing the negative properties of cocaine since cocaine acts to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin (5-HT) and since such actions have been associated with anxiogenic consequences. Male rats were administered a reinforcing dose of cocaine (1.0 mg/kg IV) and then placed - either immediately or after a 15-min delay - into one side of a two-compartment (black-white) conditioned place preference (CPP) box for 5-min. On alternate days, the animals received IV saline injections and were placed in the opposite side of the CPP box. This continued for eight days after which animals had experienced 4 pairings of cocaine with one side (black or white) of the CPP apparatus, and 4 saline pairings with the opposite side. Other groups of rats were treated identically except that 30-min prior to placement into the apparatus, these animals received an IP injection of saline or buspirone (a partial 5-HT1A agonist) at a dose that we have shown to be anxiolytic (2.5 mg/kg IP). Control animals experienced either buspirone or saline pretreatments without cocaine. Our results confirm that animals increase the time spent on the side paired with the immediate effects of cocaine (compared to baseline), but tend to avoid the side paired with effects present 15-min post-injection. Buspirone had no effect on the immediate rewarding properties of cocaine, but completely reversed the negative properties present 15-min post-cocaine.

Electrical (3 to 33 Hz) and chemical (glutamate microinjections; 0.5 mol l(-1), 0.3-10 nl) activation of RaphÃ© neurons was performed in brainstem preparations from three developmental stages (pre- and metamorphic tadpoles and adult frogs). Fictive lung ventilation was recorded extracelluarly from the Vth and Xth cranial nerves. Electrical stimulation of RaphÃ© neurons caused a frequency-dependent increase in lung burst frequency in pre-metamorphic tadpoles only. In metamorphic tadpoles, an increase in fictive lung ventilation was observed at 20 Hz only. Electrical stimulation had no effect in preparations from adult frogs. Glutamate microinjections elicited similar responses as a lung burst frequency increase was observed in the pre-metamorphic group only. Regardless of the stimulation technique used, the increase in fictive lung ventilation was attenuated by the selective 5-HT3 antagonist tropisetron (5-20 micromol l(-1)). Results from immunohistochemical analysis of the RaphÃ© region stimulated do not correlate with functional data as the number of 5-HT immunoreactive neurons within this region increases during development.

The aims of this study were to determine the direct effects of 5-HT in hepatocytes and to test the hypothesis that atypical antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 diabetes counter-regulate the effects of 5-HT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat hepatocytes were studied in short-term primary culture. RESULTS: Serotonin (5-HT) stimulated glycogen synthesis at nanomolar concentrations but inhibited it at micromolar concentrations. The stimulatory effect was mimicked by alpha-methyl-5-HT, a mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor agonist, whereas the inhibition was counteracted by a 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist. alpha-Methyl-5-HT stimulated glycogen synthesis additively with insulin, but unlike insulin, did not stimulate glucose phosphorylation and glycolysis, nor did it cause Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation. Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by alpha-methyl-5-HT correlated with depletion of phosphorylase a. This effect could not be explained by elevated levels of glucose 6-phosphate, which causes inactivation of phosphorylase, but was explained, at least in part, by decreased phosphorylase kinase activity in situ. The antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine, which bind to 5-HT receptors, counteracted the effect of alpha-methyl-5-HT on phosphorylase inactivation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence for both stimulation and inhibition of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes by serotonergic mechanisms. The former effects are associated with the inactivation of phosphorylase and are counteracted by atypical antipsychotic drugs that cause hepatic insulin resistance. Antagonism of hepatic serotonergic mechanisms may be a component of the hepatic dysregulation caused by antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 diabetes.",,Germany,2007,10.1007/s00125-007-0696-y,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17579833

These models highlight a pre-psychotic period in which the patient experiences perceptual and attentional disruptions. Irrelevant details and numerous associations between stimuli, thoughts and percepts are imbued with inappropriate significance and the attempt to rationalize and account for these bizarre experiences results in the formation of delusions. The present paper discusses delusion formation in terms of basic associative learning processes. Such processes are driven by prediction error signals. Prediction error refers to mismatches between an organism's expectation in a given environment and what actually happens and it is signalled by both dopaminergic and glutamatergic mechanisms. Disruption of these neurobiological systems may underlie delusion formation. We review similarities between acute psychosis and the psychotic state induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist drug ketamine, which impacts upon both dopaminergic and glutamatergic function.

With this background in mind, the present study was undertaken to monitor the effect of addition of yohimbine (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist) to the effect of fluoxetine (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or venlafaxine (dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine) in Porsolt's forced swim test (FST) using male Laca strain mice. METHOD: The immobility period was recorded in mouse FST during a 6-min period. Different doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine were administered 30 min before exposing the animals to the test procedure. In the combination study, yohimbine (2 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 15 min before the administration of different doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine. RESULTS: Fluoxetine (5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) [F = 28.352] or venlafaxine (2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/kg) [F = 17.842] dose-dependently inhibited the immobility period in mice. Addition of yohimbine (2 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated the antidepressant action of fluoxetine or venlafaxine in mouse FST as the animals showed a decrease in the immobility period compared to the fluoxetine or venlafaxine per se group, respectively.

Mesencephalic KCNQ (also termed K(v)7) potassium channels suppress the basal activity of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. These regions have extensive dopaminergic projections to the striatum and cortex, and positive modulation of KCNQ channel function may therefore potentially reduce the reinforcing impact of central stimulating drugs. We studied the effects of the principal neuronal KCNQ channel opener, retigabine, in rats exposed acutely to cocaine, methylphenidate (dopamine reuptake inhibitors) or phencyclidine (PCP, a psychotomimetic NMDA receptor antagonist). Retigabine (> or =1.0 mg/kg) inhibited cocaine, methylphenidate and PCP-stimulated locomotor activity. Also, retigabine reduced spontaneous locomotor activity. The inhibitory effect of retigabine on psychostimulant-induced locomotor activity was accompanied by a marked reduction in c-Fos expression, in particular the nucleus accumbens and primary motor cortex were responsive to retigabine pre-treatment. Notably, retigabine also reduced basal extracellular levels of striatal dopamine metabolites and partially prevented dopamine overflow in the striatum induced by dopamine reuptake blockade. In combination, these data suggest that retigabine reduces striatal and cortical excitability, thereby attenuating excitatory effects of central stimulating drugs in dopamine-rich areas of the rat forebrain.

Thus, we investigated deprenyl's ability to attenuate methamphetamine-induced dopamine neurotoxicity. We also examined deprenyl's effect in changing markers associated with psychostimulant sensitization. A potential therapeutic effect on either pathological domain would be a boon in developing novel treatments for methamphetamine abuse. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were split into 6 groups. Three groups received a 7-day saline minipump with saline, 0.05 or 0.25 mg/kg SC deprenyl injections given for 10 days before, during and 5 days after the 7-day saline minipump implant. Similarly, 3 groups received methamphetamine pumps (25 mg/kg/day) with escalating daily injections of methamphetamine (0-6 mg/kg) in addition to the minipump treatment. These rats also received saline, 0.05 or 0.25 mg/kg deprenyl injections given before, during and the 7-day minipump treatment. Rats were killed on day 28 of withdrawal and brain samples taken. HPLC analysis for dopamine and 3,4-Dihydroxy-Phenylacetic Acid (DOPAC) revealed a loss of dopamine in the caudate and accumbens which was partially reversed by high dose deprenyl. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining in the midbrain was unaffected by methamphetamine, suggesting that dopamine neurotoxicity was localized to the caudate. Western blot analysis of the caudate after methamphetamine revealed little change in Alpha-Amino-3-Hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-Isoxazole Propionic Acid (AMPA) GluR1 or N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA) NR2B subunits, or their phosphorylation state. However, methamphetamine increased levels of GluR1 and its phosphorylation state in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and these increases were attenuated by deprenyl. Methamphetamine also increased levels of PFC NR2B subunit, but these increases were not attenuated by deprenyl. We suggest that deprenyl may be effective in reducing the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine and may also attenuate changes in prefrontal AMPA receptor function, presumably more associated with addiction rather than neurotoxicity.",,Netherlands,2007,10.1016/j.ejphar.2007.06.046,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17651730

OBJECTIVES: In the current report, we review and integrate many of the major behavioral, physiological, and neurochemical findings in the current literature regarding pharmacological assessments made in SERT mutant mice. RESULTS: The absence of normal responses to serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SRI) antidepressants in SERT knockout (-/-) mice demonstrates that actions on SERT are a critical principle mechanism of action of members of this class of antidepressants. Drugs transported by SERT, (+)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 1-methyl-4-(2'-aminophenyl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (2'-NH(2)-MPTP), are also inactive in SERT -/- mice. Temperature, locomotor, and electrophysiological responses to various serotonin receptor agonists, including 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetraline (8-OH-DPAT), ipsapirone, and RU24969, are reduced in SERT -/- mice, despite comparatively lesser reductions in Htr1a and Htr1b binding sites, G-proteins, and other signaling molecules. SERT -/- mice exhibit an approximately 90% reduction in head twitches in response to the Htr2a/2c agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), associated with a profound reduction in arachidonic acid signaling, yet only modest changes in Htr2a and Htr2c binding sites. SERT -/- mice also exhibit altered behavioral responses to cocaine and ethanol, related to abnormal serotonin, and possibly dopamine and norepinephrine, homeostasis.

dab69e6d-1b36-49ae-bfaa-f044c2bbda0f,Regulation of melatonin synthesis in the ovine pineal gland.,Namboodiri MA and Valivullah HM and Moffett JR ,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,,"The results presented here show clearly that the rapid nocturnal increase in circulating melatonin in sheep is associated with an equally rapid increase in melatonin production in the pineal gland. Pineal NAT activity and NAS concentration also increased under this condition, indicating that NAT activity is an important factor in this process. According to the current model for the regulation of pineal melatonin production in the rat, the large nocturnal increase in NAT activity is the major factor responsible for the daily rhythm in melatonin, as well as for the opposite rhythm in serotonin and its oxidation products in the pineal gland. Increased NAT activity in the pineal gland at night channels serotonin toward melatonin production at an enhanced rate, thereby causing pineal serotonin levels to drop. This, in turn, leads to decreased production of oxidative metabolites due to reduced substrate availability for MAO. Thus, the large increase in NAT activity acts as the key factor, directly or indirectly, for the generation of all rhythms in serotonin metabolites in the pineal gland, and possibly in the circulation. Such an exclusive role for NAT is doubtful in the sheep pineal gland for the following reasons: First, the nocturnal increase in NAT activity is relatively small (3-5-fold) compared to the rat (50-100-fold). Second, in at least two instances--a 30 min light pulse and prazosin treatment--there was a clear dissociation between melatonin production and NAT activity. This lack of correlation between NAT activity and melatonin production does not seem to be due to serotonin availability since serotonin levels did not change under the above conditions. Further, serotonin levels were found to decrease rather than increase when melatonin levels increased at night. Finally, our observation that melatonin production can be increased during the day by increasing serotonin levels in the pineal gland may reflect only the incompletely saturated nature of pineal NAT and may have little relevance for the physiological regulation of pineal melatonin production. Even though NAT activity may not be the only factor responsible for the rhythmic production of serotonin metabolites in sheep pineal gland, activation of the serotonin----melatonin pathway seems to be the primary metabolic response involved in this regulation, since the rhythms in the serotonin metabolites are similar in both rat and sheep. In the rat, the activation of the serotonin----melatonin pathway is brought about exclusively by the increase in NAT activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,United States,1991,10.1007/978-1-4684-5952-4_12,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1772063

The present study assessed the contribution of dopamine and NMDA glutamate receptors in these different forms of decision making using novel effort- and delay-discounting procedures. In the effort-discounting task, rats could either emit a single response on a low-reward lever to receive two pellets, or make 2, 5, 10, or 20 responses on a high-reward (HR) lever to obtain four pellets. In the delay-discounting task, one press of the HR lever delivered four pellets after a delay (0.5-8 s). A third task (effort-discounting with equivalent delays) was similar to the effort-discounting procedure, except that the relative delay to reward delivery was equalized across response options. The dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol reduced choice of the HR lever under all three testing conditions, indicating that dopamine antagonism alters effort-based decision making independent of any contribution of delay. Amphetamine exerted dose-dependent, biphasic effects; a higher dose (0.5 mg/kg) increased effort discounting, whereas a lower dose (0.25 mg/kg) reduced delay discounting. The noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine (5 mg/kg) increased effort and delay discounting, but did not affect choice on the effort with equivalent delays task, indicating a reduced tolerance for delayed rewards. These findings highlight the utility of these procedures in pharmacologically dissociating the neurochemical mechanisms underlying these different, yet interrelated forms of decision making.

Loss of ICC is associated with several motility disorders. The mechanisms modulating ICC survival and proliferation are poorly understood. This study aimed to establish whether 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a role in regulating ICC proliferation. METHODS: Expression of 5-HT receptor mRNA was investigated in muscle strips, in purified populations of ICC, and in identified single cells. The effect of 5-HT(2B) receptor ligands on ICC numbers was studied in primary cell cultures. Proliferation of ICC was determined by counting Ki67-positive cells in culture. RESULTS: Of the 5-HT receptors known to be involved in proliferation, 5-HT(2B) receptor mRNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in jejunal muscle, whereas 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1D), and 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNAs were not. 5-HT(2B) receptor mRNA was found in single ICC and cells purified by flow cytometry. Exogenous 5-HT (1 micromol/L) increased (66% +/- 9%, P < .005) ICC numbers in culture. The 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5-HT(2B) receptor antagonist, SB204741, inhibited the effect of 5-HT. The 5-HT(2B) receptor agonist BW 723C86 induced a concentration-dependent increase in ICC number (50% +/- 6% at 50 nM, P < .04) and increased ICC proliferation (25% +/- 3% vs 19 +/- 1% in controls, P < .03). CONCLUSIONS: These studies establish that 5-HT(2B) receptors are expressed on ICC. Exogenous 5-HT regulates ICC numbers through 5-HT(2B) receptors in part by increasing ICC proliferation.

Bupropion (40 mg/kg) administration on training day only produced deficits in contextual fear conditioning. Alternatively, bupropion (20 or 40 mg/kg) administration during testing dose-dependently produced deficits in contextual and cued fear conditioning.

When this network of venous sinusoids is engorged with blood, the swollen mucosa reduces the size of the airway lumen and congestion ensues. Nasal vasculature tone is strongly influenced by the sympathetic nervous system and the only drugs approved specifically to relieve vascular nasal obstruction are alpha-adrenoceptor sympathomimetic agents. Due to their vasoconstrictor action, the sympathomimetic decongestants oppose vasodilation, reducing nasal airway resistance and thus facilitating nose breathing. However, standard decongestants that are non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonists are associated with the potential for side-effect liabilities including hypertension, stroke, insomnia and nervousness. We propose than a selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, by acting preferentially on nasal venous capacitance vessels, will elicit decongestion with a reduced side-effect liability. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT-920 in a real-time tissue contractility assay using isolated pig nasal explants and in an in vivo cat model of congestion. The vasoconstrictor and decongestant effects of BHT-920 were compared to the non-selective alpha-adrenoceptor agonist epinephrine and the standard decongestant oxymetazoline.

With the publication of the human genome, it has become evident that there still are many ""orphan"" G protein-coupled receptors, i.e., receptors responding to yet-unidentified endogenous ligands.

In this review, we summarise the advancements and pitfalls of the strategies that have been exploited in recent years to ""deorphanise"" some of these receptors. We also show how, in some cases, this deorphanisation process has resulted in the identification of new potential targets for drug development as well as in the discovery of previously unknown neurotransmitters, including bioactive peptides and substances that had been merely known as metabolic intermediates. We envisage that the deorphanisation of the remaining orphan G protein-coupled receptors will further advance our knowledge of nervous system pathophysiology and unveil additional targets for new therapeutic approaches to human diseases, including psychosis, depression, anxiety, pain and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders.",,England,2008,10.1016/j.neuint.2007.08.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17884255
78ec0a42-6ea1-4322-837e-e125ddcdeaa9,From vice to virtue: insights from sensitization in the nonhuman primate.,Castner SA and Williams GV ,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,,"Repeated, intermittent administration of psychomotor stimulants, or D1 agonists in dopamine-deficient states, induces behavioral sensitization, characterized by an enhanced response to a subsequent acute low dose challenge, which may be manifested in form of altered behavior or cognitive function. Amphetamine sensitization in the nonhuman primate encompasses profound and enduring changes to similar neuronal and neurochemical substrates that occur in rodents. The process of sensitization in the monkey also results in a long-lasting depression in baseline behavioral responding, as well as emergence of hallucinatory-like behaviors reminiscent of human psychosis in response to an acute challenge. Nonhuman primates show a reduction in spine density and dendritic length in prefrontal neurons and a marked reduction in basal dopamine turnover in both prefrontal cortex and striatum. A major hallmark of amphetamine sensitization in both nonhuman primates and rodents is the manifestation of deficits in executive function and working memory which rely upon the integrity of prefrontal cortex and thereby, may yield significant insights into the cognitive dysfunction associated with addiction. Together with evidence from human and rodent studies, it can be concluded that repeated exposure to psychomotor stimulants can lead to a corruption of neuroadaptive systems in the brain by an extraordinary influence on synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. Actively harnessing this same process by repeated, intermittent D1 agonist administration may be the key to improved working memory and decision making in addiction and other dopamine dysfunctional states, such as schizophrenia.",,England,2007,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2007.08.026,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17904719

However, experimental and clinical evidence support the notion that cholinergic activity plays a key role in the pathophysiology of manganese-induced neurotoxicity. Manganese acts as a chemical stressor in cholinergic neurons in a region-specific manner causing breakdown of the cellular homeostatic mechanisms. In fact, a number of cholinergic synaptic mechanisms are putative targets for manganese activity: presynaptic choline uptake, quantal release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, postsynaptic binding of acetylcholine to receptors and its synaptic degradation by acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, manganese significantly influences astrocytic choline transport systems and astrocytic acetylcholine-binding proteins. Thus, manganese exerts its effect on the highly dynamic reciprocal relationship between astrocytes and cholinergic neurons. Cholinergic afferents are crucial in the physiology of locomotion, cognition, emotion and behavioral response, and therefore, it is not surprising that the anatomical selectivity of most manganese-induced cholinergic effects is compatible with the clinical correlates of manganism, which involves impairment of emotional response, decline in higher cortical functions and movement disorder. Manganism, also referred to as Parkinson's-like disorder, is initially manifested by a neuropsychiatric syndrome (locura manganica), the most frequent symptoms and signs of which are compulsive behavior, emotional lability, visual hallucinations and flight of ideas, cognitive decline and memory loss. These signs and symptoms are followed by an extrapyramidal syndrome, which shares numerous clinical and pathophysiological characteristics with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). This natural history of disease could be a clinical reflection of the preferential involvement of the cholinergic systems, initially in the septo-hippocampus and later in the basal ganglia. These observations highlight the importance of studying the role of the CNS cholinergic systems in manganese-mediated neurotoxicity.",,Netherlands,2007,10.1016/j.neuro.2007.08.006,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17920128

The purpose of this rodent study was to extend our previous work on this subject by investigating persistent effects (i.e. during a 14 day drug-free washout period) of chronic treatment (i.e. ranging from 45 days to 6 months) with a representative first and second generation antipsychotic. Drug effects on learning and memory and important neurobiological substrates of memory, the neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors, and certain components of the basal forebrain cholinergic system were investigated. Behavioral effects of oral haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg/day), or risperidone (2.5 mg/kg/day) were assessed in an open field, a water maze task, and a radial arm maze procedure and neurochemical effects in brain tissue were subsequently measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The results indicated that both antipsychotics produced time-dependent and protracted deficits in the performance of a water maze procedure when compared with vehicle-treated controls, while neither drug was associated with significant alterations in radial arm maze performance. Interestingly, haloperidol, but not risperidone, was detectible in the rodent brain in appreciable levels for up to 2 weeks after drug discontinuation. Both antipsychotics were also associated with reduced levels of NGF protein in the basal forebrain and prefrontal cortex and significant (or nearly significant) decreases in phosphorylated tropomyosin-receptor kinase A (TrkA) protein and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (depending on the brain region analyzed). Neither antipsychotic markedly affected TrkA or p75 neurotrophin receptor levels. These data in rats indicate that chronic treatment with either haloperidol or risperidone may be associated with protracted negative effects on cognitive function as well as important neurotrophin and neurotransmitter pathways that support cognition.",,United States,2007,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.09.014,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17942237

A psychostimulant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), is currently a worldwide abused drug of choice. We decided to examine the modulating effects of long-term, compulsive treadmill exercise on the hedonic value of MDMA in male C57BL/6J mice. MDMA-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) was used as a behavioral paradigm to indicate the reward efficacy of MDMA. We observed that sedentary control mice all demonstrated reliable MDMA-induced CPP with our conditioning protocol. Interestingly, pre-exposure to a treadmill exercise decreased the later MDMA-induced CPP in a running period-dependent manner. Specifically, mice undergoing a 12-week treadmill running exercise did not exhibit any approaching bias toward the MDMA-associated compartment in this CPP paradigm. Twelve weeks of treadmill running did not alter peripheral metabolism of MDMA 30min following single intraperitoneal injection of MDMA (3mg/kg). We further used microdialysis technique to study the underlying mechanisms for the impaired MDMA reward produced by the12-week exercise pre-exposure. We found that acute MDMA-stimulated dopamine release in nucleus accumbens was abolished in the exercised mice, whereas an obvious elevation of accumbal dopamine release was observed in sedentary control mice. Finally, the 12-week exercise program did not alter the protein levels of primary dopamine receptors, vesicular or membrane transporters in this area. We conclude that the long-term, compulsive exercise is effective in curbing the reward efficacy of MDMA possibly via its direct effect on reversing the MDMA-stimulated dopamine release in nucleus accumbens.",,Netherlands,2008,10.1016/j.bbr.2007.09.014,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17949827

Previous studies have shown that elevated levels of endogenous KYNA are associated with an increased firing of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons. In the present study, utilizing extracellular single unit cell recording techniques, the mechanism involved in this excitatory action of the compound was analyzed in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Administration of 4-chlorokynurenine (4-Cl-KYN; 25mg/kg, i.p.), which is converted to the selective NMDA glycine-site antagonist 7-chloro-kynurenic acid (7-Cl-KYNA), was found to increase firing rate and per cent burst firing activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons to the same magnitude as pretreatment of kynurenine (causing a 25-fold elevation in extracellular brain KYNA). Intravenous administration of the selective antagonist at the alpha7* nicotinic receptor methyllycaconitine (MLA; 1-4mg/kg) did not affect firing of VTA DA neurons, whereas intraperitoneal administration of this drug in a high dose (6mg/kg) was associated with a decreased firing rate and per cent burst firing activity. Administration of SDZ 220-581 (10mg/kg, i.v.), a competitive antagonist at the glutamate recognition-site of the NMDA receptor, was found to increase firing rate and per cent burst firing.

In vivo levels of dopamine transporters (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter-type 2 (VMAT2), amphetamine-induced dopamine release (AMPH-DAR), D2-dopamine receptors (D2R) and translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) were measured longitudinally in the striatum of MPTP-treated animals. We report an early (2 months) decrease (46%) of striatal VMAT2 in asymptomatic MPTP animals that preceded changes in DAT, D2R, and AMPH-DAR and was associated with increased TSPO levels indicative of a glial response. Subsequent PET studies showed progressive loss of all pre-synaptic dopamine markers in the striatum with expression of parkinsonism. However, glial cell activation did not track disease progression. These findings indicate that decreased VMAT2 is a key pathogenic event that precedes nigrostriatal dopamine neuron degeneration. The loss of VMAT2 may result from an association with alpha-synuclein aggregation induced by oxidative stress. Disruption of dopamine sequestration by reducing VMAT2 is an early pathogenic event in the dopamine neuron degeneration that occurs in the MPTP non-human primate model of PD.

Dysbindin expression is reduced in schizophrenic brain tissue, but the molecular mechanisms by which this contributes to pathogenesis and symptomatology are unknown. We studied the effects of transfection of DTNBP1 siRNA on cell surface levels of dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in rat primary cortical neurons. DTNBP1 siRNA decreased dysbindin protein, increased cell surface DRD2 and blocked dopamine-induced DRD2 internalization. MUTED siRNA produced similar effects. In contrast, decreased dysbindin did not change dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) levels, or its basal or dopamine-induced internalization. The DRD2 agonist quinpirole reduced phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) in dysbindin downregulated cells, demonstrating enhanced intracellular signaling caused by the upregulation of DRD2. This is the first demonstration of a schizophrenia susceptibility gene exerting a functional effect on DRD2 signaling, a pathway that has long been implicated in the illness. We propose a molecular mechanism for pathogenesis in which risk alleles in DTNBP1, or other factors that also downregulate dysbindin, compromise the ability of BLOC-1 to traffic DRD2 toward degradation, but has little effect on DRD1 trafficking. Impaired trafficking of DRD2 decreases dopamine-induced internalization, and with more receptors retained on the cell surface, dopamine stimulation produces excess intracellular signaling. Such an increase in DRD2 signaling relative to DRD1 would contribute to the imbalances in dopaminergic neurotransmission characteristic of schizophrenia.",,United States,2007,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1689-07.2007,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-17989303

Fluoxetine, a serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor, produced CPP in DD, but not control mice, suggesting that serotonin mediates cocaine CPP in DD mice. Inhibition of dopamine neuron firing by pretreatment with quinpirole, a dopamine D2-receptor agonist, blocked both cocaine- and fluoxetine-induced CPP in DD mice.

One goal of ageing research is to find drugs that would increase lifespan and vitality when given to an adult animal. To this end, we tested 88,000 chemicals for the ability to extend the lifespan of adult Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. Here we report that a drug used as an antidepressant in humans increases C. elegans lifespan. In humans, this drug blocks neural signalling by the neurotransmitter serotonin. In C. elegans, the effect of the drug on lifespan is reduced or eradicated by mutations that affect serotonin synthesis, serotonin re-uptake at synapses, or either of two G-protein-coupled receptors: one that recognizes serotonin and the other that detects another neurotransmitter, octopamine. In vitro studies show that the drug acts as an antagonist at both receptors. Testing of the drug on dietary-restricted animals or animals with mutations that affect lifespan indicates that its effect on lifespan involves mechanisms associated with lifespan extension by dietary restriction.

Abnormal pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors is thought to underlie the development of motor complications. There is thus a need for therapies that mimic the normal physiological state more closely by resulting in constant dopaminergic stimulation (CDS). Several studies support the hypothesis that CDS can reverse levodopa-induced motor complications. Other potential benefits of CDS include alleviating nocturnal disturbances, minimizing daytime sleepiness, avoiding priming for motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, preventing the development of gastrointestinal dysfunction and reducing the risk of developing psychosis or behavioural disturbances. Continuous infusion of dopaminergic therapies is impractical for the routine treatment of large numbers of patients. Although catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors or sustained-release preparations of levodopa may be beneficial, they do not entirely eliminate pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. A new dopamine agonist (rotigotine), delivered over 24 h by a once-daily transdermal patch, has been investigated in several clinical trials.

An intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (3-150 mg/kg) increased locomotor activity in a dose-dependent fashion. A low dose of ketamine (30 mg/kg) produced peak locomotion within the first 10 min followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, a high dose (150 mg/kg) inhibited locomotor activity to the control level during the first 30 min. Thereafter the activity gradually increased and reached a peak at approximately 2 h followed by a gradual decline. The hyperactivities induced by both low and high doses of ketamine were inhibited by a low dose of haloperidol (0.10 mg/kg, IP), a dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist. However, neither a high dose of phenoxybenzamine (10 mg/kg, IP), an alpha-blocker nor a high dose of propranolol (20 mg/kg, IP), a beta-blocker inhibited the hyperactivities. Destruction of catecholaminergic terminals by 6-hydroxydopamine suppressed ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Regional brain monoamine assays revealed that, at peak locomotion, a low dose of ketamine (30 mg/kg) selectively increased DA turnover in the nucleus accumbens which is a forebrain region believed to be involved in the initiation and regulation of locomotor activity, while a high dose (150 mg/kg) increased not only DA but also norepinephrine and serotonin turnover in many regions of the brain.

It has been hypothesized that antipsychotic drugs (APDs) used to treat schizophrenia restore normal activity by antagonizing the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor, which is also known to modulate key ionic currents in the PFC. However, the hypothesis that an under-active cortical DA system is responsible for schizophrenic symptoms has been challenged by evidence that newer atypical APDs are weak antagonists at the D2 receptor but potent antagonists at the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor . This review examines how DA and 5-HT modulate cortical activity and how they may interact in ways that are relevant to schizophrenia. It is concluded that although D2 receptor antagonism remains a critical factor in restoring impaired cortical activity, effects on 5-HT receptors may act in a synergistic manner on NMDA and GABA currents to potentiate antipsychotic actions in the PFC.",,Germany,2007,10.1055/s-2007-992133,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18080940

In a rat model of LID, we observed that animals of almost identical genetic but slightly different environmental backgrounds displayed a very different profile in terms of their development and severity of LID. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We hypothesised that this heterogeneity can be attributed to different levels of anxiety in individual animals. We evaluated the basal anxiety level of rats in this study using the elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF) test, and plasma corticosterone level. These animals then received unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathway after which they were primed to develop LID. Finally, we manipulated the anxiety level of these animals by citalopram treatment over a 9-week period before they were killed. RESULTS: Although we could not establish an association between the anxiety level of rats with either the onset or severity of LID, our results showed that citalopram was able to mediate a partial alleviation in LID after chronic treatment, and the extent of recovery was negatively correlated to the anxiety measures of individual animals. Furthermore, this citalopram-mediated LID recovery appeared to be independent of any changes in striatal cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) system, in contrast to our previous studies with fetal ventral mesencephalon transplants. However, chronic citalopram treatment almost completely abolished the expression of serotonin receptor 1B (5HT1B) in the striatum in animals exhibiting LID recovery.

This disturbance may stem from dysfunction of the amygdala, a brain region involved in fear processing. The present article describes a novel animal model of emotional blunting in schizophrenia. This model involves interfering with normal fear processing (classical conditioning) in rats by means of acute ketamine administration. We confirm, in a series of experiments comprised of cFos staining, behavioral analysis and neurochemical determinations, that ketamine interferes with the behavioral expression of fear and with normal fear processing in the amygdala and related brain regions. We further show that the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine, but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol nor an experimental glutamate receptor 2/3 agonist, inhibits ketamine's effects and retains normal fear processing in the amygdala at a neurochemical level, despite the observation that fear-related behavior is still inhibited due to ketamine administration. Our results suggest that the relative resistance of emotional blunting to drug treatment may be partially due to an inability of conventional therapies to target the multiple anatomical and functional brain systems involved in emotional processing. A conceptual model reconciling our findings in terms of neurochemistry and behavior is postulated and discussed.",,United States,2007,10.1371/journal.pone.0001360,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18159243

In nocturnal rodents, injections during the subjective day of the 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or its positive enantiomer, induce behavioral phase-advances in correlation with decreased expression of two clock genes, Per1/2. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine reduce light-induced phase-shifts during the subjective night. Beside the chronobiotic effects of serotonin, changes of serotonergic activity in humans have been involved in mood disorders, that are often associated with alterations in circadian rhythmicity. To get insights into the circadian role of serotonin in diurnal species, we investigated its modulation of the SCN in Arvicanthis ansorgei housed in constant darkness. In striking contrast to nocturnal rodents, daily serotonin content in Arvicanthis SCN peaked during daytime while the sensitivity window of its SCN to (+)8-OH-DPAT occurred essentially during the subjective night. Moreover, fluoxetine produced behavioral phase-advances at circadian time (CT) 0 and CT12. Expression of Per1/2, Rev-erbalpha/beta and Roralpha/beta in the SCN was not modified after fluoxetine or (+)8-OH-DPAT injection. Furthermore, both treatments enhanced light-induced phase-advances and delays. Light responses of Per1 and Rorbeta expression at CT0 and those of Per2 and Rev-erbalpha at CT12 were markedly altered by serotonergic activation. The present findings demonstrate that the serotonergic modulation of the SCN clock appears to differ between nocturnal species and the diurnal Arvicanthis.

Mice invalidated for the STOP gene display phenotype reminiscent of some schizophrenic-like symptoms, such as behavioral disturbances, dopamine (DA) hyper-reactivity, and possible hypoglutamatergia, partly improved by antipsychotic treatment. In the present work, we examined potential alterations in some DAergic key proteins and behaviors in STOP knockout mice. Whereas the densities of the DA transporter, the vesicular monoamine transporter and the D(1) receptor were not modified, the densities of the D(2) and D(3) receptors were decreased in some DAergic regions in mutant versus wild-type mice. Endogenous DA levels were selectively decreased in DAergic terminals areas, although the in vivo DA synthesis was diminished both in cell bodies and terminal areas. The DA uptake was decreased in accumbic synaptosomes, but not significantly altered in striatal synaptosomes. Finally, STOP knockout mice were hypersensitive to acute and subchronic locomotor effects of cocaine, although the drug equally inhibited DA uptake in mutant and wild-type mice.

The underlying mechanisms are unclear but may involve changes in 5-HT receptor levels and/or signalling. The present study used a novel 5-HTT overexpressing transgenic mouse to test the hypothesis that variability in 5-HTT expression may alter 5-HT(2A) receptor function. In wildtype mice, the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist DOI increased regional brain mRNA expression of two immediate early genes (c-fos and Arc), and induced head twitches, and both effects were abolished by pre-treatment with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist MDL 100907. In 5-HTT overexpressing mice, DOI induced a greater increase in both c-fos and Arc mRNA expression in cortical brain regions, and more head twitches, compared to wildtype mice. Autoradiographic and in situ hybridisation experiments showed that 5-HT(2A) receptor binding sites and 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA did not differ between transgenic and wildtype mice. Finally, the transgenic mice had lower regional brain 5-HT levels compared to wildtype mice. This depletion of 5-HT may underpin the increase in 5-HT(2A) receptor function because in wildtype mice 5-HT depletion using the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine, enhanced the head twitch response to DOI. These data demonstrate that elevated 5-HTT expression is accompanied by increased 5-HT(2A) receptor function, an effect possibly mediated by decreased availability of synaptic 5-HT. Variation in levels of 5-HTT expression may therefore be a source of variability in 5-HT(2A) receptor function, which may be an important modifier of 5-HTT-linked phenotypes.",,England,2008,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2007.12.001,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18241894

Abundant expression of the MCH receptor is observed outside the hypothalamus, especially in the dorsal and the ventral striatum, raising the possibility that MCH modulates the function of the midbrain dopamine neurons and associated circuitry. METHODS: The MCH receptor 1 (MCHR1) expression was assessed by in situ hybridization. Expression of dopamine transporter (DAT) and the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor (D1R and D2R) subtypes in the caudate-putamen (CPu) and the nucleus accumbens (Acb) was evaluated by immunoblotting. Amperometry in ex vivo slices of the Acb was used to measure evoked-dopamine release in MCH-/ - mice. Catalepsy in MCH+/+ and MCH-/- mice was assessed by the bar test after haloperidol injection. Locomotor activity was measured after acute and chronic treatment with amphetamine and after dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12909 administration. RESULTS: The psychostimulant amphetamine caused enhanced behavioral sensitization in MCH-/- mice. We found significantly elevated expression of the DAT in the Acb of MCH-/- mice. The DAT-mediated uptake of dopamine was also enhanced in MCH-/- mice consistent with increased expression of DAT. We also found that evoked dopamine release is significantly increased in the Acb shell of MCH-/- mice. The GBR 12909 administration increased the locomotor activity of MCH-/- mice significantly above that of MCH+/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that MCH, in addition to its known role in feeding and weight regulation, plays a critical role in regulating Acb dopamine signaling and related behavioral responses.",,United States,2008,10.1016/j.biopsych.2007.12.011,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18281019

This side effect, however, is absent or reduced for AAPD such as ziprasidone. The increased levels of appetite seen in rodents may be related to drug interactions with brain histamine systems involved in appetite control. We demonstrate a significant interaction of olanzapine treatment with histamine neurotransmission in a rat-feeding paradigm measuring the consumption of a palatable fat emulsion. This interaction was identified using the H3 receptor antagonist thioperamide, which by blocking autoreceptor control of histaminergic neurons enhances release of hypothalamic histamine, causing hypophagia. We challenged this effect of thioperamide with olanzapine, which among its pharmacological actions is a potent H1 receptor antagonist. Olanzapine pretreatment significantly attenuated thioperamide-induced hypophagia. Pretreatment of thioperamide with ziprasidone, an AAPD with negligible H1 receptor affinity, however, failed to have this effect. Although thioperamide may also increase levels of neurotransmitters other than histamine, the potent H1 antagonist property of olanzapine is likely to result in the suppression of thioperamide-induced hypophagia.

The present study examined brain membranes prepared from various species, including human, for the presence of site 2, defined as binding in the presence of (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a, d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate ((+)-MK801) minus binding in the presence of 10 microM TCP (nonspecific binding). Studies were conducted in absence of sodium which was found to be inhibitory to [3H]TCP binding. The results demonstrated detectable levels of site 2 in brain membranes of guinea pig, rabbit, pig, mouse, sheep, and human but not in the rat or chicken. Using human cortical membranes, site 2 was the predominant binding site. Detailed studies conducted with human cortical tissue showed that high-affinity dopamine (1-[2- [bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methoxy]ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazine (GBR12909)], [1,2]benzo(b)thiophenylcyclo-hexylpiperidine (BTCP), and serotonin (fluoxetine) uptake inhibitors produced a wash-resistant inhibition of [3H]TCP binding to site 2, but not site 1. Preincubation of guinea pig brain membranes with BTCP was shown to produce an increase in the dissociation rate of [3H]TCP from PCP site 2. Structure activity studies with various uptake inhibitors showed that GBR12909, benztropine, fluoxetine, and BTCP have higher affinity for site 2 than for site 1. (+)-MK801, ketamine, and tiletamine were very selective for site 1, whereas dexoxadrol and TCP were moderately selective for site 1. These results suggest that human cortex possesses high-affinity PCP binding sites associated with biogenic reuptake binding sites, and that guinea pig brain, but not rat brain, may be an appropriate animal model for studying PCP site 2 in human brain.",,United States,1991,10.1002/syn.890080407,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1833849

NPC 12626 (50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a degree of locomotor hyperactivity comparable to that seen with PCP (5 mg/kg). However, 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nucleus accumbens blocked the PCP-induced hyperactivity but not the behavioral activation evoked by NPC 12626. Single-unit extracellular recordings from ventral tegmental A10 dopamine neurons also found marked differences between the competitive and non-competitive NMDA antagonists. Intravenous injections of NPC 12626 and CGS 19755 in doses up to 60 mg/kg failed to change A10 activity. This was in contrast to the striking bimodal dose-dependent increase-decrease in firing rate elicited by PCP. The absence of an effect of NPC 12626 on A10 neurons was not evidently related to a lack of access to central sites since NPC pretreatment (40 mg/kg, i.v.) completely antagonized the neurotoxicity caused by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid, an NMDA agonist, but not that caused by the non-NMDA compound, kainic acid. Thus, competitive NMDA antagonists do not share PCP's properties of activating mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, and as such they may be devoid of the potent psychotomimetic effects or the abuse liability associated with non-competitive NMDA receptor blockers such as PCP.",,England,1991,10.1016/0028-3908(91)90131-t,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1836840

We here studied whether anticonvulsant compounds are antidepressant and can elevate hippocampal dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5-HT) levels determined by in vivo microdialysis in rats. We used assessment of seizure severity in the focal pilocarpine model, antidepressant-like activity within the rat forced swim and the mouse tail suspension tests, and locomotor activity in an open field as behavioural tests. We studied the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram and the selective DA reuptake blocker GBR-12909. These compounds with combined antidepressant-anticonvulsant properties all directly enhanced extracellular hippocampal DA or 5-HT levels.

The present study was further to examine the permissive role of renal nerve and dopamine in the renal action of ANF. Experiments were conducted on anesthetized rats with either acute unilateral ureter ligation (n = 8), reserpine pretreatment (10 mg/kg, n = 7), mechanically controlled renal arterial pressure (n = 8) or blockade of dopamine D1 receptors by SCH23390 (n = 8, 0.8 micrograms/kg.min). The arterial blood pressure and renal clearance responses to intravenous (0.30-0.45 micrograms/kg.min) or intrarenal (0.10-0.15 micrograms/kg.min) infusion of ANF were measured. The results showed that unilateral ligation of the ureter to physiologically inhibit the contralateral renal efferent nerve activity did not alter the depressor, diuretic and natriuretic effects of ANF. Reserpine pretreatment blunted the diuretic and natriuretic response to intravenous administration of ANF. However, ANF-induced diuresis and natriuresis was persistently observed in both kidneys of rats with the left renal arterial pressure being controlled at a level comparable to that seen in the reserpine-pretreated group. Blockade of intrarenal dopamine D1 receptors by SCH23390 completely abolished the diuretic and natriuretic response to intrarenal infusion of ANF.

Here we examine flexibility in the serotonin (5-HT) response system that modulates the cycle frequency (cf) of a rhythmic motor output. We found that depending on the preparation, the same 5-min bath application of 5-HT to the pyloric network of the California spiny lobster, Panulirus interruptus, could produce a significant increase, decrease, or no change in steady-state cf relative to baseline. Interestingly, the mean circuit output was not significantly different among preparations prior to 5-HT application. We developed pharmacological tools to examine the preparation-to-preparation variability in the components of the 5-HT response system. We found that the 5-HT response system consisted of at least three separable components: a 5-HT(2betaPan)-like component mediated a rapid decrease followed by a sustained increase in cf; a 5-HT(1alphaPan)-like component produced a small and usually gradual increase in cf; at least one other component associated with an unknown receptor mediated a sustained decrease in cf. The magnitude of the change in cf produced by each component was highly variable, so that when summed they could produce either a net increase, decrease, or no change in cf depending on the preparation.

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether or not oxidative stress can be induced into the antennal lobes of the honeybee brain by injecting ferrous ammonium citrate (FAC). Proboscis Extension Reflex conditioning procedure was used to assay subjects' responses to odorants for evaluating the effect of oxidative stress on the olfactory learning and memory. FAC-induced inhibitory effect on olfactory learning and memory was dose-and time-dependent. Injections of reduced glutathione (GSH) into the antennal lobes before FAC treatment blocked oxidative stress-mediated inhibitory effect. Injections of VK-28 prior to FAC treatment overcame oxidative stress-mediated inhibitory response. However, injections of GSH into the antennal lobes prior to mianserin/dsRNA treatment did not reverse octopamine receptor disruption-mediated inhibitory response. These results indicate that normal cellular redox is crucial for olfactory processing, and chelation of iron prevents ROS-mediated oxidative stress.

OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether behavioral alterations related to discrete aspects of schizophrenia are also induced by these PCP treatment regimes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following administration of vehicle or PCP according to the protocols described above, rats were assessed for attentional set shifting ability, prepulse inhibition (PPI), or social interaction and the locomotor response to a challenge dose of amphetamine. RESULTS: Ability to shift attentional set was impaired 72 h after the last PCP administration following the subchronic and chronic intermittent treatment regimes. PPI was disrupted after each acute administration of PCP in animals under the subchronic treatment regime. However, PPI deficits were not sustained 72 h after the last of five daily administrations. In subchronic and chronic PCP treated animals, no change was found in social interaction behavior, and there was little change in baseline or amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity, employed as an indicator of dopaminergic hyperfunction. CONCLUSIONS: The temporally distinct behavioral effects of these PCP treatment regimes suggest that PPI deficits relate directly to acute NMDA receptor antagonism, whereas the more enduring set shifting deficits relate to the longer term consequences of NMDA receptor blockade. Therefore, these subchronic and chronic PCP treatment regimes produce hypofrontality (Cochran et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 28:265-275, 2003) and associated prefrontal cortex-dependent deficits in behavioral flexibility which mirror core deficits in schizophrenia.",,Germany,2008,10.1007/s00213-008-1071-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18427784

Furthermore the properties of dopamine receptors and the levels of catecholamines of encephalopathic dogs were investigated. The mild stage of encephalopathy was characterized by an up-regulation of the inhibitory GABA-A receptors probably related to a decrese of GABA in nerve terminals since GAD was decreased and by a slight decrease of catecholamines and by an increased synthesis of octopamine associated with a decreased affinity of dopamine receptors. In the severe stage there was a selection of high affinity GABA-A receptors with an increased number of benzodiazepine recognition sites which were supersensitive to GABA stimulation, a decreased number of Dopamine D-2 receptors and a marked reduction of catecholamines.

Their inactivation is associated with anxiolytic and antidepressive properties but little information is available concerning cognition. This issue was addressed using the selective antagonists, SNAP-7941 and GW3430, in a social recognition paradigm in rats. The muscarinic blocker, scopolamine (1.25 mg/kg s.c.), reduced social recognition, an action dose-dependently blocked by SNAP-7941 and GW3430 (0.63-10.0 and 20.0-80.0 mg/kg i.p., respectively) which did not themselves display amnesic properties. Further, in a protocol where a spontaneous deficit was induced by a prolonged inter-session delay, SNAP-7941 and GW3430 dose-dependently enhanced social recognition. In dialysis studies, SNAP-7941 (0.63-40.0 mg/kg i.p.) and GW3430 (10.0-40.0 mg/kg i.p.) elevated extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the frontal cortex (FCX) of freely moving rats. The SNAP-7941 effect was specific, as it did not increase levels of ACh in ventral and dorsal hippocampus: moreover, it did not modify levels of noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and glutamate in FCX. Active doses of SNAP-7941 and GW3430 corresponded to doses (2.5-40.0 and 10.0-80.0 mg/kg i.p., respectively) exerting anxiolytic properties in Vogel conflict and ultrasonic vocalization tests, and antidepressant actions in forced swim, isolation-induced aggression and marble-burying procedures. In contrast to SNAP-7941 and GW3430, the benzodiazepine, diazepam, decreased social recognition and dialysate levels of ACh, while the tricyclic, imipramine, reduced social recognition and failed to enhance cholinergic transmission. In conclusion, at anxiolytic and antidepressant doses, SNAP-7941 and GW3430 improve social recognition and elevate extracellular ACh levels in FCX.

A review article.,Fitzgerald P and Dinan TG ,"Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)",,"Dopamine (DA) holds a predominant role in the regulation of prolactin (PRL) secretion. Through a direct effect on anterior pituitary lactotrophs, DA inhibits the basally high-secretory tone of the cell. It accomplishes this by binding to D2 receptors expressed on the cell membrane of the lactotroph, activation of which results in a reduction of PRL exocytosis and gene expression by a variety of intracellular signalling mechanisms. The hypothalamic dopaminergic neurons, which provide DA to the anterior pituitary gland, are themselves regulated by feedback from PRL through a 'short-loop feedback mechanism'. A variety of other modulators of prolactin secretion act at the hypothalamic level by either disinhibition of the dopaminergic tone (e.g. serotonin, GABA, oestrogens and opioids) or by reinforcing it (e.g. substance P). All typical antipsychotic medications are associated with sustained hyperprolactinaemia due to their high affinity for the D2 receptor and their slow dissociation from the receptor once bound, but atypicals differ quite dramatically in their propensity to cause prolonged high prolactin levels. Of those atypicals that are associated with prolactin elevation, the main causative factor appears to be a higher peripheral-to-central dopamine receptor potency of either the parent drug or its active metabolite (e.g. risperidone, 9-hydroxy-risperidone and amisulpride). Antipsychotics that easily cross the blood-brain barrier and exhibit fast dissociation from the dopamine receptor once bound do not result in sustained hyperprolactinaemia.",,United States,2008,10.1177/0269216307087148,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18477617

On the contrary, chronic treatment with the (-) enantiomer of oxaprotiline, which does not affect monoamine uptake, failed to produce this effect.

The evidence for down-regulation of 5-HT(2A) receptor binding following subchronic treatment with fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is mixed. The question of 5-HT(2A) receptor sensitivity during chronic administration of antidepressants is important since activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors is associated with impulsivity. Continued activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors may functionally oppose activation of other non-5-HT(2A) receptors in the prefrontal cortex associated with the clinical efficacy of SSRI treatment. Therefore, the effects of repeated daily administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p. x 3 weeks) on pharmacologically characterized electrophysiological response mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor activation, 5-HT-induced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), in rat prefrontal cortical slices was examined. The concentration-response curve for 5-HT-induced EPSCs was unchanged following subchronic fluoxetine treatment. This subchronic fluoxetine treatment failed to modify electrophysiological responses to AMPA in layer V pyramidal cells as well. These findings would be consistent with the hypothesis that blockade of 5-HT(2A) receptors may enhance the effects of SSRIs or serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).",,Ireland,2008,10.1016/j.neulet.2008.04.068,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18486339

As part of a study of the pharmacology of some 5-HT antagonists used in the treatment of migraine we have examined the interactions of these drugs with 5-HT and noradrenaline in rabbit isolated ear artery and aortic strip. The results provide new information on the distribution of 5-HT-receptors in these preparations. In the aorta, 5-HT and noradrenaline were of similar potency in producing contractions. Methysergide produced very small contractions and was about 1000 times less potent than the other two agonists. In the ear artery noradrenaline produced monophasic vasoconstrictor responses, whereas 5-HT and methysergide produced prolonged biphasic responses. 5-HT was about 700 times less potent and methysergide about 4500 times less potent than noradrenaline. Methysergide was a better agonist in the ear artery than in the aorta. Biphasic responses to 5-HT and methysergide were also obtained in ear arteries from reserpine-treated rabbits indicating that neither agonist was acting by releasing endogenous noradrenaline. Pizotifen, cyproheptadine and phentolamine had no agonistic actions in either the aorta or ear artery. In the aorta methysergide, pizotifen and cyproheptadine were potent antagonists of 5-HT and much weaker antagonists of noradrenaline. Phentolamine possessed the opposite profile of selectivity. These results show that there are distinct receptors for 5-HT and noradrenaline in rabbit aorta. In the ear artery the pA2 values for each of the four antagonists were virtually identical against 5-HT and noradrenaline and similar to those obtained on alpha-adrenoceptors in the aorta. We conclude that 5-HT and noradrenaline act directly at alpha-receptors to produce vasoconstriction in the ear artery and that this preparation does not contain specific 5-HT receptors. This insight into the distribution of 5-HT receptors and alpha-receptors allows interpretation of the various actions of methysergide. In the aorta, methysergide was a potent antagonist at 5-HT-receptors and a weak partial agonist at alpha-receptors. In the ear artery, methysergide was a partial agonist at alpha-receptors; it was only a weak antagonist of 5-HT because this preparation does not contain specific 5-HT-receptors. The cross-reactivity demonstrated throughout these experiments indicates that 5-HT-receptors and alpha-receptors, although distinct entities, have features in common. These results are discussed in relation to the mode of action of methysergide, pizotifen and cyproheptadine in the treatment of migraine.",,England,1976,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1976.tb10398.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-184872

The results obtained showed that infusions of 100 and 1000 ng of SP into the DH, but not VH, increased open arm activity in the EPM and in the central zone of the OF, indicative of anxiolytic-like action. These effects were observed in the absence of significant changes in general motor activity. In an additional experiment to examine whether these effects of SP are mediated by local serotoninergic mechanisms, extracellular concentrations of this monoamine were assessed by use of in vivo microdialysis. Infusions of SP into the DH did not influence the extracellular concentration of serotonin.

We now report that 5HT also regulates SMC growth through these same two mechanisms--a stimulatory event initiated intracellularly and inhibition of growth resulting from a cell surface action. 5HT (1 microM) plus 0.1 mM iproniazid (a 5HT metabolic inhibitor) produced a severalfold stimulation of DNA synthesis (as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation) of SMCs after a 17-24-hour incubation with only a slight elevation of cellular cAMP. This stimulatory effect responded synergistically with other growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and epidermal growth factor and was effectively reversed by 5HT uptake inhibition. It was not produced by 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, a metabolite of 5HT. In the presence of 1 microM 5HT plus 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), cAMP was elevated eightfold, dendritic formation occurred, and [3H]thymidine labeling of SMCs was inhibited. Inhibition of labeling by [3H]thymidine was mimicked by other agents that elevated cellular cAMP (10 microM histamine, 1 microM isoproterenol plus 0.1 mM IBMX, and 10 microM forskolin) and by 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP. This inhibitory effect was not blocked by either inhibition of 5HT uptake or 5HT-receptor antagonists ketanserin (5HT2); methiothepin, spiperone, and mianserin (5HT1/5HT2); and 3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate and 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (5HT3).

In VTA, bifeprunox and aripiprazole decreased (by 20-50%) firing of dopamine neurons. Interestingly, bursting activity was markedly reduced (by 70-100%), bursting being associated with a larger synaptic dopamine release than single spike firing. Both ligands reduced inhibition of firing rate induced by the full dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine, whereas the D(2) receptor antagonist haloperidol prevented these inhibitory effects, confirming partial D(2)-like agonistic properties. On 5-HT neurons, bifeprunox was more potent than aripiprazole to suppress firing activity. The 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 prevented their effects. In the USV test of anxiolytic-like activity, bifeprunox had higher potency than aripiprazole to reduce vocalisations. Both WAY-100,635 and haloperidol reversed the effects of both agonists.

OBJECTIVES: To explore the potential role of ovarian hormones in the regulation of dopamine (DA) neuron firing activity in ventral tegmental area (VTA) induced by acute cocaine in intact female or ovariectomized (OVX) rats. RESULTS: The basal firing activity of VTA DA neurons was changed in a manner phase-locked to the estrous cycle: being highest in estrus and lowest in proestrus. Acute cocaine produced greater inhibition (P < 0.05) on the firing of VTA DA neurons during proestrus than during estrus. The inhibitory effect was completely blocked by OVX and restored by replacement of 17-beta-estradiol or, to a less extent, by replacement of progesterone. In addition, we also detected female hormone-associated changes in slow oscillation in VTA DA neurons. The results indicate that ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen, not only synergize with the inhibitory effect of cocaine on VTA DA neuron activity but also play an essential role in maintaining the sensitivity of DA neurons to cocaine-mediated inhibition on firing. Moreover, pretreatment of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist raloxifene or a selective ERalpha antagonist Y134 largely attenuated the cocaine-inhibited DA neuron firing. We also found that cocaine-induced locomotor activity was estrous cycle dependent; 17-beta-estradiol but not progesterone replacement restored the cocaine-induced locomotor activity in OVX rats. CONCLUSION: The present results demonstrated that ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen, produce profound effect on VTA DA neuron activity, which, in turn, may contribute to the sex differences in response to psychostimulants.",,Germany,2008,10.1007/s00213-008-1188-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18516717

On the one hand, cannabis is the most widely used illegal drug. There is substantial evidence that cannabis has to be classified as an independent risk factor for psychosis that may lead to a worse outcome of the disease. This risk seems to be increased in genetically predisposed people and may depend on the amount of cannabis used. On the other hand, during the last few years, an endogenous cannabinoid receptor system (including two known cannabinoid [CB(1) and CB(2)] receptors and five endogenous ligands) has been discovered. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that, at least in a subgroup of patients, alterations in the endocannabinoid system may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (e.g., increased density of CB(1) receptor binding and increased levels of cerebrospinal fluid endocannabinoid anandamide). Accordingly, beside the 'dopamine hypothesis' of schizophrenia, a 'cannabinoid hypothesis' has been suggested. Interestingly, there is a complex interaction between the dopaminergic and the endocannabinoid receptor system. Thus, agents that interact with the cannabinoid receptor system, such as the nonpsychoactive cannabidiol, might be beneficial in the treatment of psychosis.",,England,2008,10.1586/14737175.8.7.1037,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18590475

However, the mechanisms involved in the vascular effect of trace amines have not been fully established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether trace amine-dependent vasoconstriction was brought about by tyramine and beta-PEA acting as indirect sympathomimetic agents, as previously assumed, or whether trace amine-dependent vasoconstriction could be mediated by recently discovered trace amine-associated (TAA) receptors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The responses to p-tyramine and beta-PEA were investigated in vitro in rings of the left anterior descending coronary arteries of pigs. KEY RESULTS: p-Tyramine induced a concentration-dependent (0.1-3 mM) vasoconstriction. The maximum response and pD(2) value for p-tyramine was unaffected by endothelium removal or pre-treatment with antagonists for adrenoceptors, histamine, dopamine or 5-HT receptors. beta-PEA also produced a concentration-dependent (0.3-10 mM) vasoconstriction which was unaffected by endothelium removal, beta-adrenoceptor or 5-HT receptor antagonists. A substantial, but reduced, response to beta-PEA was obtained in the presence of prazosin (alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), haloperidol (D(2)/D(3) dopamine receptor antagonist) or mepyramine (H(1) histamine receptor antagonist). The pD(2) value for beta-PEA was unaffected by any of the antagonists tested. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Vasoconstriction induced by p-tyramine does not involve an indirect sympathomimetic effect, although vasoconstriction caused by beta-PEA may occur, in part, by this mechanism. We therefore propose that trace amine-dependent vasoconstriction is mediated by phenylethylamine-specific receptors, which are closely related to or identical to TAA receptors.

This led us to evaluate the delayed effects of MDMA exposure on the 5-HT system, using in-vitro and in-vivo approaches in both 5-HTT wild-type and knock-out mice. Acute MDMA in-vitro application on slices of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) induced concentration-dependent 5-HT release and 5-HT cell firing inhibition. Four weeks after MDMA administration (20 mg/kg b.i.d for 4 d), a 2-fold increase in the potency of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist ipsapirone to inhibit the discharge of DRN 5-HT neurons and a larger hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT were observed in MDMA- compared to saline-treated mice. This adaptive 5-HT1A autoreceptor supersensitivity was associated with decreases in 5-HT levels but no changes of [3H]citalopram binding in brain. Long-term MDMA treatment also induced a 30% decrease in BrdU labelling of proliferating hippocampal cells and an increased immobility duration in the forced swim test suggesting a depressive-like behaviour induced by MDMA treatment. All these effects were abolished in 5-HTT-/- knock-out mice. These data indicated that, in mice, MDMA administration induced a delayed adaptive supersensitivity of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the DRN, a deficit in hippocampal cell proliferation and a depressive-like behaviour.

Among the proposed mechanisms of dopaminergic degeneration, oxidative stress is believed to play an important role. On the other hand, L-DOPA used as the main medication in PD and overproduction of dopamine (DA) in striatal neurons could elicit toxic effects due to formation of free radicals (FRs). Adenosine, an endogenous neuromodulator was shown in various experimental models to have neuroprotective properties. In our study, we investigated the role of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor ligands in hydroxyl radical generation by L-DOPA in the rat striatum. The hydroxyl radical was assayed by HPLC-ED as a product of its reaction with p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PBA). Intrastriatal infusion of L-DOPA(50 microM) markedly increased dialysate level of DA and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-DHBA). An adenosine A(1) receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA, 25-50 microM), nonselectiveA(1)/A(2A) receptor agonist 2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO, 50-100 microM), and selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS 21680 (25-50 microM) decreased the level of 3,4-DHBA. A non-selective A(1)/A(2A) adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine (100 microM) produced similar effect on 3,4-DHBA level. At the same time, CPA and 2-CADO, but not CGS 21680 or caffeine, decreased L-DOPA-induced DA release. The adenosine receptor ligands alone only weakly changed extracellular DA level and did not influence hydroxyl radical production. However, they showed scavenging activity in Fenton reaction in vitro. The primary caffeine metabolite in rodents, 1,3,7-trimethyl uric acid (1,3,7-mUA) decreased both, DA synthesis and 3,4-DHBA level. Thus, paradoxically, both agonists of A(1) receptor and agonist of A(2A) receptor as well as antagonist of A(1) and A(2A) receptors (caffeine), all decreased generation of FRs. Our study suggests that a decrease in hydroxyl radical generation caused by adenosine receptor ligands results from attenuation of L-DOPA-induced DA release or from their scavenging activity.",,Switzerland,2008,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18622056

OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of increases in serotonin following the administration of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) in SERT wild-type (+/+), heterozygous (+/-), and -/- mice. RESULTS: 5-HTP increased serotonin in all five brain areas examined with approximately 2- to 5-fold increases in SERT+/+ and +/- mice, and with greater 4.5- to 11.7-fold increases in SERT-/- mice. Behaviorally, 5-HTP induced exaggerated serotonin syndrome behaviors in SERT-/-, mice with similar effects in male and female mice. Studies suggest promiscuous serotonin uptake by the dopamine transporter (DAT) in SERT-/- mice, and here, the DAT blocker GBR 12909 enhanced 5-HTP-induced behaviors in SERT-/- mice. Physiologically, 5-HTP induced exaggerated temperature effects in SERT-deficient mice. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 decreased 5-HTP-induced hypothermia in SERT+/+ and +/- mice with no effect in SERT-/- mice, whereas the 5-HT7 antagonist SB 269970 decreased this exaggerated response in SERT-/- mice only. WAY 100635 and SB 269970 together completely blocked 5-HTP-induced hypothermia in SERT+/- and -/- mice.

However, we observed no suppression of mGluR-induced burst prolongation in the guinea pig hippocampal slice when applied in the presence of the PKC activator phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Furthermore, PDBu alone converted picrotoxin-induced interictal bursts into ictal-length discharges ranging from 2 to 6s in length. This effect could not be elicited by the inactive analog 4-alpha-PDBu and was suppressed with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine, indicating PKC dependence. PKC activation can enhance neurotransmitter release, and both glutamate and acetylcholine are capable of eliciting similar prolonged synchronized discharges. However, neither mGluR1 nor NMDA receptor antagonist suppressed PDBu-driven burst prolongation, suggesting that increased glutamate release alone is unlikely to account for the PKC-induced expression of ictaform discharges. Similarly, atropine, a broad-spectrum muscarinic receptor antagonist, had no effect on PKC-induced burst prolongation. By contrast, AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist abolished PKC-induced burst prolongation, and mGluR5 antagonist significantly blunted the maximum burst length induced by PKC. These data suggest that PKC-induced prolongation of epileptiform bursts is dependent on changes specific to mGluR5 and AMPA/kainate receptors and not mediated simply by a generalized increase in transmitter release.",,Netherlands,2008,10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.07.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18715754

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is affected by this disorder and shows an intense expression of the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a plasticity-associated molecule, which is expressed mainly in interneurons. The monoamines serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline are the principal targets of antidepressant action. Pharmacological manipulation of serotonin levels regulates synaptophysin and PSA-NCAM expression in the adult mPFC. However, the involvement of structural plasticity on the antidepressant effects of dopamine has not been well explored yet. Using immunohistochemistry, we have studied the relationship between dopaminergic fibers and PSA-NCAM expressing neurons in the mPFC and the expression of D2 receptors. In order to evaluate the effects of dopamine in neuronal structural plasticity and on inhibitory neurotransmission, we have analyzed the expression of synaptophysin, PSA-NCAM and GAD67 in the mPFC after cortical dopamine depletion with 6-OHDA and after chronic treatments with the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol or the D2 receptor agonist PPHT. Many dopaminergic fibers were observed in close apposition to PSA-NCAM expressing neurons and 76% of these cells co-expressed D2 receptor.

To study the contribution of different monoaminergic receptors (for which clozapine and haloperidol exhibit distinct affinities) to these effects, here we used in-vivo microdialysis to examine the role of local blockade of dopamine D2, 5-HT2A and alpha1-adrenergic receptors as well as agonism at dopamine D1 and 5-HT1A receptors in the mPFC on the increased efflux of glutamate and 5-HT elicited by MK-801.

Systemic or intra-amygdaloid application of the interfering peptide Tat-3L4F is able to disrupt PTEN coupling with 5-HT2cR in the rat VTA, resulting both in a suppression of the increased firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons induced by Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, and in a blockade of the conditioned place preference induced by THC and nicotine [Ji, S.P. et al. (2006). Nat. Med., 12: 324-329]. Because the blockade effects of Tat-3L4F peptide on the conditioned preference could be achieved by the suppression of Tat-3L4F peptide on the rewarding and/or learning/memory mechanisms associated with conditioned place preference, we recently explored whether Tat-3L4F can affect learning and memory. We observed that Tat-3L4F did not produce significant effects on spatial learning and memory in a Morris water maze test, thus indicating that Tat-3L4F can effectively suppress the rewarding effects induced by drugs of abuse.",,Netherlands,2008,10.1016/S0079-6123(08)00920-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18772044

The present study examined whether the reinstatement involves interactions between these receptors. Rats were trained to self-administer MAP with a light and tone (MAP-associated cues). Then, extinction sessions under saline infusion without cues were conducted. After that, a reinstatement tests were conducted by either presenting the cues or a MAP-priming injection. Systemic and intracranial administration of HU210, a cannabinoid CB1R agonist, into the nucleus accumbens core (NAC) and prelimbic cortex (PrC) reinstated MAP-seeking behavior. The reinstatement caused by the systemic HU210 treatment was attenuated by intracranial administration of AM251, a cannabinoid CB1R antagonist, into each region mentioned above. Meanwhile, reinstatement induced by the MAP-associated cues and MAP-priming injection was also attenuated by intracranial administration of AM251 in each region. In these regions, the attenuating effects of AM251 on the reinstatement induced by each stimulus were blocked by the intracranial administration of mecamylamine, a non-selective nAChR antagonist, but not by scopolamine, a muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) antagonist. Furthermore, the intracranial administration of DHbetaE, an alpha4beta2 nAChR antagonist, but not MLA, an alpha7 nAChR antagonist, into each region blocked the AM251-induced attenuation of the reinstatement. These findings suggest that relapses to MAP-seeking behavior may be due to two steps, first inhibition of ACh transmission by the activation of cannabinoid CB1Rs and then the inactivation of alpha4beta2 nAChRs.",,England,2008,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.08.012,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18782581

Using these models, the present study examined if the specific glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, RU-43044, has an antidepressant-like effect, and studied the possible role of prefrontal neurotransmission on the behavioral effects. Chronic administration of corticosterone and isolation rearing increased the immobility time in the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Subchronic treatment with RU-43044 decreased the immobility time in the forced swim test in chronic corticosterone-treated and isolation-reared mice, but not the control mice. Chronic corticosterone decreased the levels of cortical glucocorticoid receptors and stress-induced increases in plasma corticosterone levels, and blocked the response of plasma corticosterone to dexamethasone, while isolation rearing did not cause any changes in the glucocorticoid receptor system. Both chronic corticosterone and isolation rearing markedly increased high K+ -induced dopamine release, but not serotonin release, in the prefrontal cortex. Subchronic RU-43044 reversed the enhanced release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of chronic corticosterone-treated and isolation-reared mice. These results suggest that chronic corticosterone and isolation rearing increase the depressive-like behavior in glucocorticoid receptor-dependent and independent manners, respectively, and that RU-43044 shows an antidepressant-like effect, probably via an inhibition of enhanced prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission in these mouse models.",,England,2008,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.08.026,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18796307

This encourages interest in association of NK(1) receptor blockade with inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) reuptake. The selective NK(1) antagonist, GR205171, dose-dependently enhanced citalopram-induced elevations of extracellular levels of 5-HT in frontal cortex, an action expressed stereospecifically vs its less active distomer, GR226206. Further, increases in 5-HT levels in dorsal hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and striatum were likewise potentiated, and GR205171 similarly facilitated the influence of fluoxetine upon levels of 5-HT, as well as dopamine and noradrenaline. In parallel electrophysiological studies, the inhibitory influence of citalopram and fluoxetine upon raphe-localized serotonergic neurones was stereospecifically blunted by GR205171. Antidepressant actions of citalopram in a forced-swim test in mice were stereospecifically potentiated by GR205171, and it also enhanced attenuation by citalopram of stress-related ultrasonic vocalizations in rats. Further, GR205171 and citalopram additively abrogated the advance in circadian rhythms provoked by exposure to light in hamsters. By contrast, GR205171 stereospecifically blocked anxiogenic actions of citalopram in social interaction procedures in rats and gerbils, and stereospecifically abolished facilitation of fear-induced foot tapping by fluoxetine in gerbils. By analogy to GR205171, a further NK(1) antagonist, RP67580, enhanced the influence of citalopram upon frontocortical levels of 5-HT and potentiated its actions in the forced swim test.

NRG-1 regulates numerous neurodevelopmental processes and, in the adult, suppresses or reverses long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal glutamatergic synapses. Here we show that NRG-1 stimulates dopamine release in the hippocampus and reverses early-phase LTP via activation of D4 dopamine receptors (D4R). NRG-1 fails to depotentiate LTP in hippocampal slices treated with the antipsychotic clozapine and other more selective D4R antagonists. Moreover, LTP is not depotentiated in D4R null mice by either NRG-1 or theta-pulse stimuli. Conversely, direct D4R activation mimics NRG-1 and reduces AMPA receptor currents and surface expression. These findings demonstrate that NRG-1 mediates its unique role in counteracting LTP via dopamine signaling and opens future directions to study new aspects of NRG function. The novel functional link between NRG-1, dopamine, and glutamate has important implications for understanding how imbalances in Neuregulin-ErbB signaling can impinge on dopaminergic and glutamatergic function, neurotransmitter pathways associated with schizophrenia.",,United States,2008,10.1073/pnas.0805722105,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-18832154

This is one of the findings that support the hypothesis that NT is a neurotransmitter substance. The direct application of NT on CNS neurons causes predominantly excitatory effects. These effects occur in a dose-related fashion via a calcium-dependent postsynaptic mechanism. The C-terminal hexapeptide fragment, NT 8-13 exerts similar electrophysiological effects to NT, while the N-terminal octapeptide fragment, NT 1-8 is devoid of such activity. NT produces a significant increase in the firing rates of individual neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), ventral tegmental area (VTA), medial prefrontal cortex (MPF), hypothalamus, and periaqueductal grey (PAG). This excitation occurs with a rapid onset and is readily reversible after cessation of NT application. In contrast, NT has no effect or weak inhibitory effects on the firing rates of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and cerebellum. These electrophysiological actions of NT appear to be unique and not shared by other neurotransmitter and neuropeptide receptor antagonists and agonists that have been studied via direct co-application. NT attenuates dopamine (DA)-induced inhibition associated with direct application onto neurons in the SN and VTA both in vivo and in vitro. Intracellular recordings suggest that direct application of higher concentrations of NT appears to produce 'depolarization block' on individual neurons in the SN, VTA, MPF, and hypothalamus. The electrophysiological consequences of NT application not only show similarities to clinically efficacious antipsychotic medications, but also demonstrate the ability of NT to modulate the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons at the cellular level via specific NT binding sites. These findings further underscore the possibility that NT may play a pre-eminent role in the pathogenesis of, and psychopharmacological management of neurological and psychiatric disorders purportedly related to perturbation of CNS DA systems including schizophrenia.",,Netherlands,1991,10.1016/0024-3205(91)90300-z,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1890928

NT enhanced potassium (25 mM)-evoked ACh release from striatal slices in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was tetrodotoxin-insensitive, suggesting an action directly on cholinergic elements. The dopamine antagonist sulpiride (5 x 10(-5) M) significantly increased (63%) potassium-evoked ACh release from striatal slices; potassium-evoked ACh release was further increased (90%) in the presence of NT (10(-5) M) and sulpiride (5 x 10(-5) M). The second set of experiments tested the effects of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the substantia nigra on NT-induced increases of potassium-evoked ACh release. These lesions did not alter the NT regulation of potassium-evoked ACh release from striatal slices, but did significantly increase spontaneous (33%) and potassium-evoked (40%) ACh release from striatal slices. Striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was not affected by 6-OHDA lesions. In addition, following 6-OHDA lesions, sulpiride was ineffective in altering ACh release from striatal slices. Furthermore, evoked ACh release in the presence of the combination of NT and sulpiride was not different from that in the presence of NT alone. These results suggest that in the rat striatum, NT regulates cholinergic interneuron activity by interacting with NT receptors associated with cholinergic elements. Moreover, the NT modulation of cholinergic activity is independent of either an interaction of NT with D2 dopamine receptors or the sustained release of dopamine.",,England,1991,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1991.tb08199.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1899109

We therefore examined whether these dietary amines could exert pharmacological effects on the gut and its vasculature. In the present study we examined the effects of tyramine and beta-PEA on the contractile activity of guinea-pig and rat ileum and upon the isolated mesenteric vasculature and other blood vessels. Traditionally, these amines are regarded as sympathomimetic amines, exerting effects through the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve endings, which should relax the gut. A secondary aim was therefore to confirm this mechanism of action. However, contractile effects were observed in the gut and these were independent of noradrenaline, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin receptors. They were therefore probably due to the recently described trace amine-associated receptors. These amines relaxed the mesenteric vasculature. In contrast, the aorta and coronary arteries were constricted, a response that was also independent of a sympathomimetic action. From these results, we propose that after ingestion, trace amines could stimulate the gut and improve intestinal blood flow. Restriction of blood flow elsewhere diverts blood to the gut to aid digestion. Thus, trace amines in the diet may promote the digestive process through stimulation of the gut and improved gastrointestinal circulation.",,England,2009,10.1017/S0007114508123431,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19017420

Such a role was partially confirmed in vivo after revealing that systemically administered 5-HTR(2) agonists, such as quipazine, could induce some locomotor-like movements (LM) in completely spinal cord-transected (Tx) rodents. However, given the limited binding selectivity of currently available 5-HTR(2) agonists, it has remained difficult to determine clearly if one receptor subtype is specifically associated with LM induction. In situ hybridization, data using tissues from L1-L2 spinal cord segments, where critical locomotor network elements have been identified in mice, revealed greater 5-HTR(2A) mRNA levels in low-thoracic Tx than non-Tx animals. This expression level remained elevated for several days, specifically in the lateral intermediate zone, where peak values were detected at 1 week post-Tx and returned to normal at 3 weeks post-Tx. Behavioral and kinematic analyses revealed quipazine-induced LM in 1-week Tx mice either non-pretreated or pretreated with selective 5-HTR(2B) and/or 5-HTR(2C) antagonists. In contrast, LM completely failed to be induced by quipazine in animals pretreated with selective 5-HTR(2A) antagonists.

Results show that diazepam injections at a dose of 2 mg/kg daily for two weeks increased weekly food intake and growth rate. Anxiolytic effects of the drug monitored in a light/dark activity box were not significant after single administration. One week and two weeks of administration elicited anxiolytic effects, which were smaller after two weeks of administration as compared to one week, suggesting the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic profile of diazepam.

Although we take these feelings for granted, convergent lines of evidence suggest that sensations of 'warmth' may alter neural circuits controlling cognitive function and mood, including serotonergic circuits, in addition to those directly involved in thermoregulatory cooling. One mechanism through which sensations of warmth may modulate neural circuits controlling cognitive function and mood is the activation of temperature-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, including TRPv3 and TRPv4 which are active in the non-noxious thermal range, 27-42 degrees C, and subsequent activation of a subpopulation of brainstem serotonergic neurons.

We investigated here whether, conversely, chronic ethanol intake could induce 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor supersensitivity, thereby contributing to the maintenance of high ethanol consumption. C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a progressive ethanol intake procedure in a free-choice paradigm (3-10% ethanol versus tap water; 21 days) and 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor functional state was assessed using different approaches.

Furthermore, ethanol intake produced both an increased potency (+45%) of ipsapirone to inhibit the firing of 5-HT neurons, and a raise (+35%) in 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor-mediated stimulation of [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus. These data showed that chronic voluntary ethanol intake in C57BL/6J mice induced 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor supersensitivity, at the origin of a 5-HT neurotransmission deficit, which might be causally related to the addictive effects of ethanol intake.",,England,2008,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05733.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19094059

Selective drugs may prove beneficial for specific symptoms, for certain patient subpopulations, or both. However, network analyses of the brain and its dysfunction suggest that agents with multiple and complementary modes of action are more likely to show broad-based efficacy against core and comorbid symptoms of depression. Strategies for improved multitarget exploitation of monoaminergic mechanisms include triple inhibitors of dopamine, serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline reuptake, and drugs interfering with feedback actions of monoamines at inhibitory 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B) and possibly 5-HT(5A) and 5-HT(7) receptors. Specific subsets of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors mediating antidepressant actions are under study (e.g., 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(6)). Association of a clinically characterized antidepressant mechanism with a nonmonoaminergic component of activity is an attractive strategy. For example, agomelatine (a melatonin agonist/5-HT(2C) antagonist) has clinically proven activity in major depression. Dual neurokinin(1) antagonists/5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and melanocortin(4) antagonists/SRIs should display advantages over their selective counterparts, and histamine H(3) antagonists/SRIs, GABA(B) antagonists/SRIs, glutamatergic/SRIs, and cholinergic agents/SRIs may counter the compromised cognitive function of depression. Finally, drugs that suppress 5-HT reuptake and blunt hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocorticotrophic axis overdrive, or that act at intracellular proteins such as GSK-3beta, may abrogate the negative effects of chronic stress on mood and neuronal integrity.

Considerable evidence suggests that the role of DA transmission may be altered as a function of nicotine exposure. Using a combination of in vivo neuronal recording and behavioral conditioning, we report that chronic nicotine exposure induces a functional switch in the role of mesolimbic DA transmission. Thus, in nicotine-naive subjects, blockade of DA transmission potentiates the rewarding effects of sub-reward-threshold doses of nicotine and reverses the motivational valence of nicotine from aversive to rewarding. However, in animals treated chronically with nicotine, DA blockade switches previously sub-reward-threshold or rewarding doses of nicotine into aversion signals. Neuronal VTA recordings similarly revealed a functional switch in this DAergic neuronal circuit resulting in strongly increased sensitivity of the VTA DAergic system to nicotine administration and a tonic reduction in the baseline activity of VTA DAergic neurons. These results demonstrate a functional switch in the role of DAergic transmission during the acute versus chronic phases of nicotine exposure and suggest that mesolimbic DA transmission plays qualitatively distinct roles in the processing of nicotine's motivational effects as a function of drug exposure.",,England,2009,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2008.12.008,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19133278

Evidence for activation of cortical and subcortical dopamine systems by different mechanisms.",Fr<c3><a5>nberg O and Marcus MM and Ivanov V and Schilstr<c3><b6>m B and Shahid M and Svensson TH ,Psychopharmacology,,"RATIONALE: Asenapine, a psychopharmacologic agent developed for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, has higher affinity for 5-HT(2A/C,6,7) and alpha(2) adrenergic receptors than for D(2) receptors. Asenapine exhibits potent antipsychotic-like effects without inducing catalepsy, increases cortical and subcortical dopamine release, and facilitates cortical glutamatergic transmission in rats. In this study, we further analyzed the effects of asenapine on dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic systems in the rat brain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the effects of asenapine on (1) dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus using in vivo single cell recording, (2) release of dopamine and noradrenaline (medial prefrontal cortex), serotonin (frontal cortex), and dopamine (nucleus accumbens), using in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Systemic asenapine increased dopaminergic (0.001-0.2 mg/kg, i.v.) and noradrenergic (0.025-0.05 mg/kg i.v.) neuronal firing, and asenapine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg, s.c) increased cortical noradrenaline and serotonin output. Local asenapine administration increased all three monoamines in the cortex but did not affect accumbal dopamine output. Intra-VTA tetrodotoxin perfusion blocked asenapine-induced accumbal but not cortical dopamine outflow. CONCLUSION: Asenapine at doses associated with antipsychotic activity enhanced cortical monoamine efflux. Whereas the asenapine-induced dopamine increase in nucleus accumbens is dependent on activation of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA, the increase of cortical dopamine outflow involves largely a local action at nerve terminals. Our data provide further insight on the pharmacologic characteristics of asenapine that may have bearing on its clinical efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",,Germany,2009,10.1007/s00213-008-1456-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19198810

The current study determined whether these changes are accompanied by any elevation in the proportion of striatal dopamine receptors in the functional high affinity state (D(2) (High)), as observed in other preclinical models of psychosis. Male Lister hooded rats (20-24 days) were housed in groups of three or alone. On Day 36 postweaning locomotor activity was monitored for 60 min in a novel arena, and on Day 37 novel object discrimination was assessed using a 2 h intertrial interval. Three days later striata were collected, homogenized, washed three times to remove endogenous dopamine, and the proportion of D(2) (High) determined by competition between dopamine and 2.27 nM [(3)H]domperidone. Isolates were significantly more active than group housed controls for both ambulation and rears. Although both groups exhibited comparable levels of familiarization trial object exploration, group housed animals were able to discriminate between novel and familiar objects during the choice trial while isolates were not. Social isolation was associated with a highly significant elevation in the proportion of striatal D(2) (High), equivalent to a 3.3-fold increase (group 15.2% +/- 1.4%, isolate 49.8% +/- 4.8%; P < 0.0001, Student's unpaired t-test).

In an effort to elucidate aripiprazole's pharmacological activity in relation to clinically relevant fluctuation of dopamine D(2) receptor reserves, we compared the properties of aripiprazole to other antipsychotics, quetiapine, clozapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, risperidone and haloperidol, a dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist, bifeprunox, dopamine D(3) receptor modulators, BP897 (N-[4-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]naphthalene-2-carboxamide) and GR103691 (4'-Acetyl-N-[4-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]biphenyl-4-carboxamide), and a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist, buspirone using forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in clonal Chinese hamster ovary cell lines expressing low and high densities of human dopamine D(2S) receptors (hD(2S)-Low and hD(2S)-High, respectively). In hD(2S)-Low cells lacking receptor reserves for dopamine, all drugs antagonized dopamine responses, and their potencies correlated well with respective affinities. In hD(2S)-High cells possessing receptor reserves, all antipsychotics except aripiprazole antagonized dopamine responses, and their antagonist potencies were less than those in hD(2S)-Low cells treated with the equal dopamine concentration. In contrast, aripiprazole and bifeprunox acted as full agonists. BP897, GR103691 and buspirone acted as partial agonists. These data suggest that the level of receptor reserves influences antagonist potencies and side effects associated with antipsychotics.

Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter that plays a significant role in these physiological functions and neurological diseases. Whereas the entorhinal cortex receives profuse noradrenergic innervations from the locus coeruleus of the pons and expresses high densities of adrenergic receptors, the function of norepinephrine in the entorhinal cortex is still elusive. Accordingly, we examined the effects of norepinephrine on neuronal excitability in the entorhinal cortex and explored the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Application of norepinephrine-generated hyperpolarization and decreased the excitability of the neurons in the superficial layers with no effects on neuronal excitability in the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex. Norepinephrine-induced hyperpolarization was mediated by alpha(2A) adrenergic receptors and required the functions of Galpha(i) proteins, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A. Norepinephrine-mediated depression on neuronal excitability was mediated by activation of TREK-2, a type of two-pore domain K(+) channel, and mutation of the protein kinase A phosphorylation site on TREK-2 channels annulled the effects of norepinephrine. Our results indicate a novel action mode in which norepinephrine depresses neuronal excitability in the entorhinal cortex by disinhibiting protein kinase A-mediated tonic inhibition of TREK-2 channels.",,United States,2009,10.1074/jbc.M806760200,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19244246

The end result is over 4,000,000 smoking-related deaths annually worldwide and the largest source of preventable mortality in developed countries. Stress reduction, pleasure, improved cognition and other central nervous system effects are strongly associated with smoking. However, if nicotine activated ACh receptors found in muscle as potently as it does brain ACh receptors, smoking would cause intolerable and perhaps fatal muscle contractions. Despite extensive pharmacological, functional and structural studies of ACh receptors, the basis for the differential action of nicotine on brain compared with muscle ACh receptors has not been determined. Here we show that at the alpha4beta2 brain receptors thought to underlie nicotine addiction, the high affinity for nicotine is the result of a strong cation-pi interaction to a specific aromatic amino acid of the receptor, TrpB. In contrast, the low affinity for nicotine at the muscle-type ACh receptor is largely due to the fact that this key interaction is absent, even though the immediate binding site residues, including the key amino acid TrpB, are identical in the brain and muscle receptors. At the same time a hydrogen bond from nicotine to the backbone carbonyl of TrpB is enhanced in the neuronal receptor relative to the muscle type. A point mutation near TrpB that differentiates alpha4beta2 and muscle-type receptors seems to influence the shape of the binding site, allowing nicotine to interact more strongly with TrpB in the neuronal receptor. ACh receptors are established therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, smoking cessation, pain, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, autism and depression. Along with solving a chemical mystery in nicotine addiction, our results provide guidance for efforts to develop drugs that target specific types of nicotinic receptors.",,England,2009,10.1038/nature07768,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19252481

For example, the non-selective dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO), facilitates male sexual behavior in rats but inhibits it in quail. Although the general organization of the dopamine system is similar in birds and mammals, it is possible that the relative distribution and/or density of binding sites are different. We therefore compared the relative densities of D1-like and D2-like receptor subtypes in Japanese quail and rats, with the use of in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography. Brain sections from 8 male rats and 8 male quail were labeled with [(3)H]SCH-23390 and [(3)H]Spiperone. In general we found a systematic species difference in the relative density of D1- vs. D2-like receptors such that the D2/D1 ratio is higher in quail than in rats in areas, known to be important target sites for dopamine action such as striatal regions or the preoptic area, which is also associated with activation of sexual behavior. This difference might explain the variation in the behavioral effectiveness of APO in rats as compared to quail; with a higher relative density of D2-like receptors in quail, a similar dose of APO would be more likely to activate inhibitory processes in quail than in rats.",,Switzerland,2009,10.1159/000209864,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19321949

In all rats, scopolamine-resistant hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA), thought to be dependent on brain serotonin, maintained its normal relation to behavior, occurring in close correlation with Type 1 behaviors (postural changes, turning of the head, walking). This RSA was generally absent during stereotyped behavior (head weaving, forepaw treading, hindlimb splaying and tremor). Scopolamine-resistant neocortical low-voltage fast activity (LVFA), also though to be dependent on brain serotonin, was present during Type 1 behaviors and also during stereotyped behavior. Most rats that developed a full stereotyped behavior syndrome had behavioral and electrocortical seizures which were associated with a reduction in the amplitude of hippocampal activity. These seizures were suppressed by methysergide or benserazide. Metergoline (and methysergide to a lesser extent) suppressed the stereotypic behaviors of the serotonin syndrome, resulting in a striking increase in the locomotion caused by central serotonergic stimulation. Such locomotion was accompanied by RSA and LVFA. It was concluded that increased serotonergic activity in the CNS causes an increase in motor activity and a correlated increase in scopolamine-resistant hippocampal RSA and scopolamine-resistant neocortical LVFA and suggested that metergoline blocks serotonin receptors mediating stereotyped behaviors, thereby permitting the expression of serotonin-mediated locomotion.",,Netherlands,1991,10.1016/0006-8993(91)90351-u,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1933339

Oral dyskinesia developed rapidly, reaching a maximal level after 3 days.

The reserpine-treated rats also exhibited stereotypy in response to acute injection of the D1-selective agonist SKF-38393 (10 mg/kg), which was not observed in control rats. In contrast to the oral dyskinesia, this altered sensitivity to SKF-38393 returned to normal within 20 days after terminating the reserpine treatment, suggesting that these two behavioral responses involve different neural mechanisms. Quantitative autoradiographic measurement of dopamine receptor subtypes revealed that both D1 and D2 receptors were increased in the caudate-putamen (Cpu) and nucleus accumbens. Only the increase in D2 receptor density in the CPu correlated with the persistence of the oral dyskinesia; both changes persisted following termination of the reserpine treatment, and their magnitude was less at 60 days than at 1 and 20 days post-treatment.

Under control conditions, the catecholamine levels in coronary sinus blood increased linearly with increasing frequencies of stimulation up to 10 Hz and did not increase further at 30 Hz. The release of NE was markedly enhanced after PBA (1 mg/kg, iv) and DMI (1 mg/kg, iv). The enhanced release of NE after DMI, but not after PBA, was associated with a prolonged response in heart rate. In contrast, NE release was reduced after CLND (15 microgram/kg, iv) at stimulation frequencies of 1 and 2 Hz and this was associated with reduced responses in heart rate and left ventricular dtp/dt. STL (5 mg/kg, iv) reduced significantly the release of NE at stimulation frequencies of 1-5 Hz, whereas ISPR enhanced NE outflow at frequencies of 1-4 Hz. These results support the existence of both negative and positive feedback mechanisms on the release of norepinephrine by cardiac sympathetic fibers mediated through presynaptic alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, respectively. The functional significance of these mechanisms is also suggested by the correlation found between changes in NE release and variations in cardiac responses under the various drug treatements.",,United States,1977,10.1161/01.res.41.1.108,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-193655

These changes were correlated with behavioural alterations in rats. In vivo microdialysis with HPLC/ECD system revealed that there was a marked decrease in striatal neurotransmitter contents (NE, DA and 5-HT), which was also correlated with severe cataleptic response in rats after acute administration of haloperidol (2 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (20 mg/kg). Chronic administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg for 21 days) and chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg for 21 days) resulted in time dependent increase in orofacial hyperkinetic movements.

Kappa opioid receptors exist extensively in the brain and recent reports have suggested that these receptors are involved in modulating the release of several neurotransmitters including dopamine and serotonin. In the present study, we investigated the effect of TRK-820, (E)-N-[17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4,5alpha-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxymorphinan-6beta-yl]-3-(furan-3-yl)-N-methylprop-2-enamide monohydrochloride, a selective kappa opioid receptor agonist, on phencyclidine-induced rat behavioral changes and on biochemical changes in the prefrontal cortex. First, TRK-820 dose-dependently inhibited phencyclidine-induced rat hyperlocomotion, which is one of the abnormal behaviors recognized as a rodent schizophrenia model. The inhibitory effect was completely antagonized with nor-BNI (nor-binaltorphimine hydrochloride), a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist. Second, TRK-820 dose-dependently inhibited phencyclidine-induced stereotyped behaviors including head-weaving, which is considered a behavioral syndrome based on the impairment of the serotonergic system. Third, in an in vivo microdialysis study, TRK-820 dose-dependently attenuated the biochemical changes of both dopamine and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex of rats treated with phencyclidine without affecting their basal levels in normal rats.

In the moth, Agrotis ipsilon, the behavioral response and the neuron sensitivity within the primary olfactory centre, the antennal lobe (AL), to sex pheromone increase with age and juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis. By manipulating the JH level, we previously showed that JH controls this age-dependent neuronal plasticity, and that its effects are slow (within 2 days). We hypothesized that the hormonal effect might be indirect, and one neuromodulator candidate, which might serve as a mediator, is octopamine (OA). Here, we studied the effects of OA and an OA receptor antagonist, mianserin, on behavioral and AL neuron responses of mature and immature males during stimulation with sex pheromone. Our results indicate that, although OA injections enhanced the behavioral pheromone response in mature males, OA had no significant effect on behavior in immature males. However, mianserin injections decreased the behavioral response in mature males. AL neuron sensitivity increased after OA treatment in immature males, and decreased after mianserin treatment in mature males. Determination of OA levels in ALs of immature and mature males did not reveal any difference. To study the possible interactive effects of JH and OA, the behavioral pheromone response was analyzed in JH-deprived mature males injected with OA, and in immature males injected with fenoxycarb, a JH agonist, and mianserin.

However, it is not known if animals will also show cue-induced displacement of [(11)C]-raclopride binding. In this study, we use [(11)C]-raclopride imaging in awake rodents to capture cue-induced changes in dopamine release associated with the conditioned place preference model of drug craving. Ten animals were conditioned to receive cocaine in a contextually distinct environment from where they received saline. Following conditioning, each animal was tested for preference and then received two separate [(11)C]-raclopride scans. For each scan, animals were confined to the cocaine and/or the saline-paired environment for the first 25 min of uptake, after which they were anesthetized and scanned. [(11)C]-raclopride uptake in the saline-paired environment served as a within-animal control for uptake in the cocaine-paired environment. Cocaine produced a significant place preference (p = 0.004) and exposure to the cocaine-paired environment decreased [(11)C]-raclopride binding relative to the saline-paired environment in both the dorsal (20%; p < 0.002) and ventral striatum (22%; p < 0.05). The change in [(11)C]-raclopride binding correlated with preference in the ventral striatum (R(2) = -0.87; p = 0.003). In this region, animals who showed little or no preference exhibited little or no change in [(11)C]-raclopride binding in the cocaine-paired environment.

Here we show that some antipsychotic drugs produce significant functional changes in serotonergic neurons that directly impact feeding behavior in the model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans. In particular, antipsychotic drugs acutely suppress pharyngeal pumping, which is regulated by serotonin from the NSM neurons. By contrast, withdrawal from food and drug is accompanied by a striking recovery and overshoot in the rate of pharyngeal pumping. This rebound response is absent or diminished in mutant strains that lack tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1) or the serotonin receptors SER-7 and SER-1, and is blocked by serotonin antagonists, which implicates serotonergic mechanisms in this adaptive response. Consistent with this, continuous drug exposure stimulates an increase in serotonin and the number of varicosities along the NSM processes. Cyclosporin A and calcineurin mutant strains mimic the effects of the antipsychotic drugs and reveal a potential role for the calmodulin-calcineurin signaling pathway in the response of serotonergic neurons.

Serotonergic agonists and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine) have a non-photic influence (shifting effects during daytime and attenuation of photic resetting during nighttime) on hamsters' and mice' main clock. Surprisingly, in rats serotonergic modulation of the clock shows essentially photic-like features in vivo (shifting effects during nighttime). To delineate this apparent paradox, we analyzed the effects of fluoxetine and serotonin agonists on rats' clock. First, fluoxetine induced behavioral phase-advances associated with down-regulated expression of the clock genes Per1 and Rorbeta and up-regulated expression of Rev-erbalpha during daytime. Moreover, fluoxetine produced an attenuation of light-induced phase-advances in association with altered expression of Per1, Per2 and Rorbeta during nighttime. Second, we showed that 5-HT(1A) receptors -maybe with co-activation of 5-HT(7) receptors- were implicated in non-photic effects on the main clock. By contrast, 5-HT(3) and 5-HT(2C) receptors were involved in photic-like effects and, for 5-HT(2C) subtype only, in potentiation of photic resetting.

An alternative view is that functional adaptive changes may account for the manifestations of TD. A currently popular hypothesis is that there may be a functional excess in the activity of dopamine (DA) as a synaptic neurotransmitter in the basal ganglia. A cholinergic mechanism has also been implicated in TD, but the clinical effects of acetylcholine agonists and antagonists in TD are variable. In animals, nigrostriatal neurons respond to the blockade of DA synapses by treatment with antipsychotic agents in several ways, including acute and transient increases in the turnover of DA, and more slowly evolving ""disuse"" supersensitivity, possibly of postsynaptic receptors. The latter effects have been studied extensively in animal models of presumably DA-mediated behavior, by chemical studies of DA-sensitive adenylate cyclase in caudate nucleus in vitro, and by studies of labeled dopamine receptors. The phenomenon of DA-supersensitivity might help to explain some of the acute ""withdrawal dyskinesias"" that follow the abrupt discontinuation of high doses of antipsychotic agents, and might contribute to other reversible forms of the syndrome, but may be too short-lived to explain the persistent forms of TD.

In this investigation, we examined differences in the effects of aripiprazole and haloperidol on the conditioned fear response in methamphetamine-sensitized and fear-conditioned rats in an in vivo microdialysis study. Aripiprazole is the first antipsychotic drug with an action involving partial dopamine D(2) receptor agonism, thus differing from haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic that shows selective dopamine D(2) receptor full antagonism. After exposure to a conditioned stimulus, methamphetamine-sensitized rats exhibited significantly higher dopamine release in the amygdala than unsensitized rats. We considered this hypersensitivity of dopamine release to be a biochemical marker of hypersensitivity and vulnerability to stress in psychosis. In the present study, we found that aripiprazole and haloperidol equally suppressed the marked increase in extracellular dopamine levels in fear-conditioned rats, whereas haloperidol increased and aripiprazole decreased tonic dopamine levels. In conclusion, the effect of an antipsychotic drug is likely to be involved in attenuation of the phasic increase in dopamine associated with the fear response, at least in the amygdala. In addition, the contrasting effects of haloperidol and aripiprazole on tonic dopamine levels in the amygdala are likely due to the difference in their actions (selective dopamine D(2) receptor full antagonist vs. partial agonist, respectively).",,Netherlands,2009,10.1016/j.ejphar.2009.05.006,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19477171

Although the authors observed a greater density of 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity in H-Agg hamsters within several areas, it appears to be related to a lack of serotonin release, as supported by further observations of decreased immunoreactive perikarya and 5-HT1A receptors in fluoxetine-treated hamsters.

Towards this goal, the hyponeophagia assay was implemented whereby food-deprived mice show increased latency to begin feeding in a novel, anxiogenic environment. The non-selective serotonin agonist, 5-MeODMT, potentiates feeding inhibition compared to the inhibition generated by the anxiogenic environment in a drug-by-environment interaction. Thus, using hyponeophagia in mice, it was possible to study the following key components of AN: anxiety; feeding inhibition; and a modulatory role of the serotonergic system. A major prediction of the proposed AN model is that 5-HT(1A) receptor activation is necessary for feeding inhibition. In support of this model, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635, reverses the 5-MeODMT-dependent potentiation of feeding inhibition.

We hypothesized that the flattening of the diurnal glucocorticoid rhythm, commonly seen in bipolar disorder, modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) leading to abnormalities in prefrontally mediated neurocognitive functions. To address this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of a flattened glucocorticoid rhythm on (i) the release of dopamine in the PFC and (ii) the transcription of genes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) coding for proteins involved in presynaptic aspects of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Male rats were treated for 13-15 days with corticosterone (50 microg/ml in the drinking water) or vehicle (0.5% ethanol). Corticosterone treatment resulted in marked adrenal atrophy and flattening of the glucocorticoid rhythm as measured by repeated blood sampling. Animals treated with corticosterone showed markedly enhanced basal dopamine release in the PFC as measured by microdialysis in the presence of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Depolarization-evoked release was also enhanced, suggesting that the corticosterone effect on basal release did not result from an increase in the neuronal firing rate. Local blockade of terminal D(2) autoreceptors failed to normalize release to control values, suggesting that the enhanced release was not because of reduced autoreceptor sensitivity.

RESULTS: In this study we tested the rapid nongenomic effects of several physiological estrogens [estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estriol (E3)] on dopamine efflux via the DAT in a non-transfected, NGF-differentiated, rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell model that expresses membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha, beta, and GPR30. We examined kinase, ionic, and physical interaction mechanisms involved in estrogenic regulation of the DAT function. E2-mediated dopamine efflux is DAT-specific and not dependent on extracellular Ca2+-mediated exocytotic release from vesicular monoamine transporter vesicles (VMATs). Using kinase inhibitors we also showed that E2-mediated dopamine efflux is dependent on protein kinase C and MEK activation, but not on PI3K or protein kinase A. In plasma membrane there are ligand-independent associations of ERalpha and ERbeta (but not GPR30) with DAT. Conditions which cause efflux (a 9 min 10(-9) M E2 treatment) cause trafficking of ERalpha (stimulatory) to the plasma membrane and trafficking of ERbeta (inhibitory) away from the plasma membrane. In contrast, E1 and E3 can inhibit efflux with a nonmonotonic dose pattern, and cause DAT to leave the plasma membrane. CONCLUSION: Such mechanisms explain how gender biases in some DAT-dependent diseases can occur.",,England,2009,10.1186/1471-2202-10-59,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19531209

SERTs are not only targets for exogenous addictive and therapeutic agents but also can be modulated by endogenous, receptor-linked signaling pathways. We have shown that neuronal A3 adenosine receptor activation leads to enhanced presynaptic 5-HT transport in vitro and an increased rate of SERT-mediated 5-HT clearance in vivo. SERT stimulation by A3 adenosine receptors derives from an elevation of cGMP and subsequent activation of both cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. PKG activators such as 8-Br-cGMP are known to lead to transporter phosphorylation, though how this modification supports SERT regulation is unclear. RESULTS: In this report, we explore the kinase isoform specificity underlying the rapid stimulation of SERT activity by PKG activators. Using immortalized, rat serotonergic raphe neurons (RN46A) previously shown to support 8-Br-cGMP stimulation of SERT surface trafficking, we document expression of PKGI, and to a lower extent, PKGII. Quantitative analysis of staining profiles using permeabilized or nonpermeabilized conditions reveals that SERT colocalizes with PKGI in both intracellular and cell surface domains of RN46A cell bodies, and exhibits a more restricted, intracellular pattern of colocalization in neuritic processes. In the same cells, SERT demonstrates a lack of colocalization with PKGII in either intracellular or surface membranes. In keeping with the ability of the membrane permeant kinase inhibitor DT-2 to block 8-Br-cGMP stimulation of SERT, we found that DT-2 treatment eliminated cGMP-dependent kinase activity in PKGI-immunoreactive extracts resolved by liquid chromatography. Similarly, treatment of SERT-transfected HeLa cells with small interfering RNAs targeting endogenous PKGI eliminated 8-Br-cGMP-induced regulation of SERT activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that, in transporter/kinase co-transfected cells, PKGIalpha specifically associates with hSERT. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of a physical and compartmentalized association between SERT and PKGIalpha that supports rapid, 8-Br-cGMP-induced regulation of SERT. We discuss a model wherein SERT-associated PKGIalpha supports sequentially the mobilization of intracellular transporter-containing vesicles, leading to enhanced surface expression, and the production of catalytic-modulatory SERT phosphorylation, leading to a maximal enhancement of 5-HT clearance capacity.",,England,2009,10.1186/1756-6606-2-26,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19656393

(Clusiaceae), known as ""Pau Santo"", is used to treat several tropical diseases. The hydroethanolic extract (HE) of Kielmeyera coriacea stems and its semi-pure dichloromethane constituent (DCM) produced an anti-immobility effect in rats submitted to the forced swimming test (FST), suggesting a antidepressant-like profile. This study evaluated the effect of intra-median raphe nucleus (MRN) microinjection of 1,3,7-trihydroxy-2-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-xanthone, present in large quantity in the HE from Kielmeyera coriacea stems, on immobility behaviour in the FST in rats. The effects of xanthone were compared with intra-MRN microinjections of Way100635 (5-HT1A antagonist) or (+) 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A agonist). Locomotor activity in the open-field test (OFT) was evaluated as a complementary measure. Xanthone (0.3ng) or Way100635 (2.5microg) reduced, whereas (+) 8-OH-DPAT (5.0microg) increased immobility time in the FST. Way100635 (2.5 or 5.0microg) completely reversed the effects of (+) 8-OHDPAT (5.0microg), and potentiated the anti-immobility effect of the ineffective dose of xanthone (0.2ng) in the FST. The association of effective doses of (+) 8-OH-DPAT (5.0microg) and xanthone (0.3ng) annulled the effect of each compound on immobility time. These results suggest that xanthone acts as an antagonist at 5-HT1A autoreceptors in MRN and increases serotonin (5-HT) availability in projection regions, proving to be a prototype drug that may be useful in mood isorders such as depression, or indeed be a beneficial adjunctive treatment improving the efficacy and/or accelerating the effects of antidepressant drugs in patients with major depression.",,Germany,2010,10.1016/j.phymed.2009.07.002,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19674881

This effect is reduced or abolished by mutations that affect serotonin synthesis or serotonin reuptake at synapses. It also requires a serotonin receptor and an octopamine receptor, both of which are inhibited by the drug. Mianserin has no effect on the lifespan of animals with increased longevity due to dietary restriction or with a mutation that reduces food intake, indicating that the drug extends lifespan via mechanisms linked to dietary restriction.

Stimulation of NMDA receptors in nucleus accumbens (NAC) increases acetylcholine (ACh) release in prefrontal cortex (PFC), an activation thought to contribute to attentional processing. Thus, the effects of intra-NAC perfusion of NMDA (250-400 microM) on ACh release in PFC were determined in rats receiving lesions of the ventral hippocampus (VH) as neonates (nVHLX), a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, or as adults (aVHLX). NMDA elevated ACh release (100-150% above baseline) in adults sham-lesioned as neonates or in aVHLX rats. Adult nVHLX were unresponsive to NAC NMDA receptor stimulation. The inability of nVHLX to respond to NMDA emerged over development as a separate experiment demonstrated that evoked ACh release was normal before puberty (100-150% increase) yet, in these same nVHLX animals, absent after puberty. Amphetamine-evoked ACh release was assessed in nVHLX animals to exclude potential limitations in release capacity. Amphetamine produced greater increases in ACh release than in shams, indicating that nVHLX does not impair the capacity of cholinergic neurons to release ACh. Finally, the ability of 13 days of pretreatment with clozapine (1.25 mg/kg/day) to reinstate NMDA-evoked cortical ACh efflux was determined. Clozapine treatment normalized NMDA-evoked ACh release in nVHLX animals. These experiments show that mesolimbic regulation of cortical ACh release is disrupted in postpubertal nVHLX rats and normalized by low-dose treatment of clozapine; supporting the usefulness of nVHLX animals for research on the neuronal mechanisms underlying the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",,England,2009,10.1038/npp.2009.105,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19693002

To investigate the impact of MAO B deficiency on the emotional responses elicited by environmental cues, we tested MAO B knockout (KO) mice in a set of behavioral assays capturing different aspects of anxiety-related manifestations, such as the elevated plus maze, defensive withdrawal, marble burying, and hole board. Furthermore, MAO B KO mice were evaluated for their exploratory patterns in response to unfamiliar objects and risk-taking behaviors. In comparison with their wild-type (WT) littermates, MAO B KO mice exhibited significantly lower anxiety-like responses and shorter latency to engage in risk-taking behaviors and exploration of unfamiliar objects. To determine the neurobiological bases of the behavioral differences between WT and MAO B KO mice, we measured the brain-regional levels of PEA in both genotypes. Although PEA levels were significantly higher in all brain regions of MAO B KO in comparison with WT mice, the most remarkable increments were observed in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two key regions for the regulation of behavioral disinhibition. However, no significant differences in transcript levels of PEA's selective receptor, trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), were detected in either region.

However, it is unclear whether the DA neuron activation produced by antipsychotic drugs is due to feedback from post-synaptic blockade or is due to an action on DA neuron autoreceptors. This was evaluated using two drugs: the first-generation antipsychotic drug haloperidol that has potent D2 blocking properties, and the second-generation drug sertindole, which is unique in that it is reported to fail to reverse the apomorphine-induced decrease in firing rate typically associated with DA neuron autoreceptor stimulation. Using single-unit extracellular recordings from ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons in anaesthetized rats, both drugs were found to significantly increase the number of spontaneously active DA neurons (population activity). Apomorphine administered within 10 min either before or after sertindole reversed the sertindole-induced increase in population activity, but had no effect when administered 1 h after sertindole. Moreover, both sertindole- and haloperidol-induced increase in population activity was prevented when nucleus accumbens feedback was interrupted by local infusion of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline into the ventral pallidum. Taken together, these data suggest that antipsychotics increase DA neuron population activity via a common action on the nucleus accumbens-ventral pallidum-VTA feedback pathway and thus provide further elucidation on the mechanism by which antipsychotic drugs affect DA neuron activity.

The present studies were designed to determine the mechanism of these effects. Various doses of THC were incubated with either stalk median eminence fragments (MEs) or mediobasal hypothalamic (MBH) fragments in vitro. Although THC (10 nM) did not alter basal release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) from MEs in vitro, it completely blocked the stimulatory action of dopamine or norepinephrine on LHRH release. The effective doses to block LHRH release were associated with a blockade of synthesis and release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from MBH in vitro. In contrast to the suppressive effect of THC on LHRH release, somatostatin release from MEs was enhanced in a dose-related manner with a minimal effective dose of 1 nM. Since PGE2 suppresses somatostatin release, this enhancement may also be related to the suppressive effect of THC on PGE2 synthesis and release. We speculate that these actions are mediated by the recently discovered THC receptors in the tissue. The results indicate that the suppressive effect of THC on LH release is mediated by a blockade of LHRH release, whereas the suppressive effect of the compound on growth hormone release is mediated, at least in part, by a stimulation of somatostatin release.",,United States,1990,10.1073/pnas.87.24.10063,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1979873

In order to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms underlying hyperphagia in these animals, monoamine metabolism and turnover were studied in discrete hypothalamic nuclei known to participate in the control of feeding behavior. Neurochemical studies in genetically obese Zucker rats and in their lean littermate controls were complemented by investigating feeding behavioral responses to the acute administration of clonidine (15 and 30 micrograms/kg i.p.), an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, and to trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP; 1, 2 and 5 mg/kg s.c.), a putative serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine-1B receptor agonist. Obese Zucker rats had significantly lower concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the main deaminated metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptamine, in the nucleus paraventricularis (PVN) and in the nucleus ventromedialis (VMN), when compared to their lean littermate controls. The rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan after decarboxylase inhibition was reduced in the PVN, nucleus supraopticus, nucleus periventricularis and nucleus suprachiasmaticus of the obese rats. No differences were observed in basal concentrations of norepinephrine, dopamine or 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid between obese and lean Zucker rats in the brain areas studied. However, the rate of accumulation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine was lower in the VMN and in the median eminence of the obese rats. The feeding behavioral tests showed significantly augmented hyperphagic responses to clonidine in obese Zucker rats. The anorexic effect of TFMPP was similar in both phenotypes. It is concluded that serotonergic activity is reduced in obese Zucker rats, particularly in the PVN, which plays a key role in the control of feeding behavior. The reduced serotonergic activity may be associated with enhanced alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated feeding responses in obese Zucker rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Switzerland,1990,10.1159/000125635,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-1980723

Quantitative autoradiography using 3H-SCH-23390 and 3H-spiperone did not reveal any alteration of DA D1 and D2 receptor binding in the denervated regions studied. Furthermore, no change in the Bmax or Kd of 3H-SCH-23390 or 3H-spiperone in vitro binding was observed in membrane preparations of striatum following the neonatal DA lesion.

No alteration of the immunoreactivity of the D1 receptor associated phosphoprotein dopamine- and adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32), was observed as visualized using quantitative immunohistochemistry. Thus, neonatal DA lesions seem to induce a selective functional supersensitivity reflected by an enhanced activity of D1 receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase, without any alteration in the number of affinity of D1 and D2 receptor sites.

There is very strong evidence implicating a dysfunctional muscarinic system in schizophrenia, +with less information available for bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. The translation of this evidence into clinically viable treatments has been disappointing; hampered by problems associated with developing drugs that target the requisite members of the muscarinic family, rather than all of the receptors, which results in unacceptable side-effect profiles. The discovery of additional binding sites, other than the one occupied by acetylcholine, has revitalised research into this aspect of psychopharmacology. New compounds are now being developed that have the potential to selectively target individual muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system. The question that remains to be answered is whether stimulating central muscarinic receptors will result in the reestablishment of normal central muscarinic activity? The purpose of this review is to (i) summarise the data supporting a role of the muscarinic system in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder, and (ii) give an overview of some of the new selective muscarinic ligands that are currently in development and try to address the issue of re-establishing appropriate central muscarinic function.",,Switzerland,2009,10.1159/000231896,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19816066

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is an endogenous neuropeptide that induces a variety of behavioural changes including arousal and antinociception. In the present study, we explored whether the activity of LC noradrenergic neurons is modulated by TRH. Using current-clamp recording from isolated rat LC neurons, we found that TRH increased the firing rate of spontaneous action potentials. The TRH action was mimicked by TRH analogues including taltirelin and TRH-gly. In voltage-clamp recording at a holding potential of 50 mV, TRH produced an inward current associated with a decrease in the membrane K+ conductance. This current was inhibited by the TRH receptor antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Following inhibition of the pH-sensitive K+ conductance by extracellular acidification, the TRH response was fully inhibited. The TRH-induced current was also inhibited by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122, but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine nor by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA. The recovery from the facilitatory action of TRH on the spike frequency was markedly inhibited by a high concentration of wortmannin. These results suggest that TRH activates LC noradrenergic neurons by decreasing an acid-sensitive K+ conductance via PLC-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The present findings demonstrate that TRH activates LC neurons and characterize the underlying signalling mechanisms. The action of TRH on LC neurons may influence a variety of CNS functions related to the noradrenergic system which include arousal and analgesia.",,England,2009,10.1113/jphysiol.2009.181420,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19840999

It possesses analgesic, hypothermic, and antipsychotic-like properties. Neurotensin's effects are mediated mainly through two receptor subtypes, NTS1 and NTS2. Activation of NTS1 has been implicated in most of the pharmacological effects of neurotensin but is associated with hypothermia and hypotension. We report on a novel neurotensin analog with higher selectivity to NTS2, namely, NT79, which exhibits selective behavioral effects. NT79 was tested in animal models for pain (thermal-hot plate test; visceral-acetic acid-induced writhing test), and in animal models that are predictive of antipsychotic-like effects (apomorphine-induced climbing; d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity; disruption of prepulse inhibition). Its effects on body temperature and on blood pressure were also determined. Neurochemical changes in extracellular neurotransmitters were measured using in vivo microdialysis while the rats were simultaneously evaluated for acetic acid-induced writhing with and without pretreatment with NT79. Binding data at molecularly cloned hNTS1 and hNTS2 suggest selectivity for hNTS2. NT79 blocked the acetic acid-induced writhing with an ED(50) of 0.14 microg/kg while having no effect on thermal nociception. The writhing was paralleled by an increase in 5-HT which was attenuated by NT79. NT79 demonstrated antipsychotic-like effects by blocking apomorphine-induced climbing, d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and reducing d-amphetamine- and DOI-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition. Uniquely, it caused no significant hypothermia and was without effect on blood pressure.

725950ce-7684-4b90-af6f-b6104ae83ffb,Underlying mechanisms mediating the antidepressant effects of estrogens.,Osterlund MK ,Biochimica et biophysica acta,,"BACKGROUND: There is an increased risk for depressive symptoms and affective disorders in individuals who experience drastic drops or fluctuations of gonadal hormones. Moreover, clinical studies indicate that estrogens have the potential to be effective in treating depression. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: Possible underlying mechanisms for the antidepressant activity of estrogens are reviewed and discussed. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Estrogens exert their antidepressant activity via a multimodal mechanism of action by regulating several pathways and functions associated with antidepressive effects. Estrogens increase serotonergic activity by regulating the synthesis and degradation of serotonin, as well as spontaneous firing of the serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei. Both pre- and postsynaptic serotonin receptors are shown to be regulated by estrogens. In addition, estrogens are neurotrophic and promote neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Similar effects are also observed after treatment with current antidepressant therapies. However in stark contrast to current therapies which must be administered chronically to produce an effect, the responses to estrogens are often observed after a single dose. Many of these estrogenic effects, including antidepressant and anxiolytic responses in behavioral models in rodents, appear to be mediated via the estrogen receptor beta subtype. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The rapid onset of action combined with the multifactorial mechanism of action of estrogens indicates that estrogen treatment could complement currently available therapies for depression. Considering safety aspects, selective estrogen receptor beta agonists would probably be the optimal estrogenic therapy.",,Netherlands,2010,10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.11.001,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-19900508

OBJECTIVES: In this study, we examined locomotor responses of male and female juvenile and adult rats to a dose range of amphetamine. We also measured dopamine receptor and monoamine transporter densities in adult brain. RESULTS: Female DVD-deficient adult rats displayed an enhanced sensitivity to amphetamine-induced locomotion, an increased dopamine transporter density in the caudate-putamen and increased affinity in the nucleus accumbens compared with control females. By contrast, there were no differences between control and DVD-deficient male rats.

Among others, symptoms of depression, panic, aggression and suicidality have been associated with serotonergic dysfunction. Here we summarize the evidence that low brain 5-HT signals a metabolic imbalance that is evolutionarily conserved and not specific for any specific psychiatric diagnosis. The synthesis and neuronal release of brain 5-HT depends on the concentration of free tryptophan in blood and brain because the affinity constant of neuronal tryptophan hydroxylase is in that concentration range. This relationship is evolutionarily conserved. Degradation of tryptophan, resulting in lower blood levels and impaired cerebral production and release of serotonin, is enhanced by inter alia inflammation, pregnancy and stress in all species investigated, including humans. Consequently, tryptophan may not only serve as a nutrient, but also as a bona fide signalling amino acid. Humans suffering from inflammatory and other somatic diseases accompanied by low tryptophan levels, exhibit disturbed social behaviour, increased irritability and lack of impulse control, rather than depression. Under particular circumstances, such behaviour may have survival value.

Regional effects of L-NA (5,10 and 20mg/kg i.p.) on tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity, the rate limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, were determined by measuring accumulation of the transient intermediate 5-hydoxytryptophan (5-HTP) following in vivo administration of the amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015 (100mg/kg). L-NA (5-20mg/kg) dose dependently increased 5-HTP accumulation, particularly in the amygdaloid cortex, following exposure to the FST. L-NA also provoked an increase in regional brain 5-HIAA concentrations and in the 5-HIAA:5-HT metabolism ratio.

We have tested this hypothesis in 21-day-old rats by depleting catecholamine stores with reserpine. Northern blot analysis of NGF mRNA, in combination with a two-site enzyme immunoassay for NGF, showed that depletion of catecholamines was associated with a 3-fold increase in NGF mRNA, which was followed by a significant increase in the NGF content of cerebral cortex. The increase in NGF mRNA was most marked 9 hr after reserpine administration (2 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and was no longer apparent 24 hr after drug administration, when brain monoamine stores were still depleted. Moreover, the lowest dose of reserpine that significantly increased NGF mRNA levels induced only a small change in the content of cortical catecholamines. These results suggest that reserpine mediates the increase in NGF production by a mechanism other than monoamine depletion. Because reserpine increases plasma glucocorticoid concentrations through the pituitary-adrenal axis, we investigated whether adrenal steroids could be responsible for the induction of NGF biosynthesis. The effect of reserpine on NGF biosynthesis was abolished in adrenalectomized rats. Moreover, dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, subcutaneously, increased the amount of NGF mRNA and NGF in cerebral cortex.

The anti-immobility effect of the extract (30 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST was prevented by pre-treatment of mice with ketanserin (5 mg/kg, i.p., a preferential 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist), prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p., a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist) and SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist). The combined administration of a subeffective dose of WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist) and a subeffective dose of the extract (1 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a significant reduction in the immobility time in the TST. In addition, the combination of fluoxetine (1 mg/kg, p.o.), desipramine (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.), or bupropion (1 mg/kg, p.o.) with a subeffective dose of the extract (1 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a synergistic antidepressant-like effect in the TST, without causing hyperlocomotion in the open-field test. It may be concluded that the extract from T. avellanedae produces an antidepressant-like effect in the FST and in the TST that is dependent on the monoaminergic system. Taken together, our results suggest that T. avellanedae deserves further investigation as a putative alternative therapeutic tool that could help the conventional pharmacotherapy of depression.",,England,2010,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2009.12.010,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20026371

Our previous study demonstrated that the microinjection of N/OFQ into the vlPAG markedly facilitated nociceptive responses of spinal dorsal horn neurons. The aim of the present work was to further provide evidence for the supraspinal mechanisms of action for N/OFQ-mediated nociceptive facilitation by examining the effect of N/OFQ in the vlPAG on neurotransmitter release in the descending pain-control system, including the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis (NGC) and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The results showed that the microinjection of N/OFQ into the vlPAG produced robust decreases in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), norepinephrine (NE), and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and increase in glutamate (Glu) release in the spinal dorsal horn. Spinal application of 5-HT, 2-Me-5-HT (5-HT(3) receptor agonist), muscimol (GABA(A) receptor agonist), and baclofen (GABA(B) receptor agonist) significantly blocked intra-vlPAG-induced facilitation on nociceptive responses. However, the extracellular concentrations of these neurotransmitters in the NRM and NGC exhibited diversity following intra-vlPAG of N/OFQ. In the NRM, intra-vlPAG injection of N/OFQ significantly decreased 5-HT, NE, and Glu, but increased GABA release. Differently, in the NGC, both NE and GABA releases were attenuated by intra-vlPAG of N/OFQ, whereas the concentration of 5-HT and Glu exhibited a trend to increase. These findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that intra-PAG of N/OFQ-induced facilitation of nociceptive responses is associated with the release of 5-HT, NE, and amino acids.",,United States,2010,10.1016/j.pain.2009.11.025,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20036056

Most notably, OBX induces hyperlocomotion in response to the stress of exposure to a novel environment. We examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating this locomotor response in OBX and sham-operated rats. In our study, OBX-induced hyperactivity was restricted to the first 3 min of the open field test, demonstrating the presence of novelty (0-3 min) and habituation (3-30 min) phases of the open field locomotor response. Levels of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide were decreased in the ventral striatum, a brain region deafferented by OBX, whereas cannabinoid receptor densities were unaltered. In sham-operated rats, 2-AG levels in the ventral striatum were negatively correlated with distance traveled during the novelty phase. Thus, low levels of 2-AG are reflected in a hyperactive open field response. This correlation was not observed in OBX rats. Conversely, 2-AG levels in endocannabinoid-compromised OBX rats correlated with distance traveled during the habituation phase. In OBX rats, pharmacological blockade of cannabinoid CB(1) receptors with either AM251 (1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) or rimonabant (1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) increased distance traveled during the habituation phase. Thus, blockade of endocannabinoid signaling impairs habituation of the hyperlocomotor response in OBX, but not sham-operated, rats. By contrast, in sham-operated rats, effects of CB(1) antagonism were restricted to the novelty phase. These findings suggest that dysregulation in the endocannabinoid system, and 2-AG in particular, is implicated in the hyperactive locomotor response induced by OBX. Our studies suggest that drugs that enhance 2-AG signaling, such as 2-AG degradation inhibitors, might be useful in human brain disorders modeled by OBX.",,Netherlands,2010,10.1016/j.phrs.2009.12.013,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20044005

Significantly, both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (cholinoceptors) have been shown to have an important role in cognition and are therefore viewed as potential therapeutic targets for drugs designed to lessen cognitive deficits. Importantly, the demonstration that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which result in higher synaptic levels of acetylcholine, can reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia suggested that under-stimulation of cholinoceptors could be associated with the cognitive deficits associated with this disorder. This has lead to a focus on the development of receptor agonists, partial agonists and allosteric agonists that can be used to stimulate cholinergic pathways and thus reduce the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. In addition, muscarinic receptors have now been associated with the modulation of dopamine and may constitute an alternative target for the treatment of psychoses.

Evidence demonstrates that caffeine and selective adenosine A(2A) antagonists interact with the neuronal systems involved in drug reinforcement, locomotor sensitization, and therapeutic effect in Parkinson's disease (PD). Evidence also indicates that low doses of caffeine and a selective adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 elicit locomotor stimulation whereas high doses of these drugs exert locomotor inhibition. Since these behavioral and therapeutic effects are mediated by the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways which project to the striatum, we hypothesize that low doses of caffeine and SCH58261 may modulate the functions of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the neuroadaptations in the striatum by using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantitate the concentrations of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, dihydroxylphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA), and using immunoblotting to measure the level of phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) at Ser31, following chronic caffeine and SCH58261 sensitization in mice. Moreover, to validate further that the behavior sensitization of caffeine is through antagonism at the adenosine A(2A) receptor, we also evaluate whether chronic pretreatment with a selective adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 or a selective adenosine A1 antagonist DPCPX can sensitize the locomotor stimulating effects of caffeine. RESULTS: Chronic treatments with low dose caffeine (10 mg/kg) or SCH58261 (2 mg/kg) increased the concentrations of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, concomitant with increased TH phosphorylation at Ser31 and consequently enhanced TH activity in the striatal tissues in both caffeine- and SCH58261-sensitized mice. In addition, chronic caffeine or SCH58261 administration induced locomotor sensitization, and locomotor cross-sensitization to caffeine was observed following chronic treatment of mice with SCH58261 but not with DPCPX. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that low dosages of caffeine and a selective adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 elicited locomotor sensitization and cross-sensitization, which were associated with elevated dopamine concentration and TH phosphorylation at Ser31 in the striatum.

Most antipsychotic drugs disrupt active maternal responses (e.g., pup retrieval, pup licking and nest building). Our previous work shows that typical antipsychotic haloperidol disrupts maternal behavior by blocking dopamine D(2) receptors, whereas atypical clozapine works by blocking 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors. The present study used c-Fos immunohistochemistry technique, together with pharmacological tools and behavioral observations, and delineated the neuroanatomical bases of the disruptive effects of haloperidol and clozapine. Postpartum female rats were treated with haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg sc) or clozapine (10.0 mg/kg sc), with or without pretreatment of quinpirole (a selective dopamine D(2)/D(3) agonist, 1.0 mg/kg sc) or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-amphetamine (DOI, a selective 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, 2.5 mg/kg sc). They were then sacrificed 2 h later after a maternal behavior test was conducted. Brain regions that have been previously implicated in the regulation of rat maternal behavior and/or in the antipsychotic action were examined. Behaviorally, both haloperidol and clozapine disrupted pup retrieval, pup licking and nest building. Pretreatment of quinpirole, but not DOI, reversed the haloperidol-induced disruptions. In contrast, pretreatment of DOI, but not quinpirole, reversed the clozapine-induced deficits. Neuroanatomically, the nucleus accumbens (both the shell and core), dorsolateral striatum and lateral septum showed increased c-Fos expression to the treatment of haloperidol. In contrast, the nucleus accumbens shell showed increased expression of c-Fos to the treatment of clozapine. More importantly, pretreatment of quinpirole and DOI produced opposite response profiles in the brain regions where haloperidol and clozapine had an effect. Based on these findings, we concluded that haloperidol disrupts active maternal behavior primarily by blocking dopamine D(2) receptors in a neural circuitry involving the nucleus accumbens, dorsolateral striatum and lateral septum. In contrast, clozapine appears to disrupt maternal behavior mainly by blocking serotonin 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell.",,United States,2010,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.01.023,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20096751

However, the neurofunctional substrate of 5-HT(2A) antagonism and its exact contribution to the complex pharmacological profile of these drugs remain to be elucidated. OBJECTIVES: Here, we used pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging to map the modulatory effects of the selective 5-HT(2A)R antagonist Ml00907 on the spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity elicited by acute phencyclidine (PCP) challenge in the rat. PCP is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist that induces dysregulation of corticolimbic glutamatergic neurotransmission and produces cognitive impairment and psychotic-like symptoms reminiscent of those observed in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Pre-administration of M100907 produced focal and region-dependent attenuation of PCP-induced response in frontoseptohippocampal areas. As early studies highlighted a permissive role of 5-HT(2A)R on frontal dopamine release, the role of post-synaptic dopamine D(1) receptors on PCP-induced response was examined by using the potent antagonist SCH23390. Interestingly, SCH23390 did not affect PCP's response in any of the regions examined. This finding rules out a significant contribution of dopamine in the functional changes mapped and, indirectly, the inhibitory effect of M100907, in favour of a glutamatergic origin.

Dysfunction of this mesocorticolimbic system is critically involved in psychiatric disorders such as addiction and schizophrenia. Changes in VTA dopamine (DA) neuronal activity can alter neurotransmitter release at target regions which modify information processing in the reward circuit. Here we studied the effect of alpha-2 noradrenergic receptor activation on the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) in DA neurons of the rat VTA. Brain slice preparations using whole-cell current and voltage-clamp techniques were employed. Clonidine and UK14304 (alpha-2 receptor selective agonists) were found to decrease I(h) amplitude and to slow its rate of activation indicating a negative shift in the current's voltage dependence. Two non-subtype-selective alpha-2 receptor antagonists, yohimbine and RS79948, prevented the effects of alpha-2 receptor activation. RX821002, a noradrenergic antagonist specific for alpha-2A and alpha-2D did not prevent I(h) inhibition. This result suggests that clonidine might be acting via an alpha-2C subtype since this receptor is the most abundant variant in the VTA. Analysis of a second messenger system associated with the alpha-2 receptor revealed that I(h) inhibition is independent of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and resulted from the activation of protein kinase C. It is suggested that the alpha-2 mediated hyperpolarizing shift in I(h) voltage dependence can facilitate the transition from pacemaker firing to afferent-driven burst activity.

Its human analogue is the poorly understood anterior perforated substance. Previous work on rat brain slices identified two types of field potential responses from the OT. The association fibre (AF) pathway was sensitive to muscarinic modulation, whereas the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) fibre pathway was not. Here, we establish that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) also inhibits field potential excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in the AF, but not in the LOT fibre, pathway. Parallel experiments with adenosine (ADO) excluded ADO mediation of the 5-HT effect. Exogenous 5-HT at 30 microm caused a long-lasting approximately 40% reduction in the amplitude of AF postsynaptic responses, without affecting the time-course of EPSP decline, indicating a fairly restricted disposition of the 5-HT receptors responsible. The 5-HT(1)-preferring, 5-HT(5)-preferring and 5-HT(7)-preferring agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine caused similar inhibition at approximately 100 nm. The 5-HT(1A)-preferring ligand 8-hydroxy-di-n-propylamino-tetralin at 10 microm, and the 5-HT uptake inhibitor citalopram at 3 microm, caused inhibition of AF-stimulated field potential responses in the 5-10% range. Order-of-potency information suggested a receptor of the 5-HT(1B) or 5-HT(1D) subtype. The 5-HT(1D) agonist L-694,247 (1 microm) suppressed the AF response by approximately 10% when used on its own. After washing out of L-694,427, inhibition by 30 microm 5-HT was reduced to negligible levels. Allowing for a partial agonist action of L-694,427 and complex interactions of 5-HT receptors within the OT, these results support the presence of active 5-HT(1D)-type receptors in the principal cell layer of the OT.",,France,2010,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07084.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20141530

Peripheral NRG1 administration activated midbrain ErbB4 and elevated the expression, phosphorylation and enzyme activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which ultimately increased dopamine levels. The hyperdopaminergic state was sustained in the medial prefrontal cortex after puberty. There were marked increases in dopaminergic terminals and TH levels. In agreement, higher amounts of dopamine were released from this brain region of NRG1-treated mice following high potassium stimulation. Furthermore, NRG1-treated mice exhibited behavioral impairments in prepulse inhibition, latent inhibition, social behaviors and hypersensitivity to methamphetamine.

Dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists reduce the duration of licking bouts and mimic the effect of reducing sucrose concentration, while conflicting results are reported on the effects of dopamine D1-like receptor antagonists. The aim of this study is to examine the roles of dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptors in the activation of reward-associated responses and in reward evaluation, through the study of licking microstructure. METHODS: The effects of the dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists raclopride (0.025-0.25 mg/kg), the D1-like antagonist SCH 23390 (0.01-0.04 mg/kg) and the antipsychotic drug haloperidol (0.02-0.05 mg/kg), have been examined on the microstructure of licking for a 10% sucrose solution in rats. RESULTS: The results confirm that dopamine D2-like receptor antagonists reduce the duration of licking bouts and reveal that while SCH 23390 reduced licking exclusively by reducing bout number, raclopride produced on this measure an extinction mimicry effect similar to that observed in instrumental responding for different rewards. DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of activation of the responses to the reward-associated cues depends on dopamine D1-like receptor stimulation, and is updated, or ""reboosted"", on the basis of a dopamine D2-like receptor-mediated evaluation process occurring during the consummatory transaction with the reward.",,England,2010,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.01.017,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20149807

Here, T1AM was studied using rhesus monkey TAAR1 and/or human dopamine transporter (DAT) co-transfected cells, and wild-type (WT) and TAAR1 knock-out (KO) mice. The IC(50) of T1AM competition for binding of the DAT-specific radio-ligand [(3)H]CFT was highly similar in DAT cells, WT striatal synaptosomes and KO striatal synaptosomes (0.72-0.81 microM). T1AM inhibition of 10 nM [(3)H]dopamine uptake (IC(50): WT, 1.4 + or - 0.5 microM; KO, 1.2 + or - 0.4 microM) or 50 nM [(3)H]serotonin uptake (IC(50): WT, 4.5 + or - 0.6 microM; KO, 4.7 + or - 1.1 microM) in WT and KO synaptosomes was also highly similar. Unlike other TAAR1 agonists that are DAT substrates, TAAR1 signaling in response to T1AM was not enhanced in the presence of DAT as determined by CRE-luciferase assay. In vivo, T1AM induced robust hypothermia in WT and KO mice equivalently and dose dependently (maximum change degrees Celsius: 50 mg/kg at 60 min: WT -6.0 + or - 0.4, KO -5.6 + or - 1.0; and 25 mg/kg at 30 min: WT -2.7 + or - 0.4, KO -3.0 + or - 0.2). Other TAAR1 agonists including beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and methamphetamine also induced significant, time-dependent thermoregulatory responses that were alike in WT and KO mice. Therefore, TAAR1 co-expression does not alter T1AM binding to DAT in vitro nor T1AM inhibition of [(3)H]monoamine uptake ex vivo, and TAAR1 agonist-induced thermoregulatory responses are TAAR1-independent.

In this study, changes in dopamine and serotonin release induced by MAP (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) after pre-treatment with D1 and D2 receptor antagonists were examined in the striatum of rats with different alcohol preferences to elucidate differences in receptor levels between the two rat strains. D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 or D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol were administrated intracerebroventricularly 10 min before MAP stimulation. This study investigated the effect of methamphetamine-induced dopamine and serotonin release in striatum using microdialysis of freely moving rats coupled to ECD-HPLC. With haloperidol treatment both strains of rats showed a significantly greater maximum increase on MAP-induced dopamine release compared with respective control rats. However, after SCH23390 treatment only HAP rats showed a significantly greater increase in dopamine release compared with controls. SCH23390 blocks mainly D1 receptors only in the post-synaptic membrane, whereas haloperidol blocks D2 receptors in both the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic membranes. The MAP-induced increase in dopamine release following haloperidol pre-treatment was greater than SCH23390 pre-treatment in both strains. This result indicates that D2 receptors (autoreceptors) in the pre-synaptic membrane were blocked, leading to the elimination of the feedback function that regulates dopamine release. These data suggested that alcohol preference is associated with the action of MAP, and the dopaminergic mechanism, specifically the D1 system in the striatum, might have a different pathway dependent on alcohol preference.",,England,2010,10.3109/15376511003621658,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20163290

Here, we assess the extent to which this property may be optimized by the concomitant use of conventional antidepressants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that, in acute conditions, the 5-HT(4) agonist prucalopride was able to counteract the inhibitory effect of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) fluvoxamine and citalopram on 5-HT neuron impulse flow, in Dorsal RaphÃ© Nucleus (DRN) cells selected for their high (>1.8 Hz) basal discharge. The co-administration of both prucalopride and RS 67333 with citalopram for 3 days elicited an enhancement of DRN 5-HT neuron average firing rate, very similar to what was observed with either 5-HT(4) agonist alone. At the postsynaptic level, this translated into the manifestation of a tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, that was two to three times stronger when the 5-HT(4) agonist was combined with citalopram. Similarly, co-administration of citalopram synergistically potentiated the enhancing effect of RS 67333 on CREB protein phosphorylation within the hippocampus. Finally, in the Forced Swimming Test, the combination of RS 67333 with various SSRIs (fluvoxamine, citalopram and fluoxetine) was more effective to reduce time of immobility than the separate administration of each compound. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings strongly suggest that the adjunction of an SSRI to a 5-HT(4) agonist may help to optimize the fast-acting antidepressant efficacy of the latter.",,United States,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0009253,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20169084

Measurement of dopamine receptors by either standard binding techniques or autoradiography failed to demonstrate any receptor differences in the FSL and FRL rats. Behavioural studies with dopamine antagonists were less clear-cut, but suggested that the FSL rats might be more sensitive to their catalepsy-inducing effects.

Of various FABPs, heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP, FABP3) is highly expressed in neurons of mature brain and plays a role in arachidonic acid incorporation into brain and heart cells. However, the precise function of H-FABP in brain remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that H-FABP is associated with the dopamine D(2) receptor long isoform (D2LR) in vitro. Here, we confirm that H-FABP binds to dopamine D(2) receptor (D2R) in brain extracts and colocalizes immunohistochemically with D2R in the dorsal striatum. We show that H-FABP is highly expressed in acetylcholinergic interneurons and terminals of glutamatergic neurons in the dorsal striatum of mouse brain but absent in dopamine neuron terminals and spines in the same region. H-FABP knock-out (KO) mice showed lower responsiveness to methamphetamine-induced sensitization and enhanced haloperidol-induced catalepsy compared with wild-type mice, indicative of D2R dysfunction. Consistent with the latter, aberrant increased acetylcholine (ACh) release and depolarization-induced glutamate (Glu) release were observed in the dorsal striatum of H-FABP KO mice. Furthermore, phosphorylation of CaMKII (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) was significantly increased in the dorsal striatum. We confirmed elevated ERK phosphorylation following quinpirole-mediated D2R stimulation in H-FABP-overexpressing SHSY-5Y human neuroblastoma cells.

In this study, we investigated whether galantamine exerts cognitive-improving effects through the allosteric modulation of nAChRs in an animal model of methamphetamine (Meth) psychosis. The mice treated with Meth (1 mg/kg.d) for 7 d showed memory impairment in a novel object recognition test. Galantamine (3 mg/kg) ameliorated the memory impairment, and it increased the extracellular dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of Meth-treated mice. Donepezil, an AChE inhibitor (1 mg/kg) increased the extracellular ACh release in the PFC, whereas it had no effect on the memory impairment in Meth-treated mice. The nAChR antagonist, mecamylamine, and dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, blocked the ameliorating effect of galantamine on Meth-induced memory impairment, whereas the muscarinic AChR antagonist, scopolamine, had no effect. The effects of galantamine on extracellular dopamine release were also antagonized by mecamylamine. Galantamine attenuated the defect of the novelty-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). The ameliorating effect of galantamine on recognition memory in Meth-treated mice was negated by microinjection of an ERK inhibitor, PD98059, into the PFC. These results suggest that the ameliorating effect of galantamine on Meth-induced memory impairment is associated with indirect activation of dopamine D1 receptor-ERK1/2 following augmentation with dopaminergic neurotransmission in the PFC through the allosteric activation of nAChRs.

These midbrain dopaminergic nuclei and their respective forebrain and cortical target areas are well established as serving a critical role in mediating voluntary motor control, as evidenced in Parkinson's disease, and incentive-motivated behaviors and cognitive functions, as exhibited in drug addiction and schizophrenia, respectively. Although it cannot be disputed that excitatory and inhibitory amino acid-based neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and GABA, play a vital role in modulating activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, recent evidence suggests that acetylcholine may be as important in regulating dopaminergic transmission. Midbrain dopaminergic cell tonic and phasic activity is closely dependent upon projections from hindbrain pedunculopontine and the laterodorsal tegmental nuclei, which comprises the only known cholinergic inputs to these neurons. In close coordination with glutamatergic and GABAergic activity, these excitatory cholinergic projections activate nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors within the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area to modulate dopamine transmission in the dorsal/ventral striatum and prefrontal cortex. Additionally, acetylcholine-containing interneurons in the striatum also constitute an important neural substrate to provide further cholinergic modulation of forebrain striatal dopaminergic transmission.

Although KOR agonists decrease dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), KOR modulation of phasic dopamine release in the core and shell subregions of the NAc-which have distinct roles in reward processing-remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: Studies were designed to examine whether the time course of effects of KOR activation on phasic dopamine release in the NAc core or shell are similar to effects on motivated behavior. METHODS: The effect of systemic administration of the KOR agonist salvinorin A (salvA)-at a dose (2.0 mg/kg) previously determined to have depressive-like effects-was measured on electrically evoked phasic dopamine release in the NAc core or shell of awake and behaving rats using fast scan cyclic voltammetry. In parallel, the effects of salvA on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) and sucrose-reinforced responding were assessed. For comparison, a threshold dose of salvA (0.25 mg/kg) was also tested. RESULTS: The active, but not threshold, dose of salvA significantly decreased phasic dopamine release without affecting dopamine reuptake in the NAc core and shell. SalvA increased ICSS thresholds and significantly lowered breakpoint on the progressive ratio schedule, indicating a decrease in motivation. The time course of the KOR-mediated decrease in dopamine in the core was qualitatively similar to the effects on motivated behavior.

The objective of the current studies was to investigate the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of lurasidone. Receptor binding affinities of lurasidone and several antipsychotic drugs were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human receptors or membrane fractions prepared from animal tissue. Lurasidone was found to have potent binding affinity for dopamine D(2), 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)), 5-HT(7), 5-HT(1A), and noradrenaline alpha(2C) receptors. Affinity for noradrenaline alpha(1), alpha(2A), and 5-HT(2C) receptors was weak, whereas affinity for histamine H(1) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was negligible. In vitro functional assays demonstrated that lurasidone acts as an antagonist at D(2) and 5-HT(7) receptors and as a partial agonist at the 5-HT(1A) receptor subtype. Lurasidone showed potent effects predictive of antipsychotic activity, such as inhibition of methamphetamine-induced hyperactivity and apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior in rats, similar to other antipsychotics.

We have previously shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) released from enterochromaffin cells activates 5-HT(3) receptors on the mucosal processes of myenteric Dogiel type II neurons to initiate the events underlying the CMMC. Our aims were to further investigate the roles of 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(3), and 5-HT(7) receptor subtypes in generating and propagating the CMMC using intracellular microelectrodes or tension recordings from the circular muscle (CM) in preparations with and without the mucosa. Spontaneous CMMCs were recorded from the CM in isolated murine colons but not in preparations without the mucosa. In mucosaless preparations, ondansetron (3 microM; 5-HT(3) antagonist) plus hexamethonium (100 microM) completely blocked spontaneous inhibitory junction potentials, depolarized the CM. Ondansetron blocked the preceding hyperpolarization associated with a CMMC. Spontaneous CMMCs and CMMCs evoked by spritzing 5-HT (10 and 100 microM) or nerve stimulation in preparations without the mucosa were blocked by SB 258719 or SB 269970 (1-5 microM; 5-HT(7) antagonists).

The dopaminergic signal has been conceptualized to represent a prediction error that indicates the difference between received and predicted reward. The incentive salience hypothesis states that dopamine mediates the attribution of ""incentive salience"" to conditioned cues that predict reward. This hypothesis was initially applied in the context of drug addiction and then transferred to schizophrenic psychosis. It was hypothesized that increased firing (chaotic or stress associated) of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum of schizophrenia patients attributes incentive salience to otherwise irrelevant stimuli. Here, we review recent neuroimaging studies directly addressing this hypothesis. They suggest that neuronal functions associated with dopaminergic signaling, such as the attribution of salience to reward-predicting stimuli and the computation of prediction errors, are indeed altered in schizophrenia patients and that this impairment appears to contribute to delusion formation.",,United States,2010,10.1093/schbul/sbq031,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20453041

Based on the ability of the dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist raclopride to reduce bout size and to induce an ""extinction mimicry effect"" on bout number, we suggested that the level of activation of reward-associated responses is updated, or ""reboosted"", on the basis of a dopamine D2-like receptor-mediated evaluation process occurring during the consummatory transaction with the reward. Here we investigate the effects of the dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist raclopride (0, 25, 125, and 250microg/kg) on the microstructure of licking for water and sodium chloride solutions (0.075M, 0.15M, and 0.3M) in 12h water-deprived rats. In each session, rats were exposed to brief contact tests (1min) for each solution. Bout size, but not bout number, was decreased at the highest NaCl concentration. Raclopride reduced lick number owing to reduced bout size, while bout number was either not affected or even increased depending on the dose. These results are in agreement with the previous observations on sucrose licking, and suggest the involvement of dopamine D2-like receptors in an evaluation process occurring during the consummatory transaction with the reward.",,United States,2010,10.1016/j.pbb.2010.05.004,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20460136

The present study aimed to determine whether decreased 5-HT release and/or 5-HT(2A/C) receptor desensitization might play a role in tolerance by measuring the response to selective ligands following MDMA exposure. To this end, the latency to nose poke and emerge from a hide box to an open field arena following administration of various ligands to MDMA pre-treated and control rats was measured. Acute exposure to MDMA (0.0-3.3 mg/kg), the 5-HT releasing stimulant fenfluramine (0.0-2.0 mg/kg) and the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist m-CPP (0.0-1.25 mg/kg) increased nose poke and emergence latency. Following administration of doses that produce 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated behaviours, the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane failed to alter nose poke and emergence latency, suggesting a limited role of this receptor subtype in these behaviours. Activation of 5-HT(2C) receptors was implicated in the behavioural response to both MDMA and m-CPP since the increased emergence latency was dose-dependently attenuated by pre-treatment with the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist RS102221 (0.0-1.0 mg/kg). Tolerance to the behavioural effect of MDMA and fenfluramine but not m-CPP was produced by prior exposure to MDMA (10 mg/kg administered at two-hour intervals, total 40 mg/kg), and tissue levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were decreased. These findings suggest that tolerance to the increased nose poke and emergence latency produced by MDMA is due to impaired 5-HT release.",,United States,2010,10.1111/j.1369-1600.2010.00217.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20477756

This study investigated the long-lasting condition of cocaine sensitization as an inducing condition for anhedonia in rats. Cortical-mesolimbic dopamine plays a central role in assessing the incentive value of a stimulus and an increased dopamine output in these areas after a novel palatable meal seems to correlate with the ability to acquire an instrumental behaviour aimed at earning it again. This dopaminergic response is associated with consistent modifications in the phosphorylation pattern of some cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) substrates and it is mediated by dopamine D1 receptor stimulation. Thus, since behavioural cocaine sensitization is characterized by tonically increased levels of phospho-Thr75 DARPP-32 that is a potent PKA inhibitor, we hypothesized that cocaine-sensitized rats might reveal deficits in palatable food responding. Indeed, non-food-deprived cocaine-sensitized rats showed no interest in palatable food, no dopaminergic response after a palatable meal in terms of increased dopamine output and DARPP-32 phosphorylation changes, and no ability to acquire a palatable food-sustained instrumental behaviour. Repeated administration of an established antidepressant compound, imipramine, corrected these deficits and reinstated the dopaminergic response in the cortico-mesolimbic areas to control values. Thus, the behavioural modifications observed in cocaine-sensitized rats satisfy some requirements for an experimental model of anhedonia since they are induced by repeated cocaine administration (aetiological validity), they mimic an anhedonia-like symptom (construct validity), and are reversed by the administration of imipramine (predictive validity).",,England,2011,10.1017/S1461145710000532,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20519061

Information is conveyed to the VTA in large part by glutamatergic afferents that arise in various brain nuclei, including the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Using a unique rat brain slice preparation, we found that PPN stimulation activates afferents targeting GluR2-containing AMPA receptors (AMPAR) on VTA DA neurons, and these afferents did not exhibit long-term depression (LTD). In contrast, activation of glutamate afferents onto the same DA neurons via stimulation within the VTA evoked EPSCs mediated by GluR2-lacking AMPARs that demonstrated LTD or EPSCs mediated by GluR2-containing AMPA receptors that did not express LTD. Twenty-four hours after single cocaine injections to rats, GluR2-lacking AMPARs were increased at both PPN and local VTA projections, and this permitted LTD expression in both pathways. Single injections with the main psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), increased GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors and permitted LTD in only the PPN pathway, and these effects were prevented by in vivo pretreatment with the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251. These results demonstrate that cocaine more globally increases GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors at all glutamate synapses on VTA dopamine neurons, whereas Delta(9)-THC selectively increased GluR2-lacking AMPA receptors at subcortical PPN synapses. This suggests that different abused drugs may exert influence over distinct sets of glutamatergic afferents to VTA DA neurons which may be associated with different reinforcing or addictive properties of these drugs.",,United States,2010,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1507-10.2010,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20534838

Here we used patch-clamp recordings in rat olfactory bulb slices to assess cellular actions of NE, examining both acute, short-term effects of NE as well as the relationship between these acute effects and long-term cellular changes that could underlie learning. Our focus for long-term effects was on synchronized gamma frequency (30-70 Hz) oscillations, shown in prior studies to be enhanced for up to an hour after brief exposure of a bulb slice to NE and neuronal stimulation. In terms of acute effects, we found that a dominant action of NE was to reduce inhibitory GABAergic transmission from granule cells (GCs) to output mitral cells (MCs). This disinhibition was also induced by clonidine, an agonist specific for alpha(2) adrenergic receptors (ARs). Acute NE-induced disinhibition of MCs appeared to be linked to long-term enhancement of gamma oscillations, based, first, on the fact that clonidine, but not agonists specific for other AR subtypes, mimicked NE's long-term actions. In addition, the alpha(2) AR-specific antagonist yohimbine blocked the long-term enhancement of the oscillations due to NE. Last, brief exposure of the slice to the GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine, to block inhibitory synapses directly, also induced the long-term changes. Acute disinhibition is a plausible permissive effect of NE leading to olfactory learning, because, when combined with exposure to a specific odor, it should lead to neuron-specific increases in intracellular calcium of the type generally associated with long-term synaptic modifications.",,United States,2010,10.1152/jn.00328.2010,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20538781

Its role in mediating non-reproductive social relationships in rodents, however, remains largely unexplored. We examined whether OT facilitates same-sex social preferences between female meadow voles-a species that forms social nesting groups in short, winter-like day lengths. In contrast to results from studies of opposite-sex attachment between prairie vole mates, we found that neither OT nor dopamine neurotransmission was required for baseline levels of social partner preference formation or expression. OT enhanced preference formation beyond baseline levels-an effect that was counteracted by treatment with an oxytocin receptor antagonist (OTA). Oxytocin receptor (OTR) density correlated with social behavior in brain regions not known to be associated with opposite-sex affiliation, including the lateral septum and central amygdala. In addition, voles housed in short day lengths (SD) exhibited higher levels of OTR binding in the central amygdala, and voles exposed to high concentrations of estradiol exhibited less binding in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and increased binding in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. These results suggest that same-sex social behavior shares common elements with other mammalian social behaviors affected by OT, but that the specific neural pathways through which OT exerts its influence are likely distinct from those known for sexual attachments.",,United States,2010,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.05.023,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20580660

The present study investigated the mechanisms mediating this interaction. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with caffeine (10 mg x kg(-1); i.p.) and MDMA (15 mg x kg(-1); i.p.) alone and in combination. Core body temperatures were monitored before and after drug administration. KEY RESULTS: Central catecholamine depletion blocked MDMA-induced hyperthermia and its exacerbation by caffeine. Caffeine provoked a hyperthermic response when the catecholamine releaser d-amphetamine (1 mg x kg(-1)) was combined with the 5-HT releaser D-fenfluramine (5 mg x kg(-1)) or the non-selective dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine (1 mg x kg(-1)) was combined with the 5-HT(2) receptor agonist DOI (2 mg x kg(-1)) but not following either agents alone.

Here, we have investigated the effects of two TAs, tyramine (TYR) and beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), on electrophysiological responses of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopaminergic cells to the D(2) receptor agonist, quinpirole. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Electrophysiological recordings of D(2) receptor-activated G-protein-gated inward rectifier K(+) channel (GIRK) currents were performed on dopaminergic cells from midbrain slices of mice and on Xenopus oocytes expressing D(2) receptors and GIRK channels. KEY RESULTS: TYR and beta-PEA reversibly reduced D(2) receptor-activated GIRK currents in a concentration-dependent manner on SNpc neurones. The inhibitory effect of TAs was still present in transgenic mice with genetically deleted TA(1) receptors and they could not be reproduced by the selective TA(1) agonist, o-phenyl-3-iodotyramine (O-PIT). Pretreatment with antagonists of sigma1 and sigma2 receptors did not block TA-induced effects. In GTPgammaS-loaded neurones, the irreversibly-activated GIRK-current was still reversibly reduced by beta-PEA. Moreover, beta-PEA did not affect basal or dopamine-evoked GIRK-currents in Xenopus oocytes. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: TAs reduced dopamine-induced responses on SNpc neurones by acting at sites different from TA(1), sigma-receptors, D(2) receptors or GIRK channels. Although their precise mechanism of action remains to be identified, TAs, by antagonizing the inhibitory effects of dopamine, may render dopaminergic neurones less sensitive to autoreceptor feedback inhibition and hence enhance their sensitivity to stimulation.",,England,2010,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.00792.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20590640

Since BDNF signals via tropomyosine receptor kinases (trks), we tested whether trk blockade by repeated spinal injection of the trk inhibitor K252a would reduce anatomical (spinal noradrenergic and cholinergic fiber density), functional (Î±2-adrenoceptor-mediated direct stimulation of spinal cholinergic terminals), and behavioral (anti-hypersensitivity from systemic gabapentin and spinal clonidine) plasticity, which depends on BDNF. Spinal K252a treatment did not alter hypersensitivity from spinal nerve ligation (SNL), but blocked the SNL-associated increase in dopamine-Î²-hydroxylase (DÎ²H) fiber density in the spinal cord dorsal horn while reducing spinal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-immunoreactivity. K252a treatment also abolished the facilitatory effect of dexmedetomidine on KCl-evoked acetylcholine release in spinal cord synaptosomes and reduced the anti-hypersensitivity effects of oral gabapentin and spinal clonidine. These results suggest that spinal trk signaling is essential for the anatomic and functional plasticity in noradrenergic and cholinergic systems after nerve injury and consequently for the analgesia from drugs that rely on these systems.

Full understanding of serotonergic systems in the central nervous system involves genomics, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavior. Though associations have been found between functions at these different levels, in most cases the causal mechanisms are unknown. The scientific issues are daunting but important for human health because of the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other pharmacological agents to treat disorders in the serotonergic signaling system. METHODS: We construct a mathematical model of serotonin synthesis, release, and reuptake in a single serotonergic neuron terminal. The model includes the effects of autoreceptors, the transport of tryptophan into the terminal, and the metabolism of serotonin, as well as the dependence of release on the firing rate. The model is based on real physiology determined experimentally and is compared to experimental data. RESULTS: We compare the variations in serotonin and dopamine synthesis due to meals and find that dopamine synthesis is insensitive to the availability of tyrosine but serotonin synthesis is sensitive to the availability of tryptophan. We conduct in silico experiments on the clearance of extracellular serotonin, normally and in the presence of fluoxetine, and compare to experimental data. We study the effects of various polymorphisms in the genes for the serotonin transporter and for tryptophan hydroxylase on synthesis, release, and reuptake. We find that, because of the homeostatic feedback mechanisms of the autoreceptors, the polymorphisms have smaller effects than one expects. We compute the expected steady concentrations of serotonin transporter knockout mice and compare to experimental data. Finally, we study how the properties of the the serotonin transporter and the autoreceptors give rise to the time courses of extracellular serotonin in various projection regions after a dose of fluoxetine. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic systems must respond robustly to important biological signals, while at the same time maintaining homeostasis in the face of normal biological fluctuations in inputs, expression levels, and firing rates. This is accomplished through the cooperative effect of many different homeostatic mechanisms including special properties of the serotonin transporters and the serotonin autoreceptors.

Although 5-HT(2C) receptors are well known to be implicated in anxiety, their participation in stress-induced changes had not been investigated in parallel at both behavioral and neurochemical levels. We show here that the preferential 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, as well as restraint stress increased anxiety in the mouse social interaction test. The selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB 242,084, prevented both of these anxiogenic effects. Restraint stress increased 5-HT turnover in various brain areas, and this effect was prevented by the 5-HT(2B/2C) receptor agonist RO 60-0175 (1 mg/kg), but not the preferential 5-HT(2A) agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (1 mg/kg), and in contrast potentiated by SB 242,084 (1 mg/kg), which also blocked the effect of RO 60-0175. Using microdialysis, RO 60-0175 was shown to inhibit cortical 5-HT overflow in stressed mice when 5-HT reuptake was blocked locally. Chronic paroxetine prevented both the anxiogenic effect of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and the inhibitory effect of RO 60-0175 on locomotion and stress-induced increase in 5-HT turnover. The anxiolytic action of chronic paroxetine might be associated with an enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission caused by a decreased 5-HT(2C) receptor-mediated inhibition of stress-induced increase in 5-HT release.",,England,2010,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06932.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20796171

Alterations in dopamine (DA) receptor function in thalami of Schizophrenic patients have recently been reported. In addition, schizophrenia is associated with sensory gating abnormalities and sleep-wake disturbances, thus we examined the role of DA on neuronal excitability in somatosensory thalamus. The ventrobasal (VB) thalamus receives dopaminergic innervation and expresses DA receptors; however, the action of DA on VB neurons is unknown. In the present study, we performed whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings in rat brain slices to investigate the role of DA on excitability of VB neurons. We found that DA increased action potential discharge and elicited membrane depolarization via activation of different receptor subtypes. Activation of D2-like receptors (D(2R)) leads to enhanced action potential discharge, whereas the membrane depolarization was mediated by D1-like receptors (D(1R)). The D(2R-mediated) increase in spike discharge was mimicked and occluded by Î±-dendrotoxin (Î±-DTX), indicating the involvement of a slowly inactivating K(+) channels. The D1R-mediated membrane depolarization was occluded by barium, suggesting the involvement of a G protein-coupled K(+) channel or an inwardly rectifying K(+) channel.

This unique pharmacological profile makes it a promising novel antipsychotic candidate. Preliminary clinical trials and animal experiments suggest that l-SPD improves both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia without producing significant extrapyramidal side effects. To further explore the antipsychotic mechanisms of the drug, we studied the effects of l-SPD on the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) using in vivo single-unit recording technique in rats. RESULT: We found that l-SPD increased VTA DA neurons firing rate and induced slow oscillation in firing pattern. Moreover, l-SPD, not clozapine, reversed d-amphetamine-induced inhibition which induced an excitation of VTA DA neurons. Furthermore, our data indicated that the excitatory effect of l-SPD is associated with its partial agonistic action for the 5-HT(1A) receptor since the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 could block the l-SPD-induced excitatory effect. However, activation of 5-HT(1A) receptor alone by specific agonist (Â±)-8-Hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) was insufficient to elicit excitation of VTA DA neurons, but the excitation of 8-OH-DPAT on VTA DA neurons was elicited in the presence of Dâ‚‚-like receptors antagonist raclopride. Collectively, these results indicate that l-SPD excited VTA DA neurons requiring its Dâ‚‚-like receptors antagonistic activity and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonistic activity.

However, there is evidence that they may also have non-sympathomimetic mechanisms. This study examined whether Î²-PEA causes vasoconstriction of rat aorta by a sympathomimetic action or through the recently described trace-amine-associated receptors (TAAR). Concentration-response curves (CRCs) for Î²-PEA were constructed either cumulatively or non-cumulatively in rat isolated aortic rings. TAAR-1 and TAAR-4 protein expression was determined in rat aorta by Western blotting and TAAR-1 mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Î²-PEA caused concentration-related constriction of rat aorta. The contractions were unaffected by endothelium removal or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(Ï‰)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 100 Î¼M) or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 Î¼M). Non-cumulative CRCs showed greater contractions and sensitivity to Î²-PEA than cumulative. The Î±(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, failed to inhibit either curve. The Î²-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, the adrenergic neuronal transport inhibitor, cocaine, and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline, also failed to alter the CRC.

Recent data suggest that D2Rs form dimers in-vitro and in-vivo, and we hypothesized that schizophrenia, as well as preclinical models of schizophrenia, would demonstrate altered dimerization of D2Rs, even though the overall number of D2Rs was unaltered. METHODS: We measured the expression of D2Rs dimers and monomers in patients with schizophrenia using Western blots, and then in striatal tissue from rats exhibiting the amphetamine-induced sensitized state (AISS). We further examined the interaction between D2Rs and the dopamine transporter (DAT) by co-immunoprecipitation, and measured the expression of dopamine D2High receptors with ligand binding assays in rat striatum slices with or without acute amphetamine pre-treatment. RESULTS: We observed significantly enhanced expression of D2Rs dimers (277.7 Â± 33.6%) and decreased expression of D2Rs monomers in post-mortem striatal tissue of schizophrenia patients. We found that amphetamine facilitated D2Rs dimerization in both the striatum of AISS rats and in rat striatal neurons. Furthermore, amphetamine-induced D2Rs dimerization may be associated with the D2R-DAT protein-protein interaction as an interfering peptide that disrupts the D2R-DAT coupling, blocked amphetamine-induced up-regulation of D2Rs dimerization. CONCLUSIONS: Given the fact that amphetamine induces psychosis and that the AISS rat is a widely accepted animal model of psychosis, our data suggest that D2R dimerization may be important in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and may be a promising new target for novel antipsychotic drugs.",,England,2010,10.1186/1756-6606-3-25,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20813060

Chronic treatment with DA receptor agonists or antagonists is often used in pharmacotherapy, but the consequences of these treatments on DA neuron function are unclear. It was recently demonstrated that chronic D2 autoreceptor (D2R) activation in DA neurons decreases DA release and inhibits synapse formation. Given that DA neurons can establish synapses that release glutamate in addition to DA, we evaluated the synapse specificity of the functional and structural plasticity induced by chronic D2R activation. We show that chronic activation of the D2R with quinpirole in vitro caused a parallel decrease in the number of dopaminergic and glutamatergic axon terminals. The capacity of DA neurons to synthesize DA was not altered, as indicated by the lack of change in protein kinase A-mediated Ser(40) phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. However, the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons was decreased and was associated with altered intrinsic properties as revealed by a prolonged latency to first spike after release from hyperpolarization. Moreover, D2R function was decreased after its chronic activation. Our results demonstrate that chronic activation of the D2R induces a complex neuronal reorganization involving the inhibition of both DA and glutamate synapse formation and an alteration in electrical activity, but not in DA synthesis.

Among the five DA receptor subtypes, the D(4) subtype is of particular interest because of the relatively high affinity of the atypical neuropleptic clozapine for D(4) compared with D(2) receptors. GABA-containing neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and globus pallidus (GP) express D(4) receptors. TRN neurons receive GABAergic afferents from globus pallidus (GP), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), and basal forebrain as well as neighboring TRN neuron collaterals. In addition, TRN receives dopaminergic innervations from substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc); however, the role of D(4) receptors in neuronal signaling at inhibitory synapses is unknown. Using whole cell recordings from in vitro pallido-thalamic slices, we demonstrate that DA selectively suppresses GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by GP stimulation. The D(2)-like receptor (D(2,3,4)) agonist, quinpirole, and selective D(4) receptor agonist, PD168077, mimicked the actions of DA. The suppressive actions of DA and its agonists were associated with alterations in paired pulse ratio and a decrease in the frequency of miniature IPSCs, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, induced postsynaptic currents in TRN neurons were unaltered by DA or quinpirole, consistent with the presynaptic site of action. Finally, DA agonists did not alter intra-TRN inhibitory signaling. Our data demonstrate that the activation of presynaptic D(4) receptors regulates GABA release from GP efferents but not TRN collaterals. This novel and selective action of D(4) receptor activation on GP-mediated inhibition may provide insight to potential functional significance of atypical antipsychotic agents.

However, its actions at constitutively active 5-HT2CRs have yet to be characterized, an issue addressed herein. At unedited h5-HT2C(INI)Rs expressed in HEK-293 cells, 5-HT enhanced [35S]GTPÎ³S binding to GÎ±q, whereas the inverse agonists SB206,553 and S32006 inhibited binding and, by analogy to the neutral antagonist, SB242,084, agomelatine exerted no effect alone. Mirroring these observations, 5-HT stimulated, whereas SB206,553 and S32006 inhibited, [3H]inositol phosphate formation. Both the agonist actions of 5-HT and the inverse agonist actions of SB206,553 and S32006 were abolished by agomelatine and SB242,084. As demonstrated by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, 5-HT enhanced, whereas SB206,553 and S32006 decreased, association of 'h5-HT2C(INI)-Rluc-tagged' receptors with yellow-fluorescence-protein-coupled Î²-arrestin2. These actions of 5-HT, SB206,553 and S32006 were prevented by agomelatine and SB242,084 were ineffective alone. As shown by ELISA and confocal microscopy, prolonged (18 h) exposure to SB206,553 or S32006 enhanced cell surface expression of N-terminal Flag-tagged h5-HT2C(INI)Rs: these effects were blocked by agomelatine and SB242,084, which were inactive alone. Finally, following pre-exposure to SB206,553 or S32006 for 18 h, 5-HT triggered 5-HT2CR-mediated elevations in cytosolic Ca2+ in primary cultures of mice cortical neurons. Agomelatine and SB242,084, inactive alone, prevented these actions of SB206,553 and S32006. In conclusion, agomelatine behaves as a neutral antagonist at constitutively active h5-HT2C(INI)Rs and native, cortical 5-HT2CRs.

The pond snail, Lymnaea, shows multiple defensive vigilance behaviours in response to the stress associated with predator detection. Predator detection elicited by crayfish effluent (CE), increases the time to re-emerge from the shell and enhances the shadow withdrawal response. More importantly, in Lymnaea, CE enhances the ability to form long-term memory (LTM). We investigated the role of the serotonergic system in these anti-predator responses in Lymnaea. Using a serotonin-receptor antagonist, mianserin, we found that two defensive vigilance behaviours (e.g. increasing the time to re-emerge from their shell and shadow response) elicited by CE were not observed when the serotonergic system was disrupted. Also, methysergide, another serotonin antagonist, blocked the enhanced LTM formation after training in CE. Importantly, mianserin did not alter LTM formation in pond water (PW). These data suggest that a serotonergic system is activated only when Lymnaea detect a predator. When snails were trained in CE using a training procedure that in PW produces a 24-h LTM, a more persistent form of LTM (5 days) occurred. This more persistent form of LTM was abolished after mianserin treatment. Increasing 5-HT levels in the snail by the injection of 5-HT was also associated with enhanced LTM formation. Lastly, we tested whether the osphradium is implicated in CE detection and subsequent enhanced formation of LTM. Cutting the osphradial nerve to the CNS resulted in the loss of the ability to form enhanced LTM in CE. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that the serotonergic system plays a key role in modulating the predator-induced stress responses in Lymnaea.",,England,2010,10.1242/jeb.048256,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-20952608

Numerous biochemical and behavioral data indicate that serotonin (5-HT) affects dopaminergic terminal function in the striatum. OBJECTIVE: The authors propose a thorough examination of data showing controversial effects induced by striatal 5-HT on dopaminergic activity. RESULTS: Inhibitory and excitatory effects of exogenous 5-HT have been reported on DA release and synthesis, involving various striatal 5-HT receptors. 5-HT also promotes an efflux of DA through reversal of the direction of DA transport. By analogy with the mechanism of action described for amphetamine, the consequences of 5-HT entering DA terminals might explain both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of 5-HT on presynaptic DA terminal activity, but the physiological relevance of this mechanism is far from clear. The recent data suggest that the endogenous 5-HT system affects striatal DA release in a state-dependent manner associated with the conditional involvement of various 5-HT receptors such as 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), and 5-HT(4) receptors. CONCLUSION: Methodological and pharmacological issues have prevented a comprehensive overview of the influence of 5-HT on striatal DA activity.

Using a removable in vivo microdialysis probe, and remote sample collection, the temporal and dose-related behavioral and monoamine response to amphetamine (AMPH) were examined in freely-moving rats. Extracellular dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites were monitored concomitant with detailed characterization of the locomotor and stereotypy profiles. Consistent with previous results, AMPH (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) induced a rapid dose-dependent increase in dopamine concentration and decrease in the concentrations of the dopamine metabolites. Dopamine and metabolites exhibited contrasting temporal and dose-related patterns, suggesting that the decline in dopamine metabolites is functionally dissociated from the AMPH-enhanced dopamine release, and that metabolite levels do not provide an accurate index of functional dopaminergic activity. 2. Dose response comparisons revealed a significant relationship between AMPH-induced increases in behavioral perseveration and the magnitude and duration of the dopamine release. However, the temporal patterns of the neurotransmitter response and individual components of stereotypy were not parallel, suggesting that the presence of stereotypies is not associated simply with quantitative differences in striatal dopamine release. 3. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that a variety of manipulations including reserpine, apomorphine, and chronic amphetamine pretreatment, produced a dissociation between the alterations in the behavioral and dopaminergic responses to amphetamine. The behavioral response to amphetamine may be influenced by the interaction between levels of dopamine and serotonin, by the state of their respective receptors, and by the relative contributions of additional dopaminergic systems.",,England,1990,10.1016/0278-5846(90)90085-u,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2097672

In particular, Dâ‚ƒR is closely related to the etiology of schizophrenia and drug addiction. The spatial expression patterns of Dâ‚‚R and Dâ‚ƒR are distinct in certain areas of the brain. Dâ‚‚R are heavily expressed in the regions responsible for motor functions, whereas Dâ‚ƒR are more selectively expressed in the limbic regions, which are associated with cognitive and emotional functions. Therefore, disturbances in the motor and endocrine functions, which are the most serious problems caused by the current neuroleptics, are likely to result from the non-selective blockade of Dâ‚‚R. Selective regulation of Dâ‚ƒR is needed to separate the desired therapeutic activities from unwanted side effects that result from promiscuous blockade of other receptors. Dâ‚‚R and Dâ‚ƒR possess high sequence homology and employ similar signaling pathways, and it is difficult to selectively regulate them. In this review, we discuss the signaling mechanisms, intracellular trafficking, and desensitization properties of Dâ‚‚R and Dâ‚ƒR. In addition, the proteins interacting with Dâ‚‚R or Dâ‚ƒR are discussed in relation to their roles in the regulation of receptor functions, followed by the current status of the development of selective Dâ‚ƒR ligands.",,Korea (South),2010,10.1007/s12272-010-1005-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21052931

Studies of drugs that improve cognition might provide a better insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive deficits. OBJECTIVES: We compared the effects of the antipsychotic drugs aripiprazole, olanzapine, and haloperidol on performance deficit in a test of divided and sustained visual attention, the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), which provides information on attentional functioning (accuracy of visual discrimination), response control (measured by anticipatory and perseverative responses) and speed. METHODS: The cognitive deficit was induced by infusion of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist 3-(R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In vivo microdialysis was used to compare the effects of aripiprazole, olanzapine and haloperidol on CPP-induced glutamate (GLU) and serotonin (5-HT) release in the mPFC of conscious rats. RESULTS: Oral aripiprazole (1.0 and 3.0Â mg/kg) and olanzapine (0.3 and 1.0Â mg/kg), but not haloperidol (0.1Â mg/kg), abolished the CPP-induced accuracy deficit and GLU release. Haloperidol and aripiprazole, but not olanzapine, reduced perseverative over-responding, while anticipatory responding was best controlled by olanzapine. However, these effects were not associated with changes in GLU release. No association was found between the effects of these antipsychotics on CPP-induced attentional performance deficits in the 5-CSRTT and 5-HT efflux. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm that excessive GLU release in the mPFC is associated with attentional deficits. Thus, suppression of GLU release may be a target for the development of novel antipsychotic drugs with greater effect on some aspects of cognitive deficits.",,Germany,2011,10.1007/s00213-010-2065-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21052982

As it is established that responses induced by dopamine Dâ‚‚ receptor agonists are increased in models of dopaminergic sensitization, this paradigm was used in order to facilitate the detection of the partial agonist properties of aripiprazole. At variance with all other partial and full agonists tested, the partial agonist properties of aripiprazole were not revealed in guanosine 5â€²-O-(Î³-[Â³âµS]thiotriphosphate ([Â³âµS]GTPÎ³S) binding assays on striatal membranes from haloperidol-treated rats. Hence,aripiprazole behaved as an antagonist, efficiently inhibiting the functional response to dopamine. Similarly, in behavioural assays, aripiprazole dose-dependently inhibited the stereotypies elicited by apomorphine. However, at variance with haloperidol, repeated administrations of aripiprazole(3 weeks) at the doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg did not induce any up-regulation or hyperfunctionality of the dopamine Dâ‚‚ receptors in the striatum. These data highlight the putative involvement of other pharmacological targets for aripiprazole that would support in the prevention of secondary effects commonly associated with the blockade of striatal dopamine Dâ‚‚ receptors. Hence, in additional experiments, aripiprazole was found to efficiently promote [Â³âµS]GTPÎ³S binding in hippocampal membranes through the activation of 5-HT(â‚A) receptors. Further experiments investigating the second messenger cascades should be performed so as to establish the functional properties of aripiprazole and understand the mechanism underlying the prevention of dopamine receptor regulation in spite of the observed antagonism.",,Germany,2011,10.1007/s00210-010-0577-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21061116

Its significance for the pathophysiology of the disease, including its relation to neurotransmitter systems implicated in schizophrenia (like the dopamine system), remains, however, unknown. Here, we review molecular and cellular components of the dopamine system associated with postnatal neurogenesis and plasticity, both in rodents and in primates, and discuss their possible implication in schizophrenia. We focus mainly on the islands of Calleja, complex aggregations of granule cells in the ventral striatum, generated early postnatally in the subventricular zone. In contrast to the involution of the primate olfactory bulb, the islands of Calleja attain their maximal development in humans, an evolution paralleled by a larger ventral subventricular zone and more connections with other structures, including temporal cortical areas. The islands of Calleja express high levels of neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase and D3 dopamine receptors and are densely interconnected by dopaminergic projections with the ventral tegmental area. D3 receptors modulate subventricular zone neurogenesis and dopamine release. Their genetic deletion induces striatal hyperdopaminergia. We review data indicating a high plasticity of postnatal islands of Calleja, potentially facilitating susceptibility to schizophrenia-related risk factors. In this context, we propose a new pathophysiological model, where altered neurogenesis of the islands of Calleja may contribute to dysfunction of the dopamine and NO systems and psychosis through convergence of genetic and environmental disease-associated factors.",,United States,2011,10.1093/schbul/sbq134,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21097511

Flurazepam (10 microM), administered through the perfusion medium for 20 min, reduced levels of DA in dialysates from the nucleus accumbens by 60% while the same concentration of the drug had no effect on levels of DA in perfusates from the striatum. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) or with picrotoxin, a drug which blocks the GABAA receptor-associated chloride channel, inhibited the effect of flurazepam on levels of DA in the nucleus accumbens, which suggests that the effect was mediated by the multimolecular GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Administration of flurazepam had little effect on the two metabolites of DA, DOPAC and HVA, in either the nucleus accumbens or striatum. The inverse partial benzodiazepine agonist, FG 7142, had no significant action on the release of DA in the nucleus accumbens.

We have previously shown that chronic stimulation of the dopamine D2 receptor (D(2)R) with cocaine results in reduced striatal DA terminal density. The aims of this study were to establish whether this reduction in DA terminal density results in reduced striatal DA release and increased cocaine-seeking behaviour and whether D(2)R antagonism can restore the cocaine-induced alterations in DA neurotransmission and drug-seeking behaviour. Rats were housed individually and either control, cocaine, haloperidol (D(2)R antagonist), or cocaine and haloperidol was administered in the drinking water for 16 weeks. Chronic cocaine treatment, which reduced striatal DA terminal density by 20%, resulted in a reduction in basal (-34%) and cocaine-evoked (-33%) striatal DA release and increased cocaine-seeking behaviour. These cocaine-mediated effects on striatal DA terminal density, DA release and drug-seeking could be prevented by co-administration with haloperidol. Basal and cocaine-evoked DA release in the striatum directly correlated with DA terminal density and with preference for cocaine. We conclude that striatal DA terminal density and DA release is an important factor in maintaining drug preference and should be considered as a factor in drug-seeking behaviour and relapse.",,United States,2011,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2010.11.055,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21129449

We evaluated interaction between mutant human disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (mhDISC1) and maternal immune activation implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders. METHODS: Pregnant mice were treated with saline or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid at gestation day 9. Levels of inflammatory cytokines were measured in fetal and adult brains; expression of mhDISC1, endogenous DISC1, lissencephaly type 1, nuclear distribution protein nudE-like 1, glycoprotein 130, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta were assessed in cortical samples of newborn mice. Tissue content of monoamines, volumetric brain abnormalities, dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, and various domains of the mouse behavior repertoire were evaluated in adult male mice. RESULTS: Prenatal interaction produced anxiety, depression-like responses, and altered social behavior that were accompanied by decreased reactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, attenuated serotonin neurotransmission in the hippocampus, reduced enlargement of lateral ventricles, decreased volumes of amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter and density of spines on dendrites of granule cells of the hippocampus. Prenatal interaction modulated secretion of inflammatory cytokines in fetal brains, levels of mhDISC1, endogenous mouse DISC1, and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. The behavioral effects of GEI were observed only if mhDISC1 was expressed throughout the life span.

Using viral-mediated expression of an engineered G protein-coupled receptor (hM(4)D), we found that activation of hM(4)D receptors with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) potently reduced striatal neuron excitability. When hM(4)D receptors were selectively expressed in either direct or indirect pathway neurons, CNO did not change acute locomotor responses to amphetamine, but did alter behavioral plasticity associated with repeated drug treatment. Specifically, transiently disrupting striatopallidal neuronal activity facilitated behavioral sensitization, whereas decreasing excitability of striatonigral neurons impaired its persistence.

Octopamine induced a biphasic effect on the frequency and force of cardiac contractions acting as an agonist, with a strong acceleratory effect, at concentrations higher than 10(-12)M for the honeybee and higher than 50Ã—10(-9)M for the olive fruit fly. The heart of the honeybee is far more sensitive than the heart of olive fruit fly. This unusual sensitivity is extended to the blockers of octopaminergic receptors, where phentolamine at 10(-5)M stopped the spontaneous contractions of the honeybee heart completely and permanently, while the same blocker at the same concentration caused only 50% inhibition in the heart of the olive fruit fly. Phentolamine and mianserin at low concentrations of 10(-7)M also blocked the heart octopaminergic receptors, but for a short period of time, of less than 15.0 min, while a partial recovery in heart contraction started in spite of the presence of the antagonist. The unusual response of the honeybee heart in the presence of phentolamine and/or mianserin suggests excitatory effects of octopamine via two different receptor subtypes. At lower concentrations, 10(-14)M, the agonist octopamine was converted to an antagonist, inducing a hyperpolarization in the membrane potential of the honeybee cardiac pacemaker cells and inhibiting the firing rate of the heart. The inhibitory effects of octopamine on certain parameters of the rhythmic bursts of the heart of the honeybee, were similar to those of mianserin and phentolamine, typical blockers of octopaminergic receptors. The heart of the olive fruit fly was 10(5) times less sensitive to octopamine, since a persistent inhibition of heart contractions occurred at 10(-9)M. In conclusion, the acceleration of the insect heart is achieved by increasing the levels of octopamine, while there is a passive but also an active decrease in heart activity due to the minimization of octopamine.",,England,2011,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.11.022,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21147117

The association and dissociation kinetics in fCTX were rapid, and could be fitted to two-site models, suggesting [3H]KTS is labeling two cortical sites. Using the serotonin-2 (5-HT2) antagonist mianserin to determine nonspecific binding, the saturation curves revealed a single high-affinity binding site. In contrast, when unlabeled ketanserin was used for nonspecific counts, the Scatchard plots were best fitted to a two-site model but the binding parameters of the high-affinity site were similar to that obtained in the presence of mianserin.

Postmortem studies often indicate a pathologic association of increased NRG1 expression or signaling with this illness. However, the psychobehavioral implication of NRG1 signaling has mainly been investigated using hypomorphic mutant mice for individual NRG1 splice variants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To assess the behavioral impact of hyper NRG1 signaling, we generated and analyzed two independent mouse transgenic (Tg) lines carrying the transgene of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged type-1 NRG1 cDNA. The promoter of elongation-factor 1Î± gene drove ubiquitous expression of GFP-tagged NRG1 in the whole brain. As compared to control littermates, both heterozygous NRG1-Tg lines showed increased locomotor activity, a nonsignificant trend toward decreasing prepulse inhibition, and decreased context-dependent fear learning but exhibited normal levels of tone-dependent learning. In addition, social interaction scores in both Tg lines were reduced in an isolation-induced resident-intruder test. There were also phenotypic increases in a GABAergic marker (parvalbumin) as well as in myelination markers (myelin basic protein and 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase) in their frontal cortex, indicating the authenticity of NRG1 hyper-signaling, although there were marked decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase levels and dopamine content in the hippocampus.

We recently demonstrated that fluoxetine reinstates a juvenile-like form of plasticity in the adult visual system. Here we explored cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the occurrence of these plastic phenomena. Adult rats were intracortically treated with serotonin (5-HT) whereas long-term fluoxetine-treated rats were infused with the 5-HT(1A) -receptor antagonist WAY-100635, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) scavenger trkB-IgG or the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126. Plasticity was assessed as variations of visual cortex responsiveness after unilateral eyelid suture and reverse occlusion by using an electrophysiological approach. Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis were then used to explore alterations in gene expression and modifications of chromatin structure associated with the plastic outcome caused by fluoxetine in the visual system. Local infusion of 5-HT into visual cortex restored susceptibility to monocular deprivation in adulthood whereas infusion of WAY-100635, trkB-IgG or U0126 prevented the process of plasticity reactivation in fluoxetine-treated animals. Long-term fluoxetine treatment promoted a transient increase of Bdnf expression in the visual cortex, which was paralleled by an increased histone acetylation status at Bdnf promoter regions and by decreased expression of Hdac5. Accordingly, enhancing histone acetylation levels by systemic treatment with Trichostatin-A reactivated plasticity in the adult while WAY-100635-infusion prevented epigenetic modifications in Bdnf promoter areas.

These new data elucidate aspects of enzyme inhibition and pharmacokinetic interactions involving amine oxidases, cytochrome P450 enzymes, aminotransferases (transaminases), and decarboxylases (carboxy-lyases) and the effects of tyramine. Phenelzine and tranylcypromine remain widely available, and many publications have data relevant to this review. Their effect on CYP 450 enzymes is less than many newer drugs. Tranylcypromine only inhibits CYP 450 2A6 (selectively and potently). Phenelzine has no reported interactions, but, like isoniazid, weakly and irreversibly inhibits CYP 450 2C19 and 3A4 in vitro. It might possibly be implicated in interactions (as isoniazid is). Phenelzine has some clinically relevant inhibitory effects on amine oxidases, aminotransferases, and decarboxylases, and it lowers pyridoxal phosphate levels. It commonly causes pyridoxal deficiency, weight gain, sedation, and sexual dysfunction, but only rarely causes hepatic damage and failure, or neurotoxicity. The adverse effects and difficulties with monoamine oxidase inhibitors are less than previously believed or estimated, including a lower risk of hypertension, because the tyramine content in foods is now lower. Potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have a strong protective effect against tyramine-induced hypertension. The newly discovered trace amine-associated receptors probably mediate the pressor response. The therapeutic potential of tranylcypromine and L-dopa in depression and Parkinson disease is worthy of reassessment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are not used to an extent proportionate with their benefits; medical texts and doctors' knowledge require a major update to reflect the evidence of recent advances.",,United States,2011,10.1097/JCP.0b013e31820469ea,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21192146

The present study determined the effects of acute and chronic administration of mirtazapine on serotonergic transmissions in raphe nuclei and their innervation regions, frontal and entorhinal cortex, using multiple-probes microdialysis with real-time PCR and western blotting. Acute administration of mirtazapine did not affect extracellular serotonin level in raphe nuclei or cortex; however, chronic administration increased extracellular serotonin level in raphe nuclei without affecting that in cortex. Blockade of 5-HT1A receptor, but not that of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor, enhanced the effects of acute administration of mirtazapine on extracellular serotonin level in raphe nuclei. Chronic mirtazapine administration reduced the inhibitory function associated with somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor in raphe nuclei, but enhanced postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor in serotonergic innervated cortical regions. Chronic administration reduced the expression of mRNA and protein of serotonin transporter and 5-HT1A receptor in raphe nuclei, but not in the cortices. These results suggested that acute administration of mirtazapine probably activated serotonergic transmission, but its stimulatory action was abolished by activated inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor. Chronic administration of mirtazapine resulted in increased extracellular serotonin level via reduction of serotonin transporter with reduction of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor function in raphe nuclei. These pharmacological actions of mirtazapine include its serotonergic profiles as noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA).",,England,2011,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2010.12.025,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21195096

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The effects of priming injections of dopamine and 5-HT agonists on drug-seeking and effects of dopamine antagonists on methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-produced potentiation of drug-seeking following extinguished MDMA self-administration were examined. KEY RESULTS: Drug-seeking was produced by exposure to a light stimulus that had been paired with self-administered MDMA infusions and this effect was potentiated by experimenter-administered injections of the dopamine D(2) -like receptor agonist, quinpirole, the indirect agonist, amphetamine and the uptake inhibitor, GBR 12909. Drug-seeking was not elicited by the dopamine D(1) -like receptor agonist, SKF 81297 or the non-selective agonist, apomorphine. The 5-HT receptor agonists DOI or mCPP also failed to elicit drug-seeking. The 5-HT uptake inhibitor, clomipramine, attenuated drug-seeking produced by the MDMA-associated stimulus but failed to alter the potentiated response produced by GBR 12909. The D(1) receptor antagonist, SCH 23390 or the D(2) receptor antagonist, eticlopride attenuated the potentiation of drug-seeking produced by MDMA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These data provide evidence of dopaminergic mechanisms in drug-seeking following extinction of MDMA self-administration. Because tissue levels of 5-HT were significantly decreased following MDMA self-administration, we suggest that MDMA begins to preferentially activate dopaminergic substrates to potentiate the drug-seeking response.",,England,2011,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01193.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21198550

Although synthesized in pre-synaptic terminals, trace amines do not appear to act as neurotransmitters, but rather modulate responsivity to co-existing neurotransmitters. Trace amines are neither actively accumulated in synaptic vesicles, nor released in an activity-dependent manner. Further, Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1), which is selectively activated by PE and TA, is intracellular. As such, PE and TA need to cross cell membranes in order to exert their effects. This has been assumed to occur by simple diffusion, but has not previously been systematically examined. Experimental data were obtained using Fluorosome(Â®) technology. A permeability coefficient of 25.3Â Â±Â 3.8Â Ã…/s (nÂ =Â 6) was obtained for TA which was not significantly different from that obtained for the monoamine neurotransmitter noradrenaline (20.3Â Â±Â 3.8Â Ã…/s, nÂ =Â 8). PE was unsuitable for use with this system. We have also used molecular dynamics computer simulation techniques to determine the potential of mean force (PMF) associated with trace amine passage across lipid bilayers. A PMF peak barrier of 25Â Â±Â 6Â kcal/mol (protonated) and 13Â Â±Â 1Â kcal/mol (deprotonated) was obtained for PE. Protonated TA peak energy barriers were even greater at 31Â Â±Â 1Â kcal/mol. Application of a homogeneous solubility-diffusion model combining the measured permeability coefficients and simulated PMF allows fitting of the diffusion coefficient for trace amines in the hydrophobic region of the lipid bilayer. The diffusion coefficients in other regions of the membrane were found to make negligible contributions to the permeability coefficient for the calculated PMF. The fit obtained a value for the diffusion coefficient of (163Â Â±Â 25)Â Ã—Â 10(-10)Â m(2)/s for TA(+) in the hydrophobic core region. The diffusion coefficient for TA(+) in the aqueous compartment was also calculated directly by simulation yielding a value of (0.62Â Â±Â 0.26)Â Ã—Â 10(-10)Â m(2)/s. The adopted simulation methods failed to yield diffusion coefficients in the core region indicating that further work will be required to accurately predict permeability coefficients for trace amines passing through membranes.",,Austria,2011,10.1007/s00702-010-0569-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21210285

However, recent studies in this laboratory have shown that an mGluR5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine), also attenuates contextually-conditioned responding evoked by cues associated with the delivery or availability of nicotine. Thus, the results to date do not provide unequivocal evidence that the effects of mGluR5 receptor antagonists on responding for nicotine reflect a direct functional interaction between the antagonists and nicotine per se. This study employed in vivo microdialysis to test the hypothesis that the prior administration of the mGluR5 receptor antagonist, MPEP, inhibits a neural response to nicotine, increased dopamine (DA) overflow in the nucleus accumbens, implicated in directly in nicotine reinforcement. The results confirmed that prior administration of MPEP (2.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg IP) dose-dependently reduced responding for nicotine in a self-administration experiment. The higher dose caused complete inhibition of responding in a majority of the animals tested. MPEP injections, over the same dose range, also inhibited the effects of nicotine on DA overflow in the shell and core subdivisions of the rat nucleus accumbens. It is concluded that the data support the hypothesis that, in addition to their putative role in contextually-conditioned responding for nicotine, mGluR5 receptors are also implicated the primary reinforcing properties of the drug which depend upon increased DA overflow in the nucleus accumbens.",,Netherlands,2011,10.1016/j.bbr.2010.12.024,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21216262

The D2 dopamine autoreceptor (D2-AR) exerts tight regulatory control of axonal dopamine (DA) release through a mechanism suggested to involve K(+) channels. To evaluate the contribution of Kv1 voltage-gated potassium channels of the Shaker gene family to the regulation of axonal DA release by the D2-AR, the present study employed expression analyses, real time measurements of striatal DA overflow, K(+) current measurements and immunoprecipitation assays. Kv1.1, -1.2, -1.3, and -1.6 mRNA and protein were detected in midbrain DA neurons purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and in primary DA neuron cultures. In addition, Kv1.1, -1.2, and -1.6 were localized to DA axonal processes in the dorsal striatum. By means of fast scan cyclic voltammetry in striatal slice preparations, we found that the inhibition of stimulation-evoked DA overflow by a D2 agonist was attenuated by Kv1.1, -1.2, and -1.6 toxin blockers. A particular role for the Kv1.2 subunit in the process whereby axonal D2-AR inhibits DA overflow was established with the use of a selective Kv1.2 blocker and Kv1.2 knock-out mice. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of D2-AR activation to increase Kv1.2 currents in co-transfected cells and its reliance on GÎ²Î³ subunit signaling along with the physical coupling of D2-AR and Kv1.2-containing channels in striatal tissue. These findings underline the contribution of Kv1.2 in the regulation of nigrostriatal DA release by the D2-AR and thereby offer a novel mechanism by which DA release is regulated.",,United States,2011,10.1074/jbc.M110.153262,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21233214

In both humans and animals, conditioned stimuli (CSs) that signal reward availability reliably reinstate food- and drug-seeking behaviors. The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is critically involved in the cue-evoked reinstatement of food-seeking, but the role of individual neurotransmitter systems within the NAcc remains to be determined. These experiments tested the effects of intra-accumbal pharmacological manipulations of dopamine (DA) D(1) and D(2) receptors, mu-opioid receptors, or serotonin (5-HT) receptors on cue-evoked relapse to food-seeking. Rats were trained to lever press for sucrose pellets and the concurrent presentation of a light-tone CS. Once training was complete, lever-pressing was extinguished in the absence of either sucrose or CS presentation. Once each rat had reached extinction criterion, they received two reinstatement sessions in which lever pressing was renewed by response-contingent presentation of the CS. Prior to each reinstatement test, rats received NAcc microinfusions of saline or the selective D(1) receptor antagonist SCH 23390, the D(2) receptor antagonist raclopride, the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), or 5-HT hydrogen maleate.

In contrast, stimulation of serotonin (5-HT) receptors by 5-HT hydrogen maleate (5 Î¼g/0.5 Î¼L) had no effect on cue-induced reinstatement.

Metyrapone (an inhibitor of the enzyme 11-Î²-hydroxylase) has been found to be effective as an adjunctive therapy in combination with other antidepressants (ADs) in both treatment-resistant depression and animal models. To understand the mechanism of the clinical efficacy of a combination of an AD and metyrapone in treatment-resistant depression, the present study was aimed at determining the influence of fluoxetine (FLU; a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) and metyrapone, given separately or jointly, on the extracellular level of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in rat frontal cortex of freely moving rats using microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection. FLU (10 mg/kg) given alone increased the extracellular level of DA and 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex. Metyrapone (100 mg/kg) alone did not change the level of monoamines. A combination of FLU and metyrapone produced the same change in the efflux of both DA and 5-HT as did FLU alone. However, the latter combination (FLU and metyrapone) produced significantly bigger increases in the levels of extracellular DA metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid) and a 5-HT metabolite (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) than did FLU alone. The above findings suggest that--among other mechanisms--increases in the levels of extracellular DA and 5-HT metabolites may play a role in the enhancement of FLU efficacy by metyrapone, and may be of crucial importance to the pharmacotherapy of drug-resistant depression.",,Switzerland,2010,10.1016/s1734-1140(10)70363-7,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21273658

Trace amines are known to play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depression.

Further, an alteration in the levels of various neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) in the mouse brain following 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol administration was evaluated. The molecule (4-16 mg/kg., i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited the immobility period in mouse forced swim test, the effect comparable to venlafaxine. The ED50 values of 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol and venlafaxine in mouse forced swim test were found to be 5.27 [4.38-6.35] mg/kg., i.p and 4.66 [3.48-6.25] mg/kg., i.p., respectively. Further, 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol at 4-16 mg/kg., i.p. reversed the immobility period in mouse tail-suspension test. Additionally, the molecule at 8 mg/kg., i.p. reversed reserpine-induced behavioral despair in mouse forced swim test. When administered simultaneously, it (4 and 8 mg/kg., i.p) enhanced the antidepressant activity of sub-effective doses of imipramine (2mg/kg., i.p.) or fluoxetine (2mg/kg., i.p.) in the mouse forced swim test. Neurochemical analysis revealed that the molecule at 8 mg/kg., i.p. increased the levels of norepinephrine (21% increase) without affecting serotonin in the mouse brain. However, at higher dose (16 mg/kg., i.p.), it increased the levels of norepinephrine (13% increase), serotonin (37% increase), and dopamine (42% increase). The molecule enhanced the locomotor activity in mice only at higher doses. The molecule, unlike venlafaxine, which potentiated barbiturate-induced hypnosis, was devoid of any sedative activity.

Hippocampal EEG was recorded and the power in the theta frequency range was monitored in different behaviors in freely-moving rats and after brainstem stimulation in anesthetized animals. We found that in freely-moving rats, mCPP suppressed hippocampal theta rhythm and the effect was stronger during REM sleep than during waking theta states. Under urethane anesthesia, mCPP decreased the power for both spontaneous and elicited theta rhythm in a dose-dependent manner and the 5-HT2c antagonist reversed this effect.

Here, we studied the neurochemical and behavioral effects of a double 5-HT(1A/1B) receptor knockout in mice (5-HT(1A/1B)-/-) as compared to their wild-type littermates (5-HT(1A/1B)+/+). It is known that single deletion of either 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor induces behavioral changes that are not correlated with differences in brain serotonergic tone. Deletion of both receptors resulted in (i) higher emotionality of animals, as observed in three unconditioned paradigms of anxiety (open field, elevated plus maze and novelty suppressed feeding tests); (ii) a â‰ˆ200% increase in the mean spontaneous firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) compared to 5-HT(1A/1B)+/+ mice; (iii) elevated basal dialysate levels of 5-HT in the DRN and frontal cortex; (iv) an exaggerated response to acute paroxetine administration in microdialysis experiments, and (v) increased basal core body temperature. These findings suggest that the deletion of both autoreceptors induces a strong anxious-like behavioral state associated with increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Interestingly, 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice are still sensitive to the acute administration of diazepam. Moreover, while deletion of both receptors impacted on the response to acute SSRI treatment in the forced swim test, anxiolytic-like effects of a chronic SSRI treatment were still observed in 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mice. Thus, the 5-HT(1A/1B)-/- mouse model could be of great interest to unveil the mechanisms of action of the anxiolytic effects of SSRIs.",,England,2011,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.02.009,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21333660

Chronic immobilization for 7 days did not affect the shaking behavior induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) 24 h after the last restraint session.

The consequences of executive dysfunction for humans can be dramatic, as exemplified by the large range of both neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders in which such deficits negatively affect outcome and quality of life. Much evidence suggests that many clinical disorders marked by executive deficits are highly heritable and that individual differences in quantitative measures of executive function are strongly driven by genetic differences. Accordingly, intense research effort has recently been directed toward mapping the genetic architecture of executive control processes in both clinical (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) and nonclinical populations. Here we review the extant literature on the molecular genetic correlates of three exemplar but dissociable executive functions: sustained attention, response inhibition, and error processing. Our review focuses on monoaminergic gene variants given the strong body of evidence from cognitive neuroscience and pharmacology implicating dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin as neuromodulators of executive function. Associations between DNA variants of the dopamine beta hydroxylase gene and measures of sustained attention accord well with cognitive-neuroanatomical models of sustained attention. Equally, functional variants of the dopamine D2 receptor gene are reliably associated with performance monitoring, error processing, and reinforcement learning. Emerging evidence suggests that variants of the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) and dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) show promise for explaining significant variance in individual differences in both behavioral and neural measures of inhibitory control.",,United States,2011,10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.12.040,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21397212

Recently, we found that glycine improves subjective sleep quality in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of oral glycine administration on endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of living rats. METHODS: Microdialysis probes were inserted stereotaxically into the rat prefrontal cortex. Cortical levels of 5-HT and dopamine were measured following oral administration of 1 or 2 g/kg glycine, 2 g/kg d-serine, or 2 g/kg L-serine. RESULTS: Both glycine and d-serine significantly increased extracellular 5-HT levels for 10 min, whereas dopamine levels remained unchanged. L-serine, in contrast, had no significant effects on 5-HT levels. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the increase in 5-HT in response to glycine and d-serine was mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The transient increase in 5-HT in the PFC might be associated with the alleviation of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and the amelioration of sleep quality in patients with insomnia.",,Australia,2011,10.1111/j.1440-1819.2010.02181.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21414089

Given the similar attenuation of SERT activity in SERT+/- mice and in humans with short allele(s) of SERT in its promoter region, it is conceivable that SERT+/- mice offer an adequate model to mimic the human subpopulation with respect to their altered response to SSRIs. This study investigated the effects of the most selective SSRI escitalopram, in heterozygous SERT+/- mice using a combined electrophysiological and neurochemical approach. Results indicated that administration of escitalopram for 2 d resulted in a 72% and 63% decrease in dorsal raphe 5-HT neuronal firing rate in SERT+/+ and SERT+/- mice, respectively. In contrast, administration of escitalopram for 21 d produced a gradual recovery of 5-HT neuronal firing rate to basal level in SERT+/+, but not in SERT+/- mice. In the hippocampus, microdialysis revealed that sustained administration of escitalopram produced a greater increase in extracellular 5-HT ([5-HT]ext) outflow in SERT+/- than in the wild-types with or without a washout of the SSRI. Nevertheless, the ability of microiontophoretically applied 5-HT to inhibit the firing rate of CA3 pyramidal neurons was not different between SERT+/+ and SERT+/- mice given escitalopram for 21 d. The data indicate that the poor response to SSRIs of depressive patients with short allele(s) of SERT is not attributable to a lesser increase in 5-HT transmission in the hippocampus.",,England,2012,10.1017/S1461145711000484,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21439106

Pharmacological and gene knockout studies have revealed a critical role for 5-HT in numerous processes, including cell division, neuronal migration, differentiation and synaptogenesis. An excess in brain 5-HT appears to be mechanistically linked to abnormal brain development, which in turn is associated with neurological disorders. Ambient levels of 5-HT are controlled by a vast orchestra of proteins, including a multiplicity of pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT receptors, heteroreceptors, enzymes and transporters. The 5-HT transporter (SERT, 5-HTT) is arguably the most powerful regulator of ambient extracellular 5-HT. SERT is the high-affinity uptake mechanism for 5-HT and exerts tight control over the strength and duration of serotonergic neurotransmission. Perturbation of its expression level or function has been implicated in many diseases, prominent among them are psychiatric disorders. This review synthesizes existing information on the ontogeny of SERT during embryonic and early postnatal development though adolescence, along with factors that influence its expression and function during these critical developmental windows. We integrate this knowledge to emphasize how inappropriate SERT expression or its dysregulation may be linked to the pathophysiology of psychiatric, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases.",,England,2011,10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.03.013,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21447358

Dysbindin protein is abundantly expressed in synaptic regions of the hippocampus, including the terminal field of the mossy fibers, and this hippocampal expression of dysbindin is strongly reduced in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, we examined the functional role of dysbindin in hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synaptic transmission and its modulation using the sandy mouse, a spontaneous mutant with deletion in the dysbindin gene. Electrophysiological recordings were made in hippocampal slices prepared from adult male sandy mice and their wild-type littermates. Basic properties of the mossy fiber synaptic transmission in the mutant mice were generally normal except for slightly reduced frequency facilitation. Serotonin and dopamine, two major neuromodulators implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, can potentiate mossy fiber synaptic transmission probably via an increase in cAMP levels. Synaptic potentiation induced by serotonin and dopamine was very variable in magnitude in the mutant mice, with some mice showing prominent enhancement as compared with the wild-type mice. In addition, the magnitude of potentiation induced by these monoamines significantly correlated with each other in the mutant mice, indicating that a subpopulation of sandy mice has marked hypersensitivity to both serotonin and dopamine. While direct activation of the cAMP cascade by forskolin induced robust synaptic potentiation in both wild-type and mutant mice, this forskolin-induced potentaition correlated in magnitude with the serotonin-induced potentiation only in the mutant mice, suggesting a possible change in coupling of receptor activation to downstream signaling. These results suggest that the dysbindin deficiency could be an essential genetic factor that causes synaptic hypersensitivity to dopamine and serotonin. The altered monoaminergic modulation at the mossy fiber synapse could be a candidate pathophysiological basis for impairment of hippocampus-dependent brain functions in schizophrenia.",,United States,2011,10.1371/journal.pone.0018113,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21448290

To study the role of Î±1,6-fucosylation in brain tissue where Fut8 is highly expressed, we examined Fut8(-/-) mice using a combination of neurological and behavioral tests. Fut8(-/-) mice exhibited multiple behavioral abnormalities consistent with a schizophrenia-like phenotype. Fut8(-/-) mice displayed increased locomotion compared with wild-type (Fut8(+/+)) and heterozygous (Fut8(+/-)) mice. In particular, Fut8(-/-) mice showed strenuous hopping behavior in a novel environment. Working memory performance was impaired in Fut8(-/-) mice as evidenced by the Y-maze tests. Furthermore, Fut8(-/-) mice showed prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficiency. Intriguingly, although there was no significant difference between Fut8(+/+) and Fut8(+/-) mice in the PPI test under normal conditions, Fut8(+/-) mice showed impaired PPI after exposure to a restraint stress. This result suggests that reduced expression of Fut8 is a plausible cause of schizophrenia and related disorders. The levels of serotonin metabolites were significantly decreased in both the striatum and nucleus accumbens of the Fut8(-/-) mice. Likewise, treatment with haloperidol, which is an antipsychotic drug that antagonizes dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors, significantly reduced hopping behaviors.

In this study, the action of several tryptophan metabolites, yielded by the kynurenine pathway, on cortical cholinergic toxicity was evaluated following focal injection into the rat nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nbM). Metabolites were injected singly or in combination with a fixed dose of quinolinic acid (QUIN). Cholinergic toxicity, or protection against it, was evaluated by measurements of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity or potassium-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine [( 3H]ACh) from slices of the frontoparietal cortex, from the injected and uninjected sides. Focal injections of QUIN and 3-hydroxyanthranilic, but not kynurenic, picolinic, quinaldic or anthranilic acid, produced a dose-related decrease in ChAT activity, with QUIN being more potent. Kynurenic, picolinic, quinaldic and anthranilic acid, co-injected into the nbM with QUIN (120 nmol), produced dose-related antagonism of the neurotoxicity associated with QUIN alone. Picolinic acid also prevented the reduction in cortical [3H]ACh release induced by injections of QUIN. Kynurenic and picolinic acid produced a complete blockade of QUIN's effect on cortical ChAT activity, while quinaldic and anthranilic acid produced a partial blockade. The order of effectiveness against QUIN was kynurenic greater than picolinic greater than quinalidic or anthranilic acid. Evaluation of thin sections following Cresyl violet staining indicated that injections of QUIN produced neuronal loss and glial proliferation, while co-injections of picolinic or quinaldic acid with QUIN protected neurons.

There were only small decreases (-5.4%) in D1 receptor binding in the dorsolateral aspect of the CPu in the SHR, whereas there were no changes in striatal D1 receptors in the SD rats.

Blockade of the NMDA receptor with the non-competitive antagonist, MK801, prevented increases in striatal and nigral levels of NT following both single and multiple administrations of methamphetamine. Significant attenuation of the methamphetamine-induced changes in the striatal NT system were observed with MK801 doses as low as 0.01 mg/kg per dose. In contrast, administration of NMDA caused significant increases in both striatal and nigral NT. The NMDA-induced increase in striatal NT content, like that caused by methamphetamine, was blocked by MK801. The NT system associated with the nucleus accumbens responded in a similar manner in that MK801 (0.1 mg/kg per dose) totally blocked the methamphetamine-induced increases and NMDA administration elevated the NT levels in this structure. Since the methamphetamine-related changes in NT content have been previously shown to be due to increased activity at dopamine D1 receptors, these results strongly suggest that NMDA receptors play an important role in mediating the dopamine D1 regulation of neurotensin systems.

Current and voltage recordings were made from antidromically identified motoneurones (MNs) in transverse thoracolumbar spinal cord slices of neonatal rats. 2. Applied by superfusion (10-100 microM) or pressure ejection, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) elicited a slow depolarization (or inward current) in 81% and a hyperpolarization (or outward current) in 9% of responsive MNs; the responses persisted in a low-Ca2+, high-Mg2+ or tetrodotoxin (TTX)-containing solution. 3. 5-HT induced the occurrence in some MNs of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), which were reversibly eliminated by TTX, low-Ca2+, high-Mg2+ solution or by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ketanserin and spiperone. Also, kynurenic acid and strychnine abolished, respectively, the 5-HT-induced EPSPs and IPSPs. 4. The 5-HT depolarization was associated with increased membrane resistance, was reduced by hyperpolarization and nullified near -100 mV. The extrapolated reversal potential was shifted to a positive direction in elevated [K+]o. 5. The depolarizing response was mimicked by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist (+2-)-1(2,5-dimethyoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI) and blocked by 5-HT antagonists methysergide and cyproheptadine and by 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and spiperone; methiothepin and MDL 72222 were without effect. 6.

The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) mimicked the hyperpolarizing response. 7. Single or repetitive (10-30 Hz) electrical stimuli elicited in about 30% of MNs, in addition to a fast EPSP, a slow EPSP with electrophysiological characteristics similar to that of 5-HT induced depolarization. Methysergide and spiperone abolished the slow EPSPs evoked in some of these MNs. 8. It is suggested that 5-HT, acting on 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors, depolarizes and hyperpolarizes the MNs by decreasing and increasing K+ conductance. Additionally, 5-HT activates, via 5-HT2 receptors, excitatory and inhibitory interneurones, thereby indirectly affecting the activity of MNs.

Currently, there is a lack of adequate treatment for the cognitive symptoms associated with these diseases. Cholinergic signaling and, in particular, M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m1AChR) signaling have been implicated in the regulation of multiple cognitive domains. Thus, the M1AChR has been identified as a therapeutic drug target for diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, that exhibit marked cognitive dysfunction as part of their clinical manifestation. Unfortunately, the development of selective M1 agonist medications has not been successful, mostly because of the highly conserved orthosteric acetylcholine binding site among the five muscarinic receptor subtypes. More recent efforts have focused on the development of allosteric M1AChR modulators that target regions of the receptor distinct from the orthosteric site that are less conserved between family members. However, orthosteric and allosteric ligands may differentially modulate receptor function and ultimately downstream signaling pathways. Thus, the need for highly selective M1AChR orthosteric agonists still exists, not only as a potential therapeutic but also as a pharmacological tool to better understand the physiologic consequences of M1AChR orthosteric activation.

Under nonequilibrium conditions, the polyamines enhanced [3H]TCP binding approximately 9-fold, with EC50 values ranging from 0.8 to 60 microM. The order of potency in enhancing [3H]TCP binding was N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-propanediamine greater than N,N'-bis-(3-aminopropyl)-ethylenediamine greater than spermine greater than spermidine greater than N,N'-bis-(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine. 1,3-Diaminopropane produced a partial agonistic effect, whereas putrescine, cadaverine, and 1,7-diaminoheptane were without effect at concentrations up to 1 mM. Eadie-Hofstee analysis of spermidine-induced [3H]TCP binding at equilibrium revealed a 3-fold increase in the affinity without a significant change in receptor density. This was further supported by kinetic data that showed that spermidine produced an increase in the association rate and a decrease in the dissociation rate of [3H]TCP binding to its site. Putrescine, cadaverine, and 1,3-diaminopropane antagonized the effects of spermidine by an apparently noncompetitive mechanism.

The histaminergic neurons originate from the tuberomamillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus and send projections to most parts of the brain. The central histamine system is involved in many brain functions such as arousal, control of pituitary hormone secretion, suppression ofeating and cognitive functions. The effects of neuronal histamine are mediated via G-protein-coupled H1-H4 receptors. The prominent role of histamine as a wake-promoting substance has drawn interest to treat sleep-wake disorders, especially narcolepsy, via modulation of H3 receptor function. Post mortem studies have revealed alterations in histaminergic system in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Brain histamine levels are decreased in Alzheimer's disease patients whereas abnormally high histamine concentrations are found in the brains of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenic patients. Low histamine levels are associated with convulsions and seizures. The release of histamine is altered in response to different types of brain injury: e.g. increased release of histamine in an ischemic brain trauma might have a role in the recovery from neuronal damage. Neuronal histamine is also involved in the pain perception. Drugs that increase brain and spinal histamine concentrations have antinociceptive properties. Histaminergic drugs, most importantly histamine H3 receptors ligands, have shown efficacy in many animal models of the above-mentioned disorders. Ongoing clinical trials will reveal the efficacy and safety of these drugs in the treatment of human patients.",,United States,2010,10.1007/978-1-4419-8056-4_10,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21618891

However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are largely unknown. It has previously been shown in mice that stimulation of the dentate nucleus (DN) of the cerebellum evokes dopamine (DA) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, we investigated the neuronal circuitry by which the cerebellum modulates mPFC DA release. Fixed potential amperometry was used to determine the contribution of two candidate pathways by which the cerebellum may modulate mPFC DA release. In urethane anesthetized mice, DA release evoked by DN stimulation (50 Hz) was recorded in mPFC following local anesthetic lidocaine (0.02 Î¼g) or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenate (0.5 Î¼g) infusions into the mediodorsal or ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (ThN md; ThN vl), or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Following intra-VTA lidocaine or kynurenate infusions, DA release was decreased by âˆ¼50%. Following intra-ThN md and ThN vl infusions of either drug, DA release was decreased by âˆ¼35% and 15%, respectively. Reductions in DA release following lidocaine or kynurenate infusions were not significantly different indicating that neuronal cells in the VTA and ThN were activated primarily if not entirely by glutamatergic inputs. The present study suggests that neuropathological changes in the cerebellum commonly observed in autism, schizophrenia, and other cognitive disorders could result in a loss of functionality of cerebellar-mPFC circuitry that is manifested as aberrant dopaminergic activity in the mPFC. Additionally, these results specifically implicate glutamate as a modulator of mPFC dopaminergic activity.",,United States,2011,10.1002/syn.20960,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21638338

Relative to the other AAPs, both olanzapine and clozapine exhibit a particularly high antagonistic affinity for histamine and muscarinic receptors which have been hypothesized as mediators of the reported increase in weight and glucose abnormalities. In this article, we review the current evidence for the AAP associated weight gain and abnormal glucose metabolism. We postulate that the effects of the AAPs on food intake and peripheral metabolism are initially independently regulated but with increasing body adiposity, the early AAP-induced impairments in peripheral metabolism will be exacerbated, thereby establishing a vicious cycle such that the effects of the AAP are magnified by the known pathophysiological consequences of obesity.

Odors from carnivores elicit stereotyped fear and avoidance responses in rodents, although sensory mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here, we identified a chemical produced by predators that activates a mouse olfactory receptor and produces an innate behavioral response. We purified this predator cue from bobcat urine and identified it to be a biogenic amine, 2-phenylethylamine. Quantitative HPLC analysis across 38 mammalian species indicates enriched 2-phenylethylamine production by numerous carnivores, with some producing >3,000-fold more than herbivores examined. Calcium imaging of neuronal responses in mouse olfactory tissue slices identified dispersed carnivore odor-selective sensory neurons that also responded to 2-phenylethylamine. Two prey species, rat and mouse, avoid a 2-phenylethylamine odor source, and loss-of-function studies involving enzymatic depletion of 2-phenylethylamine from a carnivore odor indicate it to be required for full avoidance behavior. Thus, rodent olfactory sensory neurons and chemosensory receptors have the capacity for recognizing interspecies odors. One such cue, carnivore-derived 2-phenylethylamine, is a key component of a predator odor blend that triggers hard-wired aversion circuits in the rodent brain.

Glycine was able to overcome this effect and in the presence of 5,7-DCKA enhanced [3H]TCP binding to antagonist-free levels. 5,7-DCKA completely and noncompetitively antagonized several NMDA receptor-mediated biochemical and electrophysiological responses. Thus, micromolar concentrations of 5,7-DCKA inhibited NMDA-stimulated elevation of cytosolic calcium in cultured hippocampal neurons, cGMP accumulation in cerebellar slices, and norepinephrine release from hippocampal slices. The glycine antagonist could also block the action of synaptically released agonist, as shown by its ability to inhibit the increase in the magnitude of the population spike that follows tetanic stimulation of the hippocampus in vitro (long term potentiation). Inclusion of glycine or D-serine prevented all these effects of the antagonist. 5,7-DCKA was a potent anticonvulsant when administered intracerebroventricularly to mice. As in the in vitro experiments, the dose-response curve for the antagonist was shifted rightward in a parallel fashion when D-serine was coinjected.

One is an increase of D2 receptors (D2Rs) in the striatum and another is a decrease in the GABAergic function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whether these two defects are functionally linked is not known. We previously reported that selective overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum of the mouse causes behavioral abnormality associated with PFC functions. Using patch-clamp recording, we find that overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum affects inhibitory transmission in the PFC and dopamine (DA) sensitivity. The overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum caused an increase in frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer V pyramidal neurons, whereas their neuronal excitability was unaffected. In contrast, both the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) were significantly decreased in these mice, indicating a reduced inhibitory transmission. Furthermore, in D2R transgenic mice the dopaminergic modulation of evoked IPSCs was shifted, with reduced sensitivity. The change in dopamine sensitivity in the PFC of D2R transgenic mice appears specific for D2Rs because in D2R transgenic mice the effects of D2 agonist but not D1 agonist, on both evoked IPSCs and EPSCs, were reduced. Together, these results indicate that overexpression of D2Rs in the striatum leads to a functional deficit in the GABAergic system. These results provide a functional link between D2R overexpression and GABAergic inhibition in the PFC and suggest that the postulated deficit in GABAergic function in schizophrenia could be secondary to alterations in the striatal dopamine system.",,United States,2011,10.1073/pnas.1109718108,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21730148

We also evaluated whether activation of BLA 5-HT2CRs accounts for the anxiogenic effect caused by acute systemic administration of the antidepressants imipramine and fluoxetine.

Expression of these genes in the brainstem containing 5-HT neurons may also be related to vulnerability or resilience to stress-related psychopathology. Here we investigated 5-HT markers and expression of genes for Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and apoptotic proteins in the brainstem in relation to swim stress-induced behavioral despair. We found that anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL gene is sensitive to stress during the course of fluoxetine administration. Responsiveness of this gene to stress appeared concomitantly with an antidepressant-like effect of fluoxetine in the forced swim test. Bcl-xL transcript levels showed negative correlations with duration of immobility in the test and 5-HT turnover in the brainstem. In contrast, BDNF and pro-apoptotic protein Bax mRNA levels were unchanged by either fluoxetine or stress, suggesting specificity of Bcl-xL gene responses to these treatments. We also found that the levels of mRNAs for tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) were significantly down-regulated following prolonged treatment with fluoxetine, but were not affected by stress. Unlike TPH2 and 5-HTT, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels were not altered by fluoxetine but significantly increased in response to swim stress.

In vitro data have indicated NPY as an important mediator in the regulation of different diseases e.g. related to obesity, anxiety, depression, pain, memory loss and sleep disorders. In particular, studies of NPY levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of depressed patients have shown a significant reduction of NPY levels when compared to control subjects. In addition, decreased concentrations of NPY were measured in the brain of suicide victims. These studies suggest that a reduction in cerebral NPY function may be associated with depressive symptoms. In the present work, a putative interaction between NPY, the catecholaminergic and serotonergic systems has been analysed by means of in vivo Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) with treated carbon fibre micro electrodes (mCFE). It appeared that DPV with mCFE is an efficacious tool to monitor in vivo basal levels of catechols (Peak 2) and indoles (Peak 3) in discrete brain regions of rodents. Furthermore, it is shown that the peptidergic signal (Peak 5) simultaneously recorded with Peaks 2 and 3 in the amygdala could correspond to the oxidation of basal endogenous NPY. In addition, pharmacological treatments performed in vivo with exogenous NPY and with Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 have indicated that these compounds interact positively with endogenous catecholaminergic and serotoninergic systems, in a way similar to that of the antidepressants imipramine and fluoxetine. In addition, the observed decrease of endogenous Peak 5 after treatment with imipramine or fluoxetine could be related to the concomitant stimulation of the catecholaminergic system with consequent reduced need for endogenous NPY. This would imply that NPY could be one of the endogenous chemicals acting on the maintenance of the mood. Thus, an antidepressant therapeutic potential of NPY and related compounds (e.g. BIBP3226) could be proposed.",,Netherlands,2011,10.1016/j.brainres.2011.05.033,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21777907

Such a relationship is not sustained in simple form through to the indoleamine hallucinogens and the indole based Vinca alkaloids. However, LSD and the more potent hallucinogens retain the full potential to disrupt the structure of the brain's cytoskeleton indirectly via serotonin and the raphe system. Serotonin appears to have a direct role in regulating and maintaining microtubules and microfilaments. It appears that a second receptor mediated action is required for full hallucinogenic activity.

LY2140023 monohydrate is the methionine prodrug of the selective mGlu(2/3) receptor agonist LY404039 and is currently being assessed for the treatment of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the central pharmacological activity of LY2140023 monohydrate in preclinical and clinical studies. METHODS: Effects on neurotransmitter/metabolite concentrations were assessed in male rats following single oral doses of LY2140023 monohydrate (microdiasylates from the prefrontal cortex), single intraperitoneal injection of LY404039 [cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)], or LY2140023 monohydrate dosed once daily for 7 days (CSF). A clinical study in 16 healthy subjects assessed the effects of LY2140023 monohydrate 40 mg orally twice daily for 14 days in lumbar CSF. RESULTS: Rat studies: Acute dosing with LY2140023 monohydrate resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in extracellular concentrations of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), but not 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), in the prefrontal cortex. LY2140023 monohydrate dosing for 7 days elevated the concentrations of HVA in CSF, while acutely dosed LY404039 increased the concentrations of DOPAC, HVA, and methoxy-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), but not 5-HIAA. Clinical study: Significant increases were seen for DOPAC, HVA, 5-HIAA, and MHPG in the CSF of subjects receiving LY2140023 monohydrate, but not placebo. CONCLUSIONS: LY2140023 monohydrate and/or LY404039 dosing potently affected dopamine turnover and also significantly affected serotonin turnover in the human and rat central nervous systems.

One therapeutic strategy has been to reduce AÎ² levels to limit its accumulation. Activation of certain neurotransmitter receptors can regulate AÎ² metabolism. We assessed the ability of serotonin signaling to alter brain AÎ² levels and plaques in a mouse model of AD and in humans. In mice, brain interstitial fluid (ISF) AÎ² levels were decreased by 25% following administration of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs. Similarly, direct infusion of serotonin into the hippocampus reduced ISF AÎ² levels. Serotonin-dependent reductions in AÎ² were reversed if mice were pretreated with inhibitors of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Chronic treatment with an SSRI, citalopram, caused a 50% reduction in brain plaque load in mice. To test whether serotonin signaling could impact AÎ² plaques in humans, we retrospectively compared brain amyloid load in cognitively normal elderly participants who were exposed to antidepressant drugs within the past 5 y to participants who were not. Antidepressant-treated participants had significantly less amyloid load as quantified by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB).

Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been reported to have measurable, if incomplete, effects on cognitive dysfunction in this model, and these effects may be due to their ability to normalize a subset of the physiological deficits occurring within the prefrontal cortex. Asenapine is an atypical antipsychotic approved in the US for the treatment of schizophrenia and for the treatment, as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproate, of acute manic or mixed episodes associated bipolar I disorder. To understand its cognitive and neurochemical actions more fully, we explored the effects of short- and long-term dosing with asenapine on measures of cognitive and motor function in normal monkeys and in those previously exposed for 2 weeks to PCP; we further studied the impact of treatment with asenapine on dopamine and serotonin turnover in discrete brain regions from the same cohort. METHODS: Monkeys were trained to perform reversal learning and object retrieval procedures before twice daily administration of PCP (0.3 mg/kg intra-muscular) or saline for 14 days. Tests confirmed cognitive deficits in PCP-exposed animals before beginning twice daily administration of saline (control) or asenapine (50, 100, or 150 Î¼g/kg, intra-muscular). Dopamine and serotonin turnover were assessed in 15 specific brain regions by high-pressure liquid chromatography measures of the ratio of parent amine to its major metabolite. RESULTS: On average, PCP-treated monkeys made twice as many errors in the reversal task as did control monkeys. Asenapine facilitated reversal learning performance in PCP-exposed monkeys, with improvements at trend level after 1 week of administration and reaching significance after 2-4 weeks of dosing. In week 4, the improvement with asenapine 150 Î¼g/kg (p = 0.01) rendered the performance of PCP-exposed monkeys indistinguishable from that of normal monkeys without compromising fine motor function. Asenapine administration (150 Î¼g/kg twice daily) produced an increase in dopamine and serotonin turnover in most brain regions of control monkeys and asenapine (50-150 Î¼g/kg) increased dopamine and serotonin turnover in several brain regions of subchronic PCP-treated monkeys. No significant changes in the steady-state levels of dopamine or serotonin were observed in any brain region except for the central amygdala, in which a significant depletion of dopamine was observed in PCP-treated control monkeys; asenapine treatment reversed this dopamine depletion. A significant decrease in serotonin utilization was observed in the orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens in PCP monkeys, which may underlie poor reversal learning. In the same brain regions, dopamine utilization was not affected. Asenapine ameliorated this serotonin deficit in a dose-related manner that matched its efficacy for reversing the cognitive deficit. CONCLUSIONS: In this model of cognitive dysfunction, asenapine produced substantial gains in executive functions that were maintained with long-term administration. The cognition-enhancing effects of asenapine and the neurochemical changes in serotonin and dopamine turnover seen in this study are hypothesized to be primarily related to its potent serotonergic and noradrenergic receptor binding properties, and support the potential for asenapine to reduce cognitive dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",,England,2012,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.08.026,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21875607

Dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in striatum, hypothalamus, frontal cortex, and anterior limbic cortex declined by about 50% as rabbits aged from less than 1 to 5 years of age. Similar decreases were found for histamine-stimulated activity in hypothalamus and the cortical regions. These changes were in maximal response rather than in affinity for amine. In contrast, dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase of retina and both basal and Gpp(NH)p-stimulated activity in these regions were not altered with age. In addition, with age the number of binding sites for [3H]spiroperidol, a dopamine antagonist, decreased by 30--40% without change in ligand affinity in striatum and limbic cortex. These changes in striatum and cortex occurred in the absence of decreases in either dopamine concentration or choline acetylase activity. It is proposed that selective age-dependent decreases in the functional number of biogenic amine receptors occur in the absence of, or independent from neuronal cell loss, possibly by a mechanism of desensitization.

LID comprises two major components, the priming process responsible for its onset and the expression of involuntary movements that underlies its clinical manifestation. The mechanisms responsible for these components are partially understood and their biochemical basis is being unraveled but avoidance and treatment remain an issue. In this chapter, we review what is known about the involvement of dopaminergic systems in LID and the way in which dopaminergic therapy can be used to avoid the onset of LID or to reverse or suppress involuntary movements once these have been established. The involvement of specific dopamine receptor subtypes, continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) and continuous drug delivery (CDD) is reviewed. However, a major role is emerging in the avoidance and suppression of LID through the use of nondopaminergic mechanisms and we consider the present and future use of glutamatergic drugs, serotoninergic agents, adenosine antagonists and others as a means of improving therapy. There is compelling basic science supporting a role for nondopaminergic approaches to LID but at the moment the translational benefit to PD is not being achieved as predicted. There needs to be further consideration of why this is the case and how in future, both experimental models of dyskinesia and clinical trial design can be optimized to ensure success.",,United States,2011,10.1016/B978-0-12-381328-2.00005-5,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21907085

Lung cellular and molecular physiology,,"Maternal use of selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), but little is known about 5-HT signaling in the developing lung. We hypothesize that 5-HT plays a key role in maintaining high pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the fetus and that fetal exposure to SSRIs increases 5-HT activity and causes pulmonary hypertension. We studied the hemodynamic effects of 5-HT, 5-HT receptor antagonists, and SSRIs in chronically prepared fetal sheep. Brief infusions of 5-HT (3-20 Î¼g) increased PVR in a dose-related fashion. Ketanserin, a 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist, caused pulmonary vasodilation and inhibited 5-HT-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction. In contrast, intrapulmonary infusions of GR127945 and SB206553, 5-HT 1B and 5-HT 2B receptor antagonists, respectively, had no effect on basal PVR or 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction. Pretreatment with fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, blunted the effects of 5-HT infusion. Brief infusions of the SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, caused potent and sustained elevations of PVR, which was sustained for over 60 min after the infusion. SSRI-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction was reversed by infusion of ketanserin and did not affect the acute vasodilator effects of acetylcholine. We conclude that 5-HT causes pulmonary vasoconstriction, contributes to maintenance of high PVR in the normal fetus through stimulation of 5-HT 2A receptors and Rho kinase activation, and mediates the hypertensive effects of SSRIs. We speculate that prolonged exposure to SSRIs can induce PPHN through direct effects on the fetal pulmonary circulation.",,United States,2011,10.1152/ajplung.00198.2011,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21908589

Enhancing brain serotonin has been found to regulate glycogen synthase Kinase-3 (GSK3), but the signaling mechanism and functional significance of this regulation remain to be determined. In this study, we tested the signaling mechanism mediating 5-HT1A receptor-regulated GSK3 in the hippocampus. Using mutant GSK3 knock-in mice, we also tested the role of GSK3 in the behavioral effects of 5-HT1A receptors and the serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. The results showed that activation of 5-HT1A receptors by 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) increased phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine of both GSK3Î± and GSK3Î² in several areas of the hippocampus. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was accompanied by an increase in the active phosphorylation of Akt, and was blocked by LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). Phosphorylation of GSK3Î², but not GSK3Î±, was necessary for 5-HT1A receptors to suppress the hippocampus-associated contextual fear learning. Furthermore, acute fluoxetine treatment up-regulated both phospho-Ser21-GSK3Î± and phospho-Ser9-GSK3Î² in the hippocampus. Blocking phosphorylation of GSK3Î± and GSK3Î² diminished the anti-immobility effect of fluoxetine treatment in the forced swim test, wherein the effect of GSK3Î² was more prominent. These results together suggest that PI3K/Akt is a signaling mechanism mediating the GSK3-regulating effect of 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus, and regulation of GSK3 is an important intermediate signaling process in the behavioral functions of 5-HT1A receptors and fluoxetine.",,England,2012,10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.09.009,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21946431

Pre-perfusion with sub-therapeutic concentration LTG inhibited CRF1-induced serotonin reduction without affecting CRF2-induced serotonin release, whereas pre-perfusion with therapeutic concentration of LTG inhibited both CRF1- and CRF2-actions. In contrast, both therapeutic and supratherapeutic concentrations of CBZ inhibited CRF2-induced serotonin release without affecting CRF1-induced serotonin reduction. Neither LTG nor CBZ affected the CRF-induced cAMP production in cells over-expressing CRF1 and CRF2 receptors. This study demonstrated that inhibition of CRF2-receptor-mediated serotonergic transmission is a mechanism shared by LTG and CBZ, two clinically related compounds, whereas LTG but not CBZ inhibits CRF1-receptor-mediated serotonergic transmission. Therefore, these mechanisms may contribute to the clinical actions of these agents.",,Germany,2012,10.1007/s00213-011-2506-y,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21947356

Tryptamine interacts with trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) and because of its structural similarity to 5-HT, it may also interact with 5-HT receptors. Our hypothesis is therefore that the rat mesenteric arterial bed will exhibit vasopressor and vasodepressor responses to tryptamine via both 5-HT and TAARs. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Tryptamine-evoked responses were assayed from pressure changes of the rat-isolated mesenteric vasculature perfused at constant flow rate in the absence and presence of adrenoceptor and 5-HT receptor antagonists. KEY RESULTS: Tryptamine caused dose-dependent vasoconstriction of the mesenteric arterial bed as increases in perfusion pressure. These were unaffected by the Î±(1) -adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, but were attenuated by the non-selective Î±-adrenoceptor antagonist, phentolamine. The 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists, ketanserin and ritanserin, abolished the tryptamine-induced pressure increases to reveal vasodilator responses in mesenteric beds preconstricted with phenylephrine. These tryptamine-induced vasodilator responses were unaffected by the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, SB269970, but were eliminated by the NOS inhibitor, N(Ï‰) -nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Tyramine and Î²-phenylethylamine also caused vasodilatation in pre-constricted vasculature, which was also abolished by L-NAME. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Tryptamine causes vasoconstriction of the mesenteric vasculature via 5-HT(2A) receptors, which when inhibited exposed vasorelaxant effects in pre-constricted tissues. The vasodilatation was independent of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(7) receptors but like that for tyramine and Î²-phenylethylamine was due to NO release. Potency orders suggest TAAR involvement in the vasodilatation by these trace amines.",,England,2012,10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01706.x,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-21958009

We utilized the honey bee model and a newly developed spatial avoidance conditioning assay to probe effects of biogenic amines octopamine (OA) and dopamine (DA) on avoidance learning. In this new protocol non-harnessed bees associate a spatial color cue with mild electric shock punishment. After a number of experiences with color and shock the bees no longer enter the compartment associated with punishment. Intrinsic aspects of avoidance conditioning are associated with natural behavior of bees such as punishment (lack of food, explosive pollination mechanisms, danger of predation, heat, etc.) and their association to floral traits or other spatial cues during foraging. The results show that DA reduces the punishment received whereas octopamine OA increases the punishment received. These effects are dose-dependent and specific to the acquisition phase of training. The effects during acquisition are specific as shown in experiments using the antagonists Pimozide and Mianserin for DA and OA receptors, respectively.

The underlying neuroadaptations can include marked alterations in signaling via dopamine (DA) receptors (DRs) and metabotropic glutamate (Glu) receptors (mGluRs). Previously, we reported that DR antagonists blocked forms of synaptic plasticity in amygdala slices of Sprague-Dawley rats withdrawn from repeated cocaine administration. In the present study, we investigated synaptic plasticity induced by exogenous DA and its dependence on mGluR signaling and a potential role for phospholipase D (PLD) as a downstream element linked to mGluR and DR signaling. Utilizing a modified conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm as a functional behavioral measure, we studied the neurophysiological effects after two-weeks to the last cocaine conditioning. We recorded, electrophysiologically, a DR-induced synaptic potentiation in the basolateral to lateral capsula central amygdala (BLA-lcCeA) synaptic pathway that was blocked by antagonists of group I mGluRs, particularly, the PLD-linked mGluR. In addition, we observed 2-2.5 fold increase in PLD expression and 3.7-fold increase in basal PLD enzyme activity. The enhanced PLD activity could be further stimulated (9.3 fold) by a DA D1-like (D1/5R) receptor agonist, and decreased to control levels by mGluR1 and PLD-linked mGluR antagonists. Diminished CPP was observed by infusion of a PLD-linked mGluR antagonist, PCCG-13, in the amygdala 15 minutes prior to testing, two weeks after the last cocaine injection.

The MAO-A system was clearly altered in the PS-1(M146V) mouse as revealed by (a) a mismatch between MAO-A protein expression and MAO-A activity; (b) changes in MAO-A-mediated monoaminergic neurotransmitter metabolism; (c) changes in non-cognitive behavior following treatment with the irreversible MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline; and (d) an increase in the potency of clorgyline in these same mice.

Besides the established pleiotropic regulatory functions in the periphery, the interest in the potential homeostatic role of histamine in the brain was revived following the identification of H(3) and H(4) receptors some years ago. Complementing classical CNS pharmacology, the development of selective histamine receptor agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists provides the lead for the potential exploitation of the histaminergic system in the treatment of brain pathologies. Although no CNS disease entity has been associated directly to brain histamine dysfunction until now, the H(3) receptor is recognized as a drug target for neuropathic pain, sleep-wake disorders, including narcolepsy, and cognitive impairment associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's disease, while the first H(3) receptor ligands have already entered phase I-III clinical trials. Interestingly, the localization of the immunomodulatory H(4) receptor in the nervous system exposes attractive perspectives for the therapeutic exploitation of this new drug target in neuroimmunopharmacology. This review focuses on a concise presentation of the current ""translational research"" approach that exploits the latest advances in histamine pharmacology for the development of beneficial drug targets for the treatment of neuronal disorders, such as neuropathic pain, cognitive, and sleep-wake pathologies.

One of these genes, referred to in honey bees as Amdop2, shows a close phylogenetic relationship to the a-adrenergic-like octopamine receptor family. In this study we examined in parallel the functional and pharmacological properties of AmDOP2 and the honey bee octopamine receptor, AmOA1. For comparison, pharmacological properties of the honey bee dopamine receptors AmDOP1 and AmDOP3, and the tyramine receptor AmTYR1, were also examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using HEK293 cells heterologously expressing honey bee biogenic amine receptors, we found that activation of AmDOP2 receptors, like AmOA1 receptors, initiates a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels. We found no evidence of calcium signaling via AmDOP1, AmDOP3 or AmTYR1 receptors. AmDOP2- and AmOA1-mediated increases in intracellular calcium were inhibited by 10 ÂµM edelfosine indicating a requirement for phospholipase C-Î² activity in this signaling pathway. Edelfosine treatment had no effect on AmDOP2- or AmOA1-mediated increases in intracellular cAMP. The synthetic compounds mianserin and epinastine, like cis-(Z)-flupentixol and spiperone, were found to have significant antagonist activity on AmDOP2 receptors. All 4 compounds were effective antagonists also on AmOA1 receptors. Analysis of putative ligand binding sites offers a possible explanation for why epinastine acts as an antagonist at AmDOP2 receptors, but fails to block responses mediated via AmDOP1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that AmDOP2, like AmOA1, is coupled not only to cAMP, but also to calcium-signalling and moreover, that the two signalling pathways are independent upstream of phospholipase C-Î² activity. The striking similarity between the pharmacological properties of these 2 receptors suggests an underlying conservation of structural properties related to receptor function. Taken together, these results strongly support phylogenetic analyses indicating that the AmDOP2 and AmOA1 receptor genes are immediate paralogs.",,United States,2011,10.1371/journal.pone.0026809,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22096499

We tested the hypothesis that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) exerts stimulatory and inhibitory effects on hepatic glucose disposal. Ligands of diverse 5-HT receptors were used to identify signaling pathway(s) regulating glucose metabolism in hepatocytes. 5-HT had stimulatory and inhibitory effects on glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes mediated by 5-HT1/2A and 5-HT2B receptors, respectively. Agonists of 5-HT1/2A receptors lowered blood glucose and increased hepatic glycogen after oral glucose loading and also stimulated glycogen synthesis in freshly isolated hepatocytes with greater efficacy than 5-HT. This effect was blocked by olanzapine, an antagonist of 5-HT1/2A receptors. It was mediated by activation of phosphorylase phosphatase, inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase, and activation of glycogen synthase. Unlike insulin action, it was not associated with stimulation of glycolysis and was counteracted by cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors. A role for cdk5 was supported by adaptive changes in the coactivator protein p35 and by elevated glycogen synthesis during overexpression of p35/cdk5. These results support a novel mechanism for serotonin stimulation of hepatic glycogenesis involving cdk5.

Recently, it was found to bind trace amine-1 receptors (TA(1)Rs), which modulate dopaminergic transmission. Accordingly, using mice genetically deprived of TA(1)R (TA(1)-KO), we explored their significance to the actions of MDMA, which robustly activated human adenylyl cyclase-coupled TA(1)R transfected into HeLa cells. In wild-type (WT) mice, MDMA elicited a time-, dose-, and ambient temperature-dependent hypothermia and hyperthermia, whereas TA(1)-KO mice displayed hyperthermia only. MDMA-induced increases in dialysate levels of dopamine (DA) in dorsal striatum were amplified in TA(1)-KO mice, despite identical levels of MDMA itself. A similar facilitation of the influence of MDMA upon dopaminergic transmission was acquired in frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, and induction of locomotion by MDMA was haloperidol-reversibly potentiated in TA(1)-KO versus WT mice. Conversely, genetic deletion of TA(1)R did not affect increases in DA levels evoked by para-chloroamphetamine (PCA), which was inactive at hTA(1) sites. The TA(1)R agonist o-phenyl-3-iodotyramine (o-PIT) blunted the DA-releasing actions of PCA both in vivo (dialysis) and in vitro (synaptosomes) in WT but not TA(1)-KO animals. MDMA-elicited increases in dialysis levels of serotonin (5-HT) were likewise greater in TA(1)-KO versus WT mice, and 5-HT-releasing actions of PCA were blunted in vivo and in vitro by o-PIT in WT mice only. In conclusion, TA(1)Rs exert an inhibitory influence on both dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission, and MDMA auto-inhibits its neurochemical and functional actions by recruitment of TA(1)R.

Rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions had micro-positron emission tomography scans with [(11) C]raclopride at baseline and after two pharmacological challenges with L-DOPAâ€ƒ+â€ƒbenserazide with or without 8-OHDPAT co-treatment. Identical challenge regimens were used with the subsequent microdialysis concomitant with ratings of LID severity. The baseline increase of [(11) C]raclopride-binding potential (BP(ND) ) in lesioned striatum was eliminated by the L-DOPA challenge, while the concurrent administration of 8-OHDPAT prevented this L-DOPA-induced displacement of [(11) C]raclopride significantly in lesioned ventral striatum and near significantly in the dorsal striatum. With microdialysis, the L-DOPA challenge raised the extracellular DA in parallel with the emergence of strong LID. Co-treatment with 8-OHDPAT significantly attenuated the release of extracellular DA and LID. The 8-OHDPAT co-treatment reversed the L-DOPA-induced decrease of [(11) C]raclopride binding and increase of extracellular DA and reduced the severity of LID. The reversal of the effect of L-DOPA on [(11) C]raclopride binding, extracellular DA and LID by 5-HT agonist administration is consistent with the notion that part of the DA increase associated with LID originates in serotonergic neurons.",,England,2012,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2011.07598.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22117574

Although conventional antipsychotics are often used to counter emesis, they can be associated with extrapyramidal symptoms. However, chronic pain can induce sleep disturbance. The authors investigated the effects of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine on morphine-induced emesis and the sleep dysregulation associated with chronic pain. METHODS: A receptor binding assay was performed using mouse whole brain tissue. The emetic response in ferrets was evaluated by counting retching and vomiting behaviors. Catalepsy in mice was evaluated by placing both of their forepaws over a horizontal bar. Released dopamine was measured by an in vivo microdialysis study. Sleep disturbance in mice in a neuropathic pain-like state was assayed by electroencephalogram and electromyogram recordings. RESULTS: Olanzapine showed high affinity for muscarinic M1 receptor in brain tissue. Olanzapine decreased morphine-induced nausea and vomiting in a dose-dependent manner. However, olanzapine at a dose that had an antiemetic effect (0.03 mg/kg) did not induce catalepsy or hyperglycemia. In addition, olanzapine at this dose had no effect on the morphine-induced release of dopamine or inhibition of gastrointestinal transit. Finally, olanzapine inhibited thermal hyperalgesia and completely alleviated the sleep disturbance induced by sciatic nerve ligation. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that olanzapine may be useful for the treatment of morphine-induced emesis and as an adjunct for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with sleep disturbance.",,United States,2012,10.1097/ALN.0b013e31823c7e56,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22126917

Neurobiological connections and testable hypotheses.,Guilarte TR and Opler M and Pletnikov M ,Neurotoxicology,,"Schizophrenia is a devastating neuropsychiatric disorder of unknown etiology. There is general agreement in the scientific community that schizophrenia is a disorder of neurodevelopmental origin in which both genes and environmental factors come together to produce a schizophrenia phenotype later in life. The challenging questions have been which genes and what environmental factors? Although there is evidence that different chromosome loci and several genes impart susceptibility for schizophrenia; and epidemiological studies point to broad aspects of the environment, only recently there has been an interest in studying gene Ã— environment interactions. Recent evidence of a potential association between prenatal lead (Pb(2+)) exposure and schizophrenia precipitated the search for plausible neurobiological connections. The most promising connection is that in schizophrenia and in developmental Pb(2+) exposure there is strong evidence for hypoactivity of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of excitatory amino acid receptors as an underlying neurobiological mechanism in both conditions. A hypofunction of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) complex during critical periods of development may alter neurobiological processes that are essential for brain growth and wiring, synaptic plasticity and cognitive and behavioral outcomes associated with schizophrenia. We also describe on-going proof of concept gene-environment interaction studies of early life Pb(2+) exposure in mice expressing the human mutant form of the disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC-1) gene, a gene that is strongly associated with schizophrenia and allied mental disorders.",,Netherlands,2012,10.1016/j.neuro.2011.11.008,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22178136

Upon parenteral and/or oral administration, dose-dependent (0.63-40.0 mg/kg) actions were observed in diverse procedures. Both acute and subchronic administration of S32212 reduced immobility time in a forced-swim test in rats. Acutely, it also suppressed marble burying and aggressive behavior in mice. Long-term administration of S32212 was associated with rapid (1 week) and sustained (5 weeks) normalization of sucrose intake in rats exposed to chronic mild stress and with elevated levels of mRNA encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampus and amygdala (2 weeks). S32212 accelerated the firing rate of adrenergic perikarya in the locus coeruleus and elevated dialysis levels of noradrenaline in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of freely moving rats. S32212 also elevated the frontocortical levels of dopamine and acetylcholine, whereas 5-HT, amino acids, and histamine were unaffected. These neurochemical actions were paralleled by ""promnemonic"" properties: blockade of scopolamine-induced deficits in radial maze performance and social recognition and reversal of delay-induced impairments in social recognition, social novelty discrimination, and novel object recognition. It also showed anxiolytic actions in a Vogel conflict procedure. Furthermore, in an electroencephalographic study of sleep architecture, S32212 enhanced slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep, while decreasing waking.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Herein, we explored the antidepressant-like effect and its monoaminergic mechanism of the ethanol extracts from Hemerocallis citrina (HCE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Effect of HCE (90, 180 and 360 mg/kg, p.o.) on the immobility time was assessed in the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), and locomotor activity was evaluated in the open-field test (OFT). Additionally, the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) levels involved in the antidepressant-like effect of HCE were also measured in the mice brain regions of frontal cortex and hippocampus. RESULTS: HCE (90, 180 and 360 mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly reduced the immobility time in both the FST and TST without accompanying changes in locomotor activity in the OFT. The pretreatment of mice with WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist), cyproheptadine (3 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2) receptor antagonist), prazosin (62.5 Î¼g/kg, i.p., an Î±(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., an Î±(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (5 mg/kg, i.p., a Î²-adrenoceptor antagonist) or sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist), but not SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D(1) receptor antagonist) prevented the antidepressant-like effect of HCE (360 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST. In addition, HCE enhanced 5-HT and NA levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus as well as elevated DA levels in the frontal cortex. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the antidepressant-like effect of HCE is dependent on the serotonergic (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors), noradrenergic (Î±(1)-, Î±(2)- and Î²-adrenoceptors) and dopaminergic (D(2) receptor) systems as well as the elevation of 5-HT, NA and DA levels in the mouse brain.",,Ireland,2012,10.1016/j.jep.2011.11.059,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22197914

Previously, we used lipopolysaccharide [LPS, 33 Î¼g/kg, intraperitoneal injection] exposure on gestation day 10.5 to mimic maternal bacterial infection in rats and found reduced dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurons in the offspring. In the present study, we examined the anxiety and stress responses of the affected offspring and the neurophysiological changes in their brains. Our results show that LPS rats displayed more anxiety-like behaviors and heightened stress responses. Dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens and serotonin (5-HT) in the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus were significantly reduced in LPS rats. Their glucocorticoid receptors in the dorsal hippocampus and the 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus were also reduced. In addition, chronic but not acute fluoxetine treatment reversed the behavioral changes and increased hippocampal 5-HT(1A) receptor expression. This study demonstrates that LPS exposure during a critical time of embryonic development could produce long-term reduction of DA and 5-HT and other neurophysiological changes; such alterations may be associated with the increases in stress response and anxiety-like behaviors in the offspring.",,Netherlands,2012,10.1016/j.bbi.2011.12.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22198119

It remains unknown, however, whether the presence of flavour cues are required for the ability to maintain constant caloric intake. Also unknown are the brain circuits that may function as the central calorie monitors that control adaptive adjustments in energy intake. Here we show that mice trained to lick a dry spout in order to receive intra-gastric infusions of a fat emulsion maintained constant hourly caloric intake by adjusting the number of dry licks in response to changes in caloric density. Animals also increased dry licking according to hunger levels, and developed conditioned preferences for dry sippers associated with high calorie infusions. Importantly, striatal dopamine levels were closely associated with the amount of calories ingested, rather than with the number of dry licks produced. Dopamine levels in dorsal and ventral striatum also reflected caloric density in mice passively receiving intra-gastric infusions of fat emulsions. Consistent with the above, systemic administration of the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol markedly increased the production of dry licks needed to obtain high-calorie infusions, as if the caloric density of the infusions had been diluted. Conversely, haloperidol markedly decreased the production of dry licks needed to obtain low-calorie infusions. Taken together, our results support the proposition that brain dopamine circuits function as one central sensor of calorie ingestion, since (1) extracellular striatal dopamine levels fluctuate in proportion to the caloric density of nutrients infused in the gut; and (2) inhibiting dopamine receptor signalling disrupts the animals' ability to maintain constant caloric intake across experimental sessions.",,England,2012,10.1113/jphysiol.2011.218289,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22219333

It is also associated with high cognitive functions such as investing effort into decision making, but no established laboratory model is available to detect the behaviors. In the present study, we have developed a novel laboratory rodent model to detect competitive, non-competitive, and no-hurdle foraging conditions that can mimic the corresponding environment in nature. We found that normal rats consistently foraged the food from a food container to the field and spread food into piles in the open field. There was no difference between male and female rats in the amount of foraged food in the competitive, non-competitive, and no-hurdle food foraging tests. The amount of foraged food was consistent each day for five consecutive days with a slight increase in following days. There was no significant difference in the amount of food foraged in the presence or absence of bedding materials. A dramatic decrease of foraged food was found in the rats after administration of haloperidol (dopamine D2 receptor antagonist) in the competitive, non-competitive, and no-hurdle food foraging tests. Treatment with MK-801 (non-competitive N-methy-D-aspartate receptor antagonist) reduced the foraged food in the competitive food foraging test, but did not affect the foraged food in the non-competitive and no-hurdle food foraging tests. Our study provides a simple but consistent analogue of natural food foraging behavior.

We found that S1R is enriched in mouse spinal MN at late stages of embryonic development when it is first visualized in the endoplasmic reticulum. S1Rs appear to concentrate at C-terminals of mouse MN only on the second week of postnatal development. We found that indole-N-methyl transferase (INMT), an enzyme that converts tryptamine into the sigma-1 ligand dimethyltryptamine (DMT), is also localized to postsynaptic sites of C-terminals in close proximity to the S1R.

First we determined the effect of aripiprazole, a dopamine system stabilizer, on the development and expression of ethanol-induced place preference. Both the development and expression of ethanol-induced place preference was significantly suppressed by treatment of aripiprazole. Next, the withdrawal score gradually increased with increasing duration after the withdrawal from ethanol for 6 days in vehicle-treated mice and the maximal score was observed 10 h after the ethanol withdrawal. Aripiprazole caused no changes in the withdrawal score as compared to vehicle-treated mice. Under these conditions we investigated the effect of aripiprazole on the anxiety-like behavior of ethanol physical dependent mice, which were animals subjected to ethanol vapor for 6 days. The significant decrease of time spent in the open arms and number of open arm entries characterize the anxiety-like behavior in ethanol physical dependent mice, compared to control mice.

This review highlights interactions between cannabinoids, and dopamine, to modulate neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity in the context of drug addiction, psychosis and cognition. Modulating endocannabinoid function, as a plasticity based therapeutic strategy, in the above pathologies with particular focus on cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) antagonists/inverse agonists, is discussed. On the basis of the existing literature and of new experimental evidence presented here, CB1 receptor antagonists might be beneficial in disease states associated with hedonic dysregulation, and with cognitive dysfunction in particular in the context of psychosis.

Male, but not female, reelin heterozygous mice showed significantly enhanced MK-801-induced locomotor hyperactivity compared to wildtype controls (7.4-fold vs. 5.2-fold effect of MK-801 over saline, respectively) but there were no genotype differences in the response to amphetamine. Both male and female reelin heterozygous mice showed enhanced effects of MK-801 on startle, but not prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle. There were no group differences in the effect of apomorphine on startle or PPI. The levels of NMDA receptor subunits were not altered in the striatum. In the frontal cortex, male and female reelin heterozygous mice showed significant up-regulation of NR1 subunits, but down-regulation of NR2C subunits, which was associated with significantly elevated NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2C ratios.

Asenapine exhibits higher affinity for several 5-HT receptors and Î±(2)-adrenoceptors than for D(2) receptors. Noteworthy, blockage of both the 5-HT(2A) and Î±(2)-adrenergic receptors has been shown to enhance prefrontal dopamine release induced by D(2) receptor antagonists. Previous results show that asenapine, both systemically and locally, increases dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and that the increased dopamine release largely depends on an intracortical action. Using reverse microdialysis in freely moving rats, we here assessed the potency of low concentrations of asenapine to cause a pharmacologically significant blockage in vivo of 5-HT(2A) receptors and Î±(2)-adrenoceptors within the mPFC, and thus its ability to affect cortical monoamine release by these receptors. Intracortical administration of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), a 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist, increased cortical monoamine release, effects that were antagonized both by asenapine and the selective 5-HT(2A) antagonist M100907. Application of clonidine, an Î±(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, significantly reduced monoamine release in the mPFC. The selective Î±(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan blocked, whereas asenapine partially blocked clonidine-induced cortical dopamine and noradrenaline decrease. The effects of asenapine and idazoxan on clonidine-induced serotonin decrease were less pronounced.

This may be because suitable animal models are largely lacking and existing models are poorly characterized. METHODS: Male 129/SV mice were subjected to 30-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)/reperfusion and serial magnetic resonance imaging scans. A subset of animals received selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram starting 7 days after MCAo. Behavioral assessment was performed at 14 weeks. To identify biological correlates of PSD, we quantified corticosterone levels in serum and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in brain. The integrity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system was assessed using tyrosine hydroxylase and dynorphin in situ hybridizations as well as dopamine transporter autoradiography. RESULTS: Left, but not right, MCAo, elicited anhedonia and increased anxiety and despair. This depression-like syndrome was associated with alterations in the mesolimbic reward system. MCAo resulted in delayed degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in ipsilateral midbrain, which was accompanied by reduced dopamine concentrations and decreased levels of dopamine transporter density along with increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor protein levels in ischemic striatum and increased dynorphin messenger RNA expression in nucleus accumbens. Chronic antidepressant treatment initiated as late as 7 days after stroke reversed the behavioral phenotype, prevented degeneration of dopaminergic midbrain neurons, and attenuated striatal atrophy at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the importance of the dopaminergic system for the development of PSD.

Fast dissociation from D(2) receptors may be one of the elements contributing to the lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) exhibited by newer antipsychotics. Therefore, we screened for specific D(2) receptor blockers with a fast rate of dissociation. Radioligand binding experiments identified N-[1-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazin-3-amine (JNJ-37822681) as a fast-dissociating D(2) ligand. Its D(2) receptor specificity was high compared with atypical antipsychotics, with little activity at receptors associated with unwanted effects [Î±(1), Î±(2), H(1), muscarinic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2C] and for receptors that may interfere with the effects of D(2) antagonism (D(1), D(3), and 5-HT(2A)). JNJ-37822681 occupied D(2) receptors in rat brain at relatively low doses (ED(50) 0.39 mg/kg) and was effective in animal models of psychosis (e.g., inhibition of apomorphine-induced stereotypy or D-amphetamine/phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion). Prolactin levels increased from an ED(50) (0.17 mg/kg, peripheral D(2) receptors) close to the ED(50) required for apomorphine antagonism (0.19 mg/kg, central D(2) receptors), suggesting excellent brain disposition and minimal prolactin release at therapeutic doses. JNJ-37822681 induced catalepsy and inhibited avoidance behavior, but with a specificity margin relative to apomorphine antagonism that was larger than that obtained for haloperidol and similar to that obtained for olanzapine. This larger specificity margin (compared with haloperidol) may reflect lower EPS liability and less behavioral suppression after JNJ-37822681. JNJ-37822681 is a novel, potent, specific, centrally active, fast-dissociating D(2) antagonist with optimal brain disposition, and it is the first compound that allows the evaluation of the potential value of fast D(2) antagonism for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",,United States,2012,10.1124/jpet.111.190702,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22490380

Targeted therapies with more selective action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) that contain a Î²2 subunit (Î²2*nAChRs; *denotes assembly with other subunits) have enjoyed significantly greater success, but exhibit potential for unwanted cardiac, gastrointestinal, and emotive side effects. DISCUSSION: This literature review focuses on the preclinical evidence that suggests that subclasses of Î²2*nAChRs that assemble with the Î±6 subunit may provide an effective target for tobacco cessation. Î±6Î²2*nAChRs have a highly selective pattern of neuroanatomical expression in catecholaminergic nuclei including the ventral tegmental area and its projection regions. Î±6Î²2*nAChRs promote dopamine (DA) neuron activity and DA release in the mesolimbic dopamine system, a brain circuitry that is well-studied for its contributions to addiction behavior. A combination of genetic and pharmacological studies indicates that activation of Î±6Î²2*nAChRs is necessary and sufficient for nicotine psychostimulant effects and nicotine self-administration. Î±6Î²2*nAChRs support maintenance of nicotine use, support the conditioned reinforcing effects of drug-associated cues, and regulate nicotine withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that Î±6Î²2*nAChRs represent a critical pool of high affinity Î²2*nAChRs that regulates nicotine dependence phenotype and suggest that inhibition of these receptors may provide an effective strategy for tobacco cessation therapy.",,England,2012,10.1093/ntr/nts089,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22492084

However, growing recognition of the dopamine (DA) loss and other pathology in extra-striatal brain regions has led to uncertainty whether loss of DA in the striatum is sufficient to cause parkinsonian signs. We tested this hypothesis by infusing cis-flupenthixol (cis-flu; a broad-spectrum D1/D2 receptor antagonist) into different regions of the macaque putamen (3 hemispheres of 2 monkeys) while the animal performed a visually-cued choice reaction time task in which visual cues indicated the arm to reach with and the peripheral target to contact to obtain food reward. Following reward delivery, the animal was required to self-initiate release of the peripheral target and return of the chosen hand to its home position (i.e., without the benefit of external sensory cues or immediate rewards). Infusions of cis-flu at 15 of 26 sites induced prolongations of reaction time (9 of 15 cases), movement duration (6 cases), and/or dwell time of the hand at the peripheral target (8 cases). Dwell times were affected more severely (+95%) than visually-triggered reaction times or movement durations (+25% and +15%, respectively). Specifically, the animal's hand often 'froze' at the peripheral target for up to 25-s, similar to the akinetic freezing episodes observed in PD patients. Across injections, slowing of self-initiation did not correlate in severity with prolongations of visually-triggered reaction time or movement duration, although the latter two were correlated with each other. Episodes of slowed self-initiation appeared primarily in the arm contralateral to the injected hemisphere and were not associated with increased muscle co-contraction or global alterations in behavioral state (i.e., inattention or reduced motivation), consistent with the idea that these episodes reflected a fundamental impairment of movement initiation. We found no evidence for an anatomic topography within the putamen for the effects elicited. We conclude that acute focal blockade of DA transmission in the putamen is sufficient to induce marked akinesia-like impairments. Furthermore, different classes of impairments can be induced independently, suggesting that specific parkinsonian signs have unique pathophysiologic substrates.",,United States,2012,10.1016/j.nbd.2012.03.028,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22498034

In the present study, we assessed the effects of acute restraint stress on different forms of cost/benefit decision-making, and some of the hormonal and neurochemical mechanisms that may underlie these effects. Effort-based decision-making was assessed where rats chose between a low effort/reward (1 press=2 pellets) or high effort/reward option (4 pellets), with the effort requirement increasing over 4 blocks of trials (2, 5, 10, and 20 lever presses). Restraint stress for 1â€‰h decreased preference for the more costly reward and induced longer choice latencies. Control experiments revealed that the effects on decision-making were not mediated by general reductions in motivation or preference for larger rewards. In contrast, acute stress did not affect delay-discounting, when rats chose between a small/immediate vs larger/delayed reward. The effects of stress on decision-making were not mimicked by treatment with physiological doses of corticosterone (1-3â€‰mg/kg). Blockade of dopamine receptors with flupenthixol (0.25â€‰mg/kg) before restraint did not attenuate stress-induced effects on effort-related choice, but abolished effects on choice latencies. These data suggest that acute stress interferes somewhat selectively with cost/benefit evaluations concerning effort costs. These effects do not appear to be mediated solely by enhanced glucocorticoid activity, whereas dopaminergic activation may contribute to increased deliberation times induced by stress. These findings may provide insight into impairments in decision-making and anergia associated with stress-related disorders, such as depression.",,England,2012,10.1038/npp.2012.69,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22569506

PCP also induces a complex set of behaviors in animal models of this disorder. PCP also increases glutamate and dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, brain regions associated with expression of psychosis. Increased motor activation is among the PCP-induced behaviors that have been widely validated as models for the characterization of new antipsychotic drugs. The peptide transmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) activates a group II metabotropic receptor, mGluR3. Polymorphisms in this receptor have been associated with schizophrenia. Inhibitors of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, an enzyme that inactivates NAAG following synaptic release, reduce several behaviors induced by PCP in animal models. This research tested the hypothesis that two structurally distinct NAAG peptidase inhibitors, ZJ43 and 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentane-1,5-dioic acid, would elevate levels of synaptically released NAAG and reduce PCP-induced increases in glutamate and dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. NAAG-like immunoreactivity was found in neurons and presumptive synaptic endings in both regions. These peptidase inhibitors reduced the motor activation effects of PCP while elevating extracellular NAAG levels. They also blocked PCP-induced increases in glutamate but not dopamine or its metabolites. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 blocked these behavioral and neurochemical effects of the peptidase inhibitors. The data reported here provide a foundation for assessment of the neurochemical mechanism through which NAAG achieves its antipsychotic-like behavioral effects and support the conclusion NAAG peptidase inhibitors warrant further study as a novel antipsychotic therapy aimed at mGluR3.",,United States,2012,10.1074/jbc.M112.363226,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22570482

Among the MeOH extract and some alkaloidal fractions at different pHs, the alkaloidal CHCl(3) fraction at pH-9 (2C) showed the highest antipsychotic activity against dopaminergic (DA-D(2)) and serotonergic (5-HT(2A)) receptors in-vitro and amphetamine induced hyperactive mouse model in-vivo. The activity guided isolation of CHCl(3) fraction (2C) afforded six indole alkaloids: 10-methoxytetrahydroalstonine (1), isoreserpiline (2), an isomeric mixture of 11-demethoxyreserpiline (3) and 10-demethoxyreserpiline (4), Î±-yohimbine (5) and reserpiline (6).

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their transcriptional dysregulation are still unclear. The transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been implicated in rodent models of depression. We previously provided evidence that Bdnf expression critically rely on a potent CREB coactivator called CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1). METHODS: To further evaluate the role of CRTC1 in the brain, we generated a knockout mouse line and analyzed its behavioral and molecular phenotype. RESULTS: We found that mice lacking CRTC1 associate neurobehavioral endophenotypes related to mood disorders. Crtc1(-/-) mice exhibit impulsive aggressiveness, social withdrawal, and decreased sexual motivation, together with increased behavioral despair, anhedonia, and anxiety-related behavior in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. They also present psychomotor retardation as well as increased emotional response to stressful events. Crtc1(-/-) mice have a blunted response to the antidepressant fluoxetine in behavioral despair paradigms, whereas fluoxetine normalizes their aggressiveness and their behavioral response in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. Crtc1(-/-) mice strikingly show, in addition to a reduced dopamine and serotonin turnover in the prefrontal cortex, a concomitant decreased expression of several susceptibility genes involved in neuroplasticity, including Bdnf, its receptor TrkB, the nuclear receptors Nr4a1-3, and several other CREB-regulated genes.

Yet it is generally accepted that Type II cells transduce bitter, sweet and umami stimuli. No classical synapses, however, have been found associated with Type II cells. Recent studies indicate that the ionotropic purinergic receptors P2X2/P2X3 are present in rodent taste buds. Taste nerve processes express the ionotropic purinergic receptors (P2X2/P2X3). P2X2/P2X3(Dbl-/-) mice are not responsive to sweet, umami and bitter stimuli, and it has been proposed that ATP acts as a neurotransmitter in taste buds. The goal of the present study is to learn more about the nature of purinergic contacts in rat circumvallate taste buds by examining immunoreactivity to antisera directed against the purinergic receptor P2X2. RESULTS: P2X2-like immunoreactivity is present in intragemmal nerve processes in rat circumvallate taste buds. Intense immunoreactivity can also be seen in the subgemmal nerve plexuses located below the basal lamina. The P2X2 immunoreactive nerve processes also display syntaxin-1-LIR. The immunoreactive nerves are in close contact with the IP(3)R3-LIR Type II cells and syntaxin-1-LIR and/or 5-HT-LIR Type III cells. Taste cell synapses are observed only from Type III taste cells onto P2X2-LIR nerve processes. Unusually large, ""atypical"" mitochondria in the Type II taste cells are found only at close appositions with P2X2-LIR nerve processes. P2X2 immunogold particles are concentrated at the membranes of nerve processes at close appositions with taste cells. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopical studies we believe that both perigemmal and most all intragemmal nerve processes display P2X2-LIR. Moreover, colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy indicates that P2X2-LIR in nerve processes is concentrated at sites of close apposition with Type II cells. This supports the hypothesis that ATP may be a key neurotransmitter in taste transduction and that Type II cells release ATP, activating P2X2 receptors in nerve processes.",,England,2012,10.1186/1471-2202-13-51,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22621423

Here we report on a novel antidepressant strategy to selectively increase DA function in prefrontal cortex (PFC) without the potential tolerance problems associated to DA transporter blockade. This approach is based on previous observations indicating that extracellular DA in rat medial PFC (mPFC) - but not in nucleus accumbens (NAc) - arises from noradrenergic terminals and is sensitive to noradrenergic drugs. A low dose of reboxetine (3 mg/kg i.p.; NE reuptake inhibitor) non-significantly increased extracellular DA in mPFC. Interestingly, its combined administration with 5 mg/kg s.c. mirtazapine (non-selective Î±â‚‚-adrenoceptor antagonist) increased extracellular DA in mPFC (264 Â± 28%), but not in NAc. Extracellular NE (but not 5-HT) in mPFC was also enhanced by the combined treatment (472 Â± 70%). Repeated (Ã—3) reboxetine + mirtazapine administration produced a moderate additional increase in mPFC DA and markedly reduced the immobility time (-51%) in the forced-swim test. Neurochemical and behavioral effects of the reboxetine + mirtazapine combination persisted in rats pretreated with citalopram (3 mg/kg, s.c.), suggesting its potential usefulness to augment SSRI effects. In situ hybridization c-fos studies were performed to examine the brain areas involved in the above antidepressant-like effects, showing changes in c-fos expression in hippocampal and cortical areas. BDNF expression was also increased in the hippocampal formation. Overall, these results indicate a synergistic effect of the reboxetine + mirtazapine combination to increase DA and NE function in mPFC and to evoke robust antidepressant-like responses.",,England,2012,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.05.020,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22652058

A portion of the animals received tricyclic antidepressant treatment, desipramine 20 mg/kg/day, during this period. Animals were then tested behaviorally by forced swimming. Isolation was associated with significantly longer durations of immobility during forced swimming. This was blocked by desipramine treatment. Desipramine treatment did not have a significant effect on the swimming durations of group-housed rats. Hindbrain and midbrain levels of catecholamines were subsequently measured and turnover rates estimated by administration of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or saline. Isolated rats had increased levels and decreased turnover of catecholamines. The increase in norepinephrine but not dopamine levels was blocked by desipramine, while antidepressant effects on turnover could not be tested with this method. Reduced social stimulation thus appears to be associated with reduced catecholamine release which may result in the accumulation of these transmitters in the central nervous system. Treatment with desipramine appeared essentially to compensate for reduced social stimulation, blocking isolation-induced noradrenergic neurochemical changes, while having few significant effects on control animals.

These differences may inform us about the biology of PPI deficits in disorders such as schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: After confirming these strain-based PPI differences, we measured expression of four genes in NAC and other regions that regulate PPI: medial prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus (VH). METHODS: Startle and PPI were assessed in SD and LE rats administered D-amphetamine (0 vs. 4.5 mg/kg, sc). Two weeks later, brain tissue was processed for comt, nrg1, grid2, and csnk1e expression; blood comt expression was also tested. RESULTS: Data confirmed expected PPI phenotypes. Gene expression levels differed across strains, sexes, and brain regions, with LE > SD expression in most genes and regions, and female > male expression for all NAC genes. Within any brain region, expression of the four genes was highly inter-correlated; across regions, correlations were less robust, reflecting distinct strain- or sex-based subgroups. PPI amphetamine sensitivity at 120 ms correlated significantly with NAC nrg1 expression, while amphetamine sensitivity for 30 ms PPI and startle magnitude correlated significantly with VH nrg1 and blood comt expression.

Previous research indicates that neostriatal mechanisms are involved in the generation of tremulous jaw movements, but the striatal output pathways involved in these movements remain uncertain. One important pathway for striatal output is the GABAergic striatopallidal system. The present studies were undertaken to determine if extracellular levels of GABA in globus pallidus are associated with the induction of tremulous jaw movements by either a dopamine D2 antagonist (haloperidol) or a cholinomimetic (the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine). The first experiment studied the effects of both acute and repeated (i.e. 8 days) administration of the D2 antagonist haloperidol. In the second experiment, the effect of acute administration of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine on GABA levels in the globus pallidus was examined. In both experiments, behavioral observations of tremulous jaw movements were conducted in parallel with the collection of microdialysis samples. Acute and repeated haloperidol treatment induced tremulous jaw movements, and significantly elevated extracellular GABA in globus pallidus. Pooling across all treatment groups, there was a significant positive correlation between pallidal GABA levels and the number of tremulous jaw movements induced during the first three samples collected after injection. However, injection of 4.0mg/kg pilocarpine had no effect on pallidal GABA release, despite the robust induction of tremulous jaw movements. These results indicate that the tremulous jaw movements induced by dopamine D2 antagonism and those induced through muscarinic receptor stimulation may be generated via distinct mechanisms.",,Netherlands,2012,10.1016/j.bbr.2012.06.011,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22728308

For example, some have argued that phasic dopamine signaling provides a prediction-error signal necessary for stimulus-reward learning, whereas others have hypothesized that dopamine is not necessary for learning per se, but for attributing incentive motivational value ('incentive salience') to reward cues. These psychological processes are difficult to tease apart, because they tend to change together. To disentangle them we took advantage of natural individual variation in the extent to which reward cues are attributed with incentive salience, and asked whether dopamine (specifically in the core of the nucleus accumbens) is necessary for the expression of two forms of pavlovian-conditioned approach behavior--one in which the cue acquires powerful motivational properties (sign-tracking) and another closely related one in which it does not (goal-tracking). After acquisition of these conditioned responses (CRs), intra-accumbens injection of the dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol markedly impaired the expression of a sign-tracking CR, but not a goal-tracking CR. Furthermore, dopamine antagonism did not produce a gradual extinction-like decline in behavior, but maximally impaired expression of a sign-tracking CR on the very first trial, indicating the effect was not due to new learning (i.e. it occurred in the absence of new prediction-error computations). The data support the view that dopamine in the accumbens core is not necessary for learning stimulus-reward associations, but for attributing incentive salience to reward cues, transforming predictive conditional stimuli into incentive stimuli with powerful motivational properties.",,France,2012,10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08217.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22780554

In the present study, we further examined the pharmacological action of PGD on prolactin (PRL) secretion using in vitro and in vivo models, with specific attention to the role of dopaminergic mediators and other sex hormones. Treatment with PGD at 1-5mg/ml significantly suppressed PRL secretion and synthesis in MMQ cells, a model of hyperPRL derived from pituitary adenoma cells. The suppressive effects were completely abolished by pretreatment with 10Î¼M haloperidol, a dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist. Consistent with a D(2)-action, PGD did not affect PRL in rat pituitary lactotropic tumor-derived GH3 cells that lack the D(2) receptor expression but significantly increased the expression of D(2) receptors and dopamine transporters (DAT) in PC12 cells. In a rat model of hyperPRL, produced by repeated injection of the dopamine blocker metoclopramide (MCP), chronic PGD (2.5-10g/kg daily) significantly reduced elevated serum PRL. The reduction in magnitude was similar to that elicited by bromocriptine (BMT), a dopamine D(2) receptor agonist currently used for treatment of hyperPRL. Neither PGD nor BMT altered serum estradiol, but PGD reversed decreased serum progesterone to control level, whereas BMT did not. These results indicate that the anti-hyperPRL effects of PGD are associated not only with D(2) receptor and DAT modulation, but also with a normalization of other sex hormone dysfunction.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Here we investigated the effects of first and second generation antipsychotics (FGAs and SGAs, respectively) on gamma oscillations. The FGAs haloperidol, flupenthixol, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene and the SGAs clozapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, amisulpride were applied on gamma oscillations induced by acetylcholine and physostigmine in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. KEY RESULTS: Antipsychotics inhibited the power of gamma oscillations and increased the bandwidth of the gamma band. Haloperidol and clozapine had the highest inhibitory effects. To determine which receptor is responsible for the alterations in gamma oscillations, the effects of the antipsychotics were plotted against their pK(i) values for 19 receptors and analysed for correlation. Our results indicated that 5-HT(3) receptors have an enhancing effect on gamma oscillations whereas dopamine D(3) receptors inhibit them. To test this prediction, m-chlorophenylbiguanide, PD 128907 and CP 809101, selective agonists at 5-HT(3) , D(3) and 5-HT(2C) receptors were applied and revealed that 5-HT(3) receptors indeed enhanced the gamma power whereas D(3) receptors reduced it. As predicted, 5-HT(2C) receptors had no effects on gamma oscillations.

However, the molecular changes induced by increased dopaminergic activity associated with schizophrenia are not clear. Increased levels of Î”FosB have been found in association with chronic subcortical hyperdopaminergic activity following repeated cocaine or amphetamine administration. Therefore, we investigated Î”FosB signaling in a putative neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia showing chronic subcortical hyperdopaminergic activity. Increased protein levels of the transcription factor Î”FosB as well as cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk-5), p35, p25 and the GluR2 subunit of the AMPA glutamate receptor were observed in the nucleus accumbens (NA). Cdk-5, p35 and GlurR2 are all proteins regulated by Î”FosB, while p25 is a degradation product of p35. Increased total protein levels of cdk-5, p35 and p25 resulted in increased cdk-5 kinase activity as determined by increased phosphorylation of dopamine and adenosine regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP32) at Thr(75) in the NA. DARPP32 Thr(75) is selectively phosphorylated by cdk-5 and phosphorylation of DARPP32 at Thr(75) suppresses DARPP32 activity, a critical step in the regulation of both glutamatergic and dopaminergic activity in neurons. We also found that apomorphine-induced locomotor activity was further increased following intra-accumbens infusions of roscovitine, a cdk-5 blocker, in a dose-dependent manner.

Because neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) dramatically increases extracellular dopamine levels in the hippocampus, we investigated the relationship between NRG/ErbB and dopamine signaling in hippocampal Î³ oscillations. Using agonists for different D1- and D2-type dopamine receptors, we found that the D4 receptor (D4R) agonist PD168077, but not D1/D5 and D2/D3 agonists, increases Î³ oscillation power, and its effect is blocked by the highly specific D4R antagonist L-745,870. Using double in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence histochemistry, we show that hippocampal D4R mRNA and protein are more highly expressed in GAD67-positive GABAergic interneurons, many of which express the NRG-1 receptor ErbB4. Importantly, D4 and ErbB4 receptors are coexpressed in parvalbumin-positive basket cells that are critical for Î³ oscillations. Last, we report that D4R activation is essential for the effects of NRG-1 on network activity because L-745,870 and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine dramatically reduce the NRG-1-induced increase in Î³ oscillation power. This unique link between D4R and ErbB4 signaling on Î³ oscillation power, and their coexpression in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, suggests a cellular mechanism that may be compromised in different psychiatric disorders affecting cognitive control. These findings are important given the association of a DRD4 polymorphism with alterations in attention, working memory, and Î³ oscillations, and suggest potential benefits of D4R modulators for targeting cognitive deficits.",,United States,2012,10.1073/pnas.1201011109,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22822214

Genetic inactivation of Tph2 function in mice led to the identification of phenotypic changes, ranging from growth retardation and late-onset obesity, to enhanced conditioned fear response, increased aggression and depression-like behaviour. This spectrum of consequences, which are amplified by stress-related epigenetic interactions, are attributable to deficient brain 5-HT synthesis during development and adulthood. Human data relating altered TPH2 function to personality traits of negative emotionality and neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in cognitive control and emotion regulation are based on genetic association and are therefore not as robust as the experimental mouse results.

Buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist approved for the treatment of anxiety, has been reported to also bind with high affinity to D3 and D4 receptors. In view of this biochemical profile, the present research was conducted to examine both the functional effects of buspirone on these receptors and, in non-human primates, its ability to modify the reinforcing effects of i.v. cocaine in a behaviourally selective manner. Radioligand binding studies confirmed that buspirone binds with high affinity to recombinant human D3 and D4 receptors (âˆ¼98 and âˆ¼29 nm respectively).

Dopamine has been implicated in the pathophysiology of the disorder by preclinical and clinical evidence. Preclinical studies have examined two main characteristics of AN: reduction in food intake (diet restriction) and hyperactivity. Diet restriction has been associated with reduced dopamine levels in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and the dorsal striatum. Animal hyperactivity following diet restriction has been linked to increased dopamine in the hypothalamus. Increased dopamine in the nucleus accumbens was associated with food administration, but not food expectation. Tyrosine and dopaminergic antagonists normalized anorexia-like behaviors in animal models of AN, but did not restore body weight. Clinical studies on the etiology of AN have produced contradictory findings. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites have been reported to be decreased or normal under conditions of low weight, whereas they tended to normalize when the weight was restored. Plasma and urinary levels of dopamine and its metabolites have been found to be normal, increased, and decreased. Neuroendocrine studies suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission is increased in AN. However, recent neuroimaging studies lend support to the increase in binding of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum, which favors the opposite theory that intrasynaptic dopamine is indeed decreased.

It is important to note that the majority of these studies have been performed in ""normal"" experimental animals. Given that these animals do not possess the aberrant neuronal information processing typically associated with schizophrenia, the aim of the current study was to examine the dopamine D2 receptor system in a rodent model of schizophrenia. Here, we demonstrate that methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)-treated rats display an enhanced effect of quinpirole on dopamine neuron activity and an aberrant locomotor response to D2-like receptor activation, suggesting changes in postsynaptic D2-like receptor function. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the enhanced response to D2-like ligands in MAM-treated rats, we examined the expression of D2, D3, and dopamine transporter mRNA in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. MAM-treated rats displayed a significant increase in dopamine D3 receptor mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens with no significant changes in the expression of the D2 receptor.

In the second set of experiments, the involvement of the monoaminergic systems in the antidepressant-like activity of Eugenia brasiliensis was evaluated by treating mice with several pharmacological agonists and antagonists. The effects of the combined administration of sub-effective doses of Eugenia brasiliensis and the antidepressants fluoxetine, imipramine and bupropion were also evaluated. RESULTS: The administration of the extracts from Eugenia brasiliensis, Eugenia catharinae and Eugenia umbelliflora, but not Eugenia beaurepaireana and Eugenia uniflora, exerted a significant antidepressant-like effect, without altering locomotor activity. The behavioral profile was similar to fluoxetine. Pre-treatment of mice with ketanserin, haloperidol, SCH23390, sulpiride, prazosin and yohimbine prevented the reduction of immobility time induced by Eugenia brasiliensis. Treatment with sub-effective doses of WAY100635, SKF38393, apomorphine, phenylephrine, but not clonidine, combined with a sub-effective dose of Eugenia brasiliensis decreased the immobility time in the TST. Furthermore, the combined administration of sub-effectives doses of Eugenia brasiliensis with fluoxetine, imipramine and bupropion produced an antidepressant-like effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study show, for the first time, the antidepressant-like effect of species of the genus Eugenia, especially Eugenia brasiliensis, whose effects in the TST seem to be mediated by serotoninergic (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2) receptors), noradrenergic (Î±(1)-adrenoceptor) and dopaminergic (dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors) systems.",,Ireland,2012,10.1016/j.jep.2012.07.038,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22884868

DA then acts as a negative regulator of insulin secretion via its action on D2R, which are also expressed on Î²-cells.

How estrogens influence DA function remains unclear, in part, because the ultrastructural localization of estrogen receptors (ER) in the dSTR is not known. Light microscopic studies of the dSTR have suggested the presence of ER. This experiment used electron microscopy to determine whether these ER are at extranuclear sites in the dSTR, providing evidence for a mechanism through which estrogen could rapidly affect DA transmission. The dSTR was labeled with antibodies for ERÎ±, ERÎ², and G protein-coupled ER 1 (GPER-1) to confirm whether these ER were present in this brain area. After this, the dSTR was dual labeled with antibodies for ERÎ± or GPER-1 and tyrosine hydroxylase or vesicular acetylcholine transporter to determine whether ER are localized to dopaminergic and/or cholinergic processes, respectively. Ultrastructural analysis revealed immunoreactivity (IR) for ERÎ±, ERÎ², and GPER-1 exclusively at extranuclear sites throughout the dSTR. ERÎ±-, ERÎ²-, and GPER-1-IR are mostly frequently observed in axons and glial profiles but are also localized to other neuronal profiles. Dual labeling revealed that ERÎ±- and GPER-1-IR is not associated with DA axons and terminals but is sometimes associated with cholinergic neurons. Because these receptors are exclusively extranuclear in the dSTR, binding at these receptors likely affects neurotransmission via nongenomic mechanisms.",,United States,2012,10.1210/en.2012-1458,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22919059

While these responses are usually transient, LPS injection caused prolonged depressive-like behavior in fractalkine receptor deficient mice (CX3CR1(-/-)) that was associated with exaggerated microglial activation and induction of the tryptophan (TRP) degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). IDO activation and subsequent generation of neuroactive kynurenine metabolites may have a pivotal role in the development of depression. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which LPS-induced depressive-like behavior in CX3CR1(-/-) mice was dependent on IDO activation. CX3CR1(-/-) mice were implanted prior to LPS challenge with a slow release pellet of 1-methyl-tryptophan (1-MT), a competitive inhibitor of IDO. Here we show that the depressive-like behavior evident in CX3CR1(-/-) mice 72 h after LPS injection was abrogated by inhibition of IDO. LPS also decreased body weight and locomotor activity in CX3CR1(-/-) mice, but these effects were independent of 1-MT. Consistent with the increased metabolism of TRP by IDO, the ratio of 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) to TRP was increased in the brain 72 h after LPS. Increased serotonin (5-HT) turnover was also evident in the brain. The LPS-associated increases in both 3-HK:TRP and 5-HIAA:5-HT ratios were prevented by the inhibition of IDO. Last, IDO blockade attenuated microglial activation in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus 72 h after LPS. Collectively these data indicate that LPS-induced IDO activation contributes to persistent microglial activation and depressive-like behavior in CX3CR1(-/-) mice.",,Netherlands,2013,10.1016/j.bbi.2012.08.008,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22926082

Recent studies revealed that both genetic and environmental risk factors for the disease disturb not only embryonic, but also postnatal neurogenesis, possible contributing to neurochemical alterations associated with schizophrenia. Several recent patents proposed therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia by increasing postnatal neurogenesis. It remains, however, unclear, how such pro-neurogenic interventions could ameliorate alterations in neurotransmitter systems associated with the disease, such as the dopamine system. Here we review these patents in the context of the existent data about postnatal neurogenesis in the subventricular zone in rodents and primates. We discuss also in light of a recently proposed theoretical model the possible relevance of disturbed neurogenesis for the dopamine system, focusing on the dopamine receptors associated with neurogenesis, the D3 receptors, and a D3-expressing structure derived from the subventricular zone, the Islands of Calleja.

Of the five known DA receptor subtypes, the D3 receptor has the highest affinity to DA, and D3-mediated actions are mainly inhibitory. Using an animal model of spinal sensorimotor dysfunction, the D3 receptor knockout mouse (D3KO), we investigated the physiological consequences of D3 receptor dysfunction on pain-associated signaling pathways in the spinal cord, the initial integration site for the processing of pain signaling. In the D3KO spinal cord, inhibitory actions of DA on the proprioceptive monosynaptic stretch reflex are converted from depression to facilitation, but its effects on longer-latency and pain-associated reflex responses and the effects of FM have not been studied. Using behavioral approaches in vivo, we found that D3KO animals exhibit reduced paw withdrawal latencies to thermal pain stimulation (Hargreaves' test) over wild type (WT) controls. Electrophysiological and pharmacological approaches in the isolated spinal cord in vitro showed that constant current stimulation of dorsal roots at a pain-associated frequency was associated with a significant reduction in the frequency-dependent modulation of longer-latency reflex (LLRs) responses but not monosynaptic stretch reflexes (MSRs) in D3KO. Application of the D1 and D2 receptor agonists and the voltage-gated calcium-channel ligand, pregabalin, but not DA, was able to restore the frequency-dependent modulation of the LLR in D3KO to WT levels. Thus we demonstrate that nociception-associated LLRs and proprioceptive MSRs are differentially modulated by frequency, dopaminergics and the Ca(2+) channel ligand, pregabalin. Our data suggest a role for the DA D3 receptor in pain modulation and identify the D3KO as a possible model for increased nociception.",,United States,2012,10.1016/j.expneurol.2012.09.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-22995602

We focus initially on models of dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysfunction. Then, we consider advances in the genetics of schizophrenia and mutant models relating to replicable risk genes. Lastly, we extend this discussion by exemplifying two new variant approaches in mutant mice that may serve as prototypes for advancing antipsychotic drug development.

Valproate (VPA), a first-line medication for bipolar disorder, is known to have histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor activity, but the relationship between its efficacy as a mood stabilizer and HDAC inhibitory activity is unclear. Here we provide evidence that prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4), an intracellular binding partner of dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2), plays a role in mediating the effectiveness of VPA. We found that chronic VPA treatment enhanced the expression of Par-4 in cultured neurons and adult mouse brains. This Par-4 induction phenomenon occurred at the transcriptional level and was correlated with an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation of the Par-4 promoter regions. Furthermore, chronic VPA treatment potentiated the suppression of the cAMP signaling cascade upon dopamine stimulation, which was blocked by sulpiride treatment.

When expressed at the cell surface, rat Taar4 pharmacology was very similar to that of TA(1) and coupled to the GÎ±(s) -protein/AC pathway.

The dentate gyrus receives a major serotonergic input from the brainstem raphe nuclei, and the serotonergic system may regulate neurogenesis in the developing and mature hippocampus. The aim of this work was to investigate changes which may be associated with abnormal functioning of the serotonergic system in the pilocarpine model of epilepsy, where spontaneous seizures are induced by administration of pilocarpine at 6 weeks of age. Application of serotonin (100 Î¼M) led to a transient hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential and decrease of the input resistance mediated by the 5-HT(1A) receptor that was similar between control and pilocarpine-treated animals and unaffected by the age of the animal. In the younger, but not in older control animals, serotonin led to a 5-HT(2) receptor-mediated long-term depression of evoked postsynaptic currents, a normal functional shift in the early adulthood of the Wistar rat. In pilocarpine-treated animals, this long-term depression persisted in older animals, indicating impaired maturation of the dentate gyrus.

In contrast, vortioxetine failed to alter the reducing action of 3 d treatment of flesinoxan. Acute dosing of vortioxetine inhibited neuronal firing activity more potently than fluoxetine. SR57227 prevented the suppressant effect of vortioxetine, but not of fluoxetine. In contrast, flesinoxan failed to modify the suppressant effect of vortioxetine acutely administered. Differently to fluoxetine, vortioxetine suppressed neuronal firing without saturating occupancy at the SERT. Vortioxetine produced a markedly faster recovery of 5-HT neuronal firing than fluoxetine.

Rats were either sham-operated or given a bilateral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (4 micrograms in 0.4 microliter) into the prefrontal cortex which resulted in a specific and almost complete (80%) reduction of local DA. Three weeks after surgery, sham and lesioned rats were subjected to one of the following experimental procedures involving (1) controllable or (2) uncontrollable events: (1) the punished drinking test and a FR1/FR7 schedule of food/shock presentation; (2) the forced swimming test and the learned helplessness paradigm. DA depletion in the prefrontal cortex resulted in an increase in punished responding in the drinking test and under the FR schedule; the anti-punishment effects of diazepam (2 mg/kg) were not modified. Lesions also induced a reduction in immobility duration in the forced swimming test but failed to affect the induction of escape deficits in rats trained for learned helplessness. In the latter two models, DA depletion in the prefrontal cortex did not modify the antidepressant effects of desipramine (32 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg/day, respectively). These results suggest that controllable and acute aversive situations may be modulated by DA neurones in the prefrontal cortex. DA neurones, however, may not be crucial in the modulation of delayed and uncontrollable stress-related behaviours.

This study aimed at identifying the signalling pathways for the vasoconstrictor response to tryptamine in rat isolated perfused mesenteric arterial beds and co-released vasodilator modulators of tryptamine-mediated vasoconstriction. Tryptamine caused concentration-dependent vasoconstriction of the mesenteric bed, measured as increases in perfusion pressure. These were inhibited by the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, ritanserin, indicating mediation via 5-HT(2A) receptors. The response was inhibited by the phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase A(2) (iPLA(2)) inhibitors, U-73122 and PACOCF(3), suggesting involvement of phospholipase pathways. Activation of these pathways by tryptamine releases cyclooxygenase (COX) products since indomethacin (non-selective inhibitor of COX-1/2) and nimesulide (selective COX-2 inhibitor) reduced the vasoconstriction. The most likely COX vasoconstrictor product was prostaglandin PGE(2) since the responses to tryptamine were reduced by AH-6809, a non-selective EP(1) receptor antagonist. Involvement of the Rho-kinase pathway in the tryptamine-evoked vasoconstriction was also indicated by its reduction by the Rho-kinase inhibitors, Y-27,632 and fasudil. The tryptamine vasoconstriction is modulated by the co-released endothelial vasodilator, nitric oxide. Thus, circulating tryptamine can regulate mesenteric blood flow through a cascade of signalling pathways secondary to stimulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors.",,United States,2013,10.1016/j.vph.2012.10.007,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23117109

Recent studies have focused on pharmacological approaches combined with exposure therapy to augment extinction. In this study, we elucidated the therapeutic potential of the serotonin 1A (5-HT(1A) ) receptor agonist tandospirone compared with the effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate partial agonist D-cycloserine (DCS), focusing on the possible involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms. We used a rat model of juvenile stress [aversive footshock (FS)] exposure during the third postnatal week (3wFS). The 3wFS group exhibited extinction deficit reflected in sustained fear-related behavior and synaptic dysfunction in the hippocampal CA1 field and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which are responsible for extinction processes. Tandospirone administration (5 mg/kg, i.p.) before and after the extinction trials ameliorated both the behavioral deficit and synaptic dysfunction, i.e., synaptic efficacy in the CA1 field and mPFC associated with extinction training and retrieval, respectively, was potentiated in the tandospirone-treated 3wFS group. Extracellular dopamine release in the mPFC was increased by extinction retrieval in the non-FS control group. This facilitation was not observed in the 3wFS group; however, tandospirone treatment increased cortical dopamine levels after extinction retrieval. DCS (15 mg/kg, i.p.) also ameliorated the extinction deficit in the 3wFS group, but impaired extinction in the non-FS control group. These results suggest that tandospirone has therapeutic potential for enhancing synaptic efficacy associated with extinction processes by involving dopaminergic mechanisms.

In contrast, TH+/- and NR2A-/- mice displayed neither behavioural abnormalities nor activation of intracellular signalling pathways in the NAc.

Cotreatment with lithium and amantadine prevented the changes in DA biochemistry as well as the proliferation of DA receptors normally associated with chronic haloperidol treatment.

The role of glycine in excitatory neurotransmission is related to its coagonist action at glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. The glycine levels in the synaptic cleft rise many times higher during synaptic activation assuring that glycine spills over into the extrasynaptic space. Another possible origin of extrasynaptic glycine is the efflux of glycine occurring from astrocytes associated with glutamatergic synapses. The release of glycine from neuronal or glial origins exhibits several differences compared to that of biogenic amines or other amino acid neurotransmitters. These differences appear in an external Ca(2+)- and temperature-dependent manner, conferring unique characteristics on glycine as a neurotransmitter. Glycine transporter type-1 at synapses may exhibit neural and glial forms and plays a role in controlling synaptic glycine levels and the spill over rate of glycine from the synaptic cleft into the extrasynaptic biophase. Non-synaptic glycine transporter type-1 regulates extrasynaptic glycine concentrations, either increasing or decreasing them depending on the reverse or normal mode operation of the carrier molecule. While we can, at best, only estimate synaptic glycine levels at rest and during synaptic activation, glycine concentrations are readily measurable via brain microdialysis technique applied in the extrasynaptic space. The non-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor may obtain glycine for activation following its spill over from highly active synapses or from its release mediated by the reverse operation of non-synaptic glycine transporter-1. The sensitivity of non-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors to glutamate and glycine is many times higher than that of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors making the former type of receptor the primary target for drug action. Synaptic and non-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors mediate different neural functions, many of which are not clearly defined at present. Non-synaptic glycine transporter-1 and its blockade by inhibitory drugs may be important in drug therapy interventions, such as for reducing negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",,United States,2013,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.12.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23266673

In this study, the roles of the dopaminergic nervous system on the regulation of daily locomotor activity rhythm were investigated in Drosophila melanogaster. Reduced synaptic DA release by expressing tetanus toxin gradually attenuated peak activity levels by altering activity patterns, particularly under constant darkness. Besides, flies with a mutant dopamine transporter fumin (fmn), in which the synaptic DA levels were elevated, displayed increased activities in both daytime and nighttime, but did more so at nighttime, suggesting that DA function is involved in regulation of fruit fly's nocturnal locomotor activities. Furthermore, flies treated with bromocriptine, an agonist of Drosophila dopamine D2 receptor (dD2R), exhibited nocturnal locomotor hyperactivity in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was inhibited in dD2R knockdown flies. When mutant flies null for period (per), timeless (tim), dClock (dClk), or cycle (cyc) were treated with bromocriptine, only cycle-null flies (cyc(01)) did not show induced nocturnal hyperactivities, suggesting that cyc might play a role in bromocriptine-induced nocturnal hyperactivities. Elevation of experimental temperature also increased nocturnal activities at the expense of daytime activities. The heat-induced increase in nocturnal activities gradually returned to basal levels at continuously elevated temperature. Inhibition of DA synthesis did not suppress heat-induced early development of nocturnal hyperactivity but prevented gradual decrement of initially elevated nocturnal activities, suggesting that DA impinges on certain adaptive roles in response to changes in environmental temperature. These results overall suggest that controlling dopaminergic transmission is important for daily locomotor behavior and bromocriptine-induced nocturnal hyperactivity which is mediated through dD2R receptor and CYC functions. In parallel to these results, excessive activation of dopaminergic neurotransmission, the primary cause of schizophrenia, is associated with abnormally elevated nocturnal locomotor activities through D2-type receptor in Drosophila. The results suggest that fruit flies are an excellent model system to provide some answers to previously unexplainable observations regarding the compromised dopaminergic nervous system and the related therapeutic agents.",,England,2013,10.3109/07420528.2012.741169,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23286280

Dysregulation of dopaminergic signaling is associated with various neuropsychiatric disorders. Consequently, dopamine-regulating drugs are effectively used in treating these disorders, such as L-DOPA for Parkinson's disease, methylphenidate for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or antipsychotics for schizophrenia. As a result, there has been much interest in dissecting signaling networks in the two morphologically indistinguishable D1- and D2-receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons. Our previous results highlighted a role for casein kinase 2 (CK2) in the modulation of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) signaling in cells. METHODS: To study the importance of CK2 in vivo, we have selectively knocked out CK2, in either D1- or D2-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and characterized the mice behaviorally and biochemically (n = 4-18). RESULTS: The D1-MSN knockout mice exhibited distinct behavioral phenotypes including novelty-induced hyperlocomotion and exploratory behavior, defective motor control, and motor learning. All of these behavioral traits are indicative of dysregulated dopamine signaling and the underlying mechanism appears to be an alteration of D1R signaling. In support of this hypothesis, D1R levels were upregulated in the knockout mice, as well as phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic adenosine monophosphate [cAMP]-regulated phospho-protein of 32 kDa), most of the behavioral phenotypes were abolished by the D1R antagonist, SCH23390, and the D2-MSN knockout mice displayed no obvious behavioral phenotype.

Pilocarpine (350mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30min after piperine (2.5, 5, 10 and 20mg/kg, i.p.) which significantly increased latencies to 1st convulsion and to death, and percentage of survivals. These parameters were also increased in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with atropine plus piperine (10 and 2.5mg/kg, respectively), as related to the pilocarpine group. However, they were not altered in the pilocarpine groups pretreated with memantine (a NMDA-type glutamate receptors blocker, 2mg/kg, p.o.) or nimodipine (a calcium channel blocker, 10mg/kg, p.o.), both associated with piperine (1 or 2.5mg/kg), as compared to the piperine plus pilocarpine group.

After a brief overview of the anatomical distribution of the 5-HT-ergic system in the key brain areas that govern aggression and suicidal behaviours, the implication of 5-HT markers (5-HT receptors, transporter as well as synthetic and metabolic enzymes) in these conditions is discussed. In this regard, particular emphasis is placed on the integration of pharmacological and genetic evidence from animal studies with the findings of human experimental and genetic association studies. Traditional views postulated an inverse relationship between 5-HT and aggression and suicidal behaviours; however, ample evidence has shown that this perspective may be overly simplistic, and that such pathological manifestations may reflect alterations in 5-HT homoeostasis due to the interaction of genetic, environmental and gender-related factors, particularly during early critical developmental stages.

We address basic questions about neural processes underlying SPC, including whether neurons that mediate reward or punishment signals in reinforcement learning participate in association between neutral sensory stimuli. In crickets, we have suggested that octopaminergic (OA-ergic) or dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons participate in memory acquisition and retrieval in appetitive or aversive conditioning, respectively. Crickets that had been trained to associate an odor (CS2) with a visual pattern (CS1) (phase 1) and then to associate CS1 with water reward or quinine punishment (phase 2) exhibited a significantly increased or decreased preference for CS2 that had never been paired with the US, demonstrating successful SPC. Injection of an OA or DA receptor antagonist at different phases of the SPC training and testing showed that OA-ergic or DA-ergic neurons do not participate in learning of CS2-CS1 association in phase 1, but that OA-ergic neurons participate in learning in phase 2 and memory retrieval after appetitive SPC training. We also obtained evidence suggesting that association between CS2 and US, which should underlie conditioned response of crickets to CS2, is formed in phase 2, contrary to the standard theory of SPC assuming that it occurs in the final test.

This functional CB1 receptor tolerance poses a hurdle in the development of MAGL inhibitors for therapeutic use. Consequently, the present study tested whether repeated administration of low-dose JZL184 maintains its antinociceptive actions in the chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve neuropathic pain model and protective effects in a model of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastric hemorrhages.

The cause of serotonin deficiency in depression was attributed to the shunt of TRP ""metabolism away from serotonin production towards KYN production"" due to cortisol-induced activation of liver enzyme, tryptophan 2,3- dioxygenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of TRP - KYN pathway. Prof. Lapin suggested and discovered that KYN and its metabolites affect brain functions, and proposed the role of neurokynurenines in pathogenesis of depression and action mechanisms of antidepressant effect (kynurenine hypothesis). Further research suggested the antidepressant and cognition- enhancing effects of post-serotonin metabolite, N-acetylserotonin (NAS), an agonist to tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor; and link between depression and chronic inflammation-associated disorders (e.g., insulin resistance, hepatitis C virus) via inflammation-induced activation of indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase, brain located rate-limiting enzyme of TRY - KYN metabolism.

The various antipsychotics induce extrapyramidal symptoms, impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, weight gain, hypertension and arrhythmias, with variable frequency. Second-generation antipsychotics appear to have several advantages over first-generation antipsychotics, including a claimed better action on cognitive function and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and lower frequency of extrapyramidal side effects; however, their use is associated with a greater frequency of metabolic and cardiovascular disturbances. The mechanisms of these important side effects are not well understood, and generic approaches (psychoeducational programmes and symptomatic therapies) have been proposed to limit their severity. Extensive data from the literature indicate that autonomic nervous system dysfunction--intrinsic to schizophrenia and strongly exacerbated by antipsychotic treatment--is the cause of the pervasive metabolic and vascular dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia. In this article, we marshal further literature data to argue that the metabolic and cardiovascular side effects of antipsychotics are primarily mediated by their ability to block peripheral dopamine receptors, which physiologically modulate sympathetic activity. We also propose that these effects might be overcome by providing peripheral dopaminergic stimulation.",,New Zealand,2013,10.1007/s40263-013-0054-1,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23533011

However, patients can continue to demonstrate cognitive impairments even when apparently clinically recovered. Drugs that potentiate serotonin (5-HT) function, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are the mainstay of treatment for depression. Nevertheless, our understanding of the effects of SSRIs and other conventional antidepressant therapy on cognitive function in healthy humans and depressed patients remains limited. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to provide a concise overview for clinicians on the impact of pharmacological manipulation of 5-HT on cognitive function in healthy humans with additional reference to animal models where human data are lacking, particularly regarding specific 5-HT receptor subtype modulation. FINDINGS: The most consistent observation following manipulation of serotonin levels in humans is that low extracellular 5-HT levels are associated with impaired memory consolidation. Preclinical data show that agonism and antagonism at specific 5-HT receptors can exert effects in animal models of cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Larger, consistently designed studies are needed to understand the roles of 5-HT in cognition in healthy and depressed individuals.

To investigate the pathophysiology associated with the syndrome, we used a rat continuous stress (CS) model where the pituitary represents one of the most affected organs. Here we found that mRNA for VGF (non-acronymic), a member of the granin family, was induced specifically in the intermediate lobe (IL). This was matched by a concomitant increase at the peptide/protein level assessed by C-terminal antibody. Furthermore, the up-regulation of VGF was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in a subset of melanotrophs. VGF expression was altered in the IL of rats receivingthe dopamine D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine or the antagonist sulpiride. In vitro, dopamine dose-dependently decreased the mRNA levels in cultured melanotrophs.

The present study was designed to provide a systematic replication of prior behavioral, pharmacological, and neurochemical experiments. In particular, the ability of curcumin to engender anti-immobility effects in the mouse forced-swim assay was established. Although prior work had shown curcumin to function as an inhibitor of the monoamine metabolizing enzyme, monoamine oxidase (MAO), neither MAOA nor MAOB was inhibitied by curcumin in the present study. Curcumin had also been reported previously to function as a cannabinoid CB1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist. However, in our hands, curcumin did not potently alter GTP-Î³.-35S binding indicative of functional CB1 antagonism (Kb = 2080 nM). Moreover, curcumin was not able to prevent the hypothermic effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonist (-)-cis-3-[2-Hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol (CP 55,940). Nonetheless, the anti-immobility effects of curcumin did not occur in CB1 -/- mice. Finally, a broad array of protein receptors and enzymes were evaluated in vitro for their potential interaction with and/or functional engagement with curcumin. Of the more than 100 targets screened, curcumin had very low potency in most. Of those targets with appreciable activity, curcumin had affinities for the human cloned muscarinic receptor subtypes (Ki = 1.3-3.1 uM). Moreover, the plasma and brain levels of curcumin at behaviorally-active doses were below quantitative limits. Given these findings, it is concluded that the prominent antidepressant-like behavioral effects of curcumin, replicated here and in multiple acute and chronic rodent models detailed in the literature, are the result of as yet undisclosed mechanisms of action.

Using this preparation, we have examined receptor-mediated feedback modulation of DA metabolism in the graft and, separately, in its terminals in the host striatum. For this purpose we administered the DA receptor antagonist, haloperidol, and the DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO), systemically, and calculated the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios as an index of DA turnover in the graft itself as well as in the adjacent host striatum. A marked increase in dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios was seen after haloperidol treatment. This increase was found 1) within the solid transplant tissue itself as well as 2) within the transplant reinnervated regions of the host striatum. The net elevation in DA metabolites associated with the transplant terminals was less than that obtained in the intact striatum. APO significantly decreased the dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA and homovanillic acid/DA ratios in the transplant-innervated regions of the host striatum; this effect of APO was of a greater magnitude than that seen in intact controls. Within the solid transplant itself, APO caused slight but not significant decreases in DA metabolism.

These receptors are mediating the effects of 5-HT throughout different brain areas via projections originating from midbrain raphe nuclei. A growing interest has been focusing on the function of 5-HT2C receptors in the basal ganglia because they may be involved in various diseases of basal ganglia function notably those associated with chronic impairment of dopaminergic transmission. 5-HT2C receptors act on numerous types of neurons in the basal ganglia, including dopaminergic, GABAergic, glutamatergic or cholinergic cells. Perhaps inherent to their peculiar molecular properties, the modality of controls exerted by 5-HT2C receptors over these cell populations can be phasic, tonic (dependent on the 5-HT tone) or constitutive (a spontaneous activity without the presence of the ligand). These controls are functionally organized in the basal ganglia: they are mainly localized in the input structures and preferentially distributed in the limbic/associative territories of the basal ganglia. The nature of these controls is modified in neuropsychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease, tardive dyskinesia or addiction. Most of the available data indicate that the function of 5-HT2C receptor is enhanced in cases of chronic alterations of dopamine neurotransmission. The review illustrates that 5-HT2C receptors play a role in maintaining continuous controls over the basal ganglia via multiple diverse actions.

In vivo microdialysis was used to investigate IFN-Î± effects on DA release in the striatum. In addition, positron emission tomography (PET) with [(11)C]raclopride was used to examine IFN-Î±-induced changes in DA2 receptor (D2R) binding potential before and after intravenous amphetamine administration. DA transporter binding was measured by PET using [(18)F]2Î²-carbomethoxy-3Î²-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)nortropane.

In vivo microdialysis demonstrated decreased release of DA after 4 weeks of IFN-Î± administration compared with saline. PET neuroimaging also revealed decreased DA release after 4 weeks of IFN-Î± as evidenced by reduced displacement of [(11)C]raclopride following amphetamine administration. In addition, 4 weeks of IFN-Î± was associated with decreased D2R binding but no change in the DA transporter. Sucrose consumption was reduced during IFN-Î± administration and was correlated with decreased DA release at 4 weeks as measured by in vivo microdialysis.

Growing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggests that orexins (neuropeptides that are also known as hypocretins) and their receptors are involved in the physiopathology of depression. Indeed, the orexinergic system regulates functions that are disturbed in depressive states such as sleep, reward system, feeding behavior, the stress response and monoaminergic neurotransmission. Nevertheless, the precise role of orexins in behavioral and neurophysiological impairments observed in depression is still unclear. Both hypoactivity and hyperactivity of orexin signaling pathways have been found to be associated with depression. These discrepancies in the literature prompted the necessity for additional investigations, as the orexinergic system appears to be a promising target to treat the symptoms of depression. This assumption is underlined by recent data suggesting that pharmacological blockade of orexin receptors induces a robust antidepressant-like effect in an animal model of depression. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to progress the overall understanding of the orexinergic alterations in depression, which will eventually translate preliminary observations into real therapeutic potential.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The implication of the monoaminergic systems in the antidepressant-like activity of Aloysia gratissima was evaluated using different pharmacological antagonists that were administered previously to the acute oral administration of AE (10 mg/kg). The antidepressant-like effect was assessed in the TST and locomotor activity was evaluated in the open-field test in mice.

We investigated serotonergic modulation of anxiety-like behavior in adolescent (PN28-32) and adult (PN67-73) male rats using the SSRI fluoxetine, the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH DPAT, and the 5-HTâ‚‚ agonist mCPP. Acute treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) produced greater anxiogenic effects in adults than adolescents in the light/dark (LD) test for anxiety-like behavior, but fluoxetine (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased extracellular serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortex similarly in both ages. Adults were also more sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of 8-OH DPAT (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), but not mCPP (0.5 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.), in the LD test. Fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) stimulated greater increases in c-Fos expression across the extended amygdala in adults than in adolescents, and 8-OH DPAT (0.5 mg/kg) produced greater increases in c-Fos in the lateral orbital cortex and central nucleus of the amygdala in adults. These data show that lower anxiogenic effects of acute SSRIs in adolescents are associated with lesser activation of cortical and amygdala brain regions.

In the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG), another key panic-associated area, serotonin, through the activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, exerts an inhibitory role on escape expression. This panicolytic-like effect is facilitated by chronic treatment with clinically effective antipanic drugs such as fluoxetine and imipramine. It is still unclear whether serotonin within the DMH plays a similar regulatory action. The results showed that intra-DMH injection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI, but not the 5-HT2C agonist MK-212, inhibited the escape reaction of male Wistar rats evoked by electrical stimulation of the DMH. Local microinjection of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin was ineffective. Whereas chronic (21 days) systemic treatment with imipramine potentiated the anti-escape effect of both 8-OH-DPAT and DOI, repeated administration of fluoxetine enhanced the effect of the latter agonist. The results indicate that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors within the DMH play a phasic inhibitory role upon escape expression, as previously reported in the dPAG.

However, PD is a multi-systemic disease in which extra-dopaminergic systems are affected. The serotonergic (5-HT) system is one of these and has been extensively studied in PD. Although the 5-HT system uses one transporter (SERT) and 14 receptor sub-types, most of the studies in PD have focussed on SERT and serotonergic type 1A and 2A receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A). Post-mortem autoradiographic binding studies and in vivo imaging studies have suggested an involvement of the 5-HT system in PD-related anxiety, depression, psychosis and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia. Pre-clinical and clinical pharmacological studies have shown that SERT blockade might effectively alleviate depression and dyskinesia and, more recently, might exert disease-modifying effects. Enhancing the physiological activity of 5-HT1A receptors with 5-HT1A agonists might alleviate anxiety, dyskinesia and tremor, although a deleterious effect on the anti-parkinsonian efficacy of L-DOPA may ultimately limit the use of this class of compounds. Enhanced 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission has been associated with depression, dyskinesia, psychosis and tremor. The current article critically reviews studies assessing the SERT, as well as 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in idiopathic PD and animal models of PD, and discusses unmet challenges to effectively treat manifestations of PD using SERT antagonists, 5-HT1A agonists and 5-HT2A antagonists.",,Germany,2013,10.1007/s00221-013-3621-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23811734

There is evidence for an increased release of dopamine, a slight increase of dopamine D2 receptors and an increase of dopamine D2High receptors in schizophrenia, all possibly explaining the clinical supersensitivity to dopamine. The elevation in apparent D2High receptors in vivo in schizophrenia matches the elevation in D2High receptors in many animal models of psychosis. The increased amounts of D2High receptors in psychotic-like behavior in animals may result from a loss of control of D2 by various factors. These factors include the rate of phosphorylation and desensitization of D2 receptors by kinases, the attachment of arrestin to D2 receptors, internalization of D2 receptors, the rate of receptor de-phosphorylation, formation of D2 receptor dimers, and GTP regulation by various GTPases. While at present there are no statistically significant associations of any of these controlling factors and their genes with schizophrenia, investigation of D2High receptors in schizophrenia will require a new radioligand in order to selectively label D2High receptors in vivo in patients.

By contrast, cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid with a broad therapeutic profile, is generally presented as an example of a cannabinoid compound with no motor effects due to its poor affinity for the CB1 and the CB2 receptor, despite its activity at the TRPV1 receptor. However, recent evidence suggests that CBD may interact with the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor to produce some of its beneficial effects. This may enable CBD to directly influence motor activity through the well-demonstrated role of serotonergic transmission in the basal ganglia. We have investigated this issue in rats using three different pharmacological and neurochemical approaches. First, we compared the motor effects of various i.p. doses of CBD with the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; i.p.). Second, we investigated whether the motor effects of CBD are sensitive to 5-HT1A receptor blockade in comparison with CB1 receptor antagonism. Finally, we investigated whether CBD was able to potentiate the effect of a sub-effective dose of 8-OH-DPAT. Our results demonstrated that: (i) only high doses of CBD (>10Â mg/kg) altered motor behavior measured in a computer-aided actimeter; (ii) these alterations were restricted to vertical activity (rearing) with only modest changes in other parameters; (iii) similar effects were produced by 8-OH-DPAT (1Â mg/kg), although this agonist affected exclusively vertical activity, with no effects on other motor parameters, and it showed always more potency than CBD; (iv) the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (1Â mg/kg) and CBD (20Â mg/kg) on vertical activity were reversed by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (0.5Â mg/kg; i.p.); (v) the effects of CBD (20Â mg/kg) on vertical activity were not reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (0.1Â mg/kg; i.p.); (vi) the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on vertical activity was associated with an increase in serotonin content in the basal ganglia, a neurochemical change not produced by CBD (20Â mg/kg); and (vii) CBD at a dose of 20Â mg/kg was able to enhance motor effects of a sub-effective dose of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1Â mg/kg), producing the expected changes in serotonergic transmission in the basal ganglia. Collectively, these results suggest that CBD may influence motor activity, in particular vertical activity, and that this effect seems to be dependent on its ability to target the 5-HT1A receptor, a mechanism of action that has been proposed to account for its anti-emetic, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.",,England,2013,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2013.07.024,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","5-HIAA and 5-HT and 5-HT(1A) Receptors and 5-HT(1A) receptor and 5-hydroindolacetic acid and 8-OH-DPAT and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin and CB(1) receptor and CB(2) receptor and CBD and CBDA and Cannabidiol and DOPAC and GABA and L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and Motor effects and PPAR and Serotonin and TRPV1 and TRPV2 and Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 and Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 and Vertical activity and cannabidiol and cannabidiolic acid and cannabinoid type 1 receptor and cannabinoid type 2 receptor and peroxisome-proliferating activator receptor and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and serotonin type 1A receptor and <ce><94>;(9)-THC and <ce><94>;(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and <ce><b3>-aminobutiric acid",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23924692

The association and dissociation rates of binding are temperature dependent and fastest at 37 degrees C. Binding is enriched in crude microsomal (P3) membranes. D-[3H]LSD binding is stereospecific as L-LSD, the psychotropically inactive enatiomer, is 1000 times weaker than D-LSD as a displacing agent. The potencies of other LSD analogues parallel their psychotropic activity with the exception of 2-bromo-LSD (psychotropically inactive) which is as potent as D-LSD in displacing bound D-[3H]LSD. Serotonin is the only putative neurotransmitter with affinity (ED50 = 3 muM) for the LSD binding site, and psychotropically active alkylindoleamines are also potent displacing agents. Destruction of presynaptic serotonin neuronal elements by lesioning the midbrain raphe nuclei does not chang the affinity or maximum number of detectable in vitro D-[3H]LSD bindind sites. The regional distribution in monkey brain of D-[3H]LSD binding and high affinity [3h]serotonin uptake, a marker for pre-synaptic serotonin nerve terminal density, shows some correlation.

Carisbamate has shown antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression, and lamotrigine is a mood stabilizer with a therapeutic effect in depressive episodes of patients with bipolar disorder. This study examined the effects of carisbamate and lamotrigine on monoaminergic transmission in rodents, which could contribute to their antidepressant action. In vivo electrophysiological recordings were carried out in rats after 2 and 14 days administration of vehicle, carisbamate (60 mg/kg daily), or lamotrigine (25 mg/kg daily). Overall firing activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-HT), locus coeruleus norepinephrine, and ventral tegmental area dopamine (DA) neurons was decreased with carisbamate. Lamotrigine also decreased 5-HT neuronal firing, and this effect was abolished by lesion of the prefrontal cortex. Despite these decreases in firing activity after their prolonged administration, both anticonvulsants exhibited a significant increase in tonic activation of hippocampus 5-HT1A receptors, as shown by a disinhibition of the firing activity of pyramidal neurons in response to the selective antagonist WAY-100635 (N-{2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride). This finding reveals an increase in the 5-HT level that may be attributed to a desensitization of the terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptors. This study demonstrates that sustained carisbamate and lamotrigine administration decreases 5-HT firing in the DRN but nevertheless enhances 5-HT transmission in the forebrain. This serotonergic effect may be associated with an antiglutamatergic action and may contribute to the antidepressant-like effect of carisbamate in the forced swim test and the antidepressant properties of lamotrigine.",,United States,2013,10.1124/jpet.113.203315,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-23986541

METHODS: Clonogenic assay, incorporation of BrdU, cell cycle distribution, phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and cAMP production were evaluated in vitro. An experimental human melanoma model was developed into athymic nude mice. Tumor growth, survival and histochemical studies were performed in order to investigate the expression levels of H4R, HA, PCNA, mitotic index (MI), and angiogenesis. RESULTS: The results indicate that H4R agonists inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP levels only in M1/15 cells while increased phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 and decreased proliferation in both cell types. In vivo studies show that HA and CLZ (1mgkg(-1), sc) significantly increased median survival and decreased tumor volume. These effects were associated to a reduction in MI, in the expression of proliferation marker and in intratumoral neovascularization.

We show here that differentiated osteoblasts, like neurons, express the norepinephrine transporter (NET), exhibit specific NE uptake activity via NET and can catabolize, but not generate, NE. Pharmacological blockade of NE transport by reboxetine induced bone loss in WT mice. Similarly, lack of NE reuptake in norepinephrine transporter (Net)-deficient mice led to reduced bone formation and increased bone resorption, resulting in suboptimal peak bone mass and mechanical properties associated with low sympathetic outflow and high plasma NE levels. Last, daily sympathetic activation induced by mild chronic stress was unable to induce bone loss, unless NET activity was blocked. These findings indicate that the control of endogenous NE release and reuptake by presynaptic neurons and osteoblasts is an important component of the complex homeostatic machinery by which the sympathetic nervous system controls bone remodeling.

Although this property is well established, the post-synaptic mechanisms by which these pharmacological agents exert therapeutic activity in major depressive disorders (MDD) is not fully understood. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have indicated that the density and reactivity of glia and more particularly of astrocytes are reduced in MDD patients. These data along with the fact that astrocytes express monoaminergic transporters and receptors make these cells putative targets for antidepressant treatments. Accordingly, in vitro evidence has demonstrated that the application of various classes of antidepressant drugs on rodent primary astrocyte cultures elicits a wide spectrum of responses, from the rise in cytosolic calcium concentrations, as a marker of cellular activity, to the release of glucose metabolites, gliotransmitters and neurotrophic factors. Remarkably, antidepressant drugs also attenuate the release of inflammatory molecules from reactive astrocytes or microglia, suggesting that part of the beneficial effects in depressed patients or animal models of depression might result from the ability of antidepressants to regulate the synthesis and release of psychoactive substances acting on both pre- and post-synaptic neurons. Among the many long-term targets of antidepressant drugs, brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been well studied because of the positive influence on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptogenesis and the local serotonergic tone. This review will illustrate how the concept of the tripartite synapse, which is classically associated with different forms of plasticity involving glutamate, could be expanded to the monoaminergic systems to regulate antidepressant drug responses. The recent in vivo data supporting that hippocampal astrocytes act in concert with neurons to release BDNF under pharmacological conditions and thereby regulate different facets of anxiolytic-/antidepressant-like activities through neurogenesis-dependent and independent mechanisms will be emphasized.",,United Arab Emirates,2013,10.2174/13894501113149990209,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24020973

In rats, these drugs induce a behavioral syndrome (characterized by hyperlocomotion and stereotypies), an enhanced glutamatergic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, and damage to retrosplenial cortical neurons in adult rats, which was measured as the induction of the stress protein 72/73 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp72/73). In the present work, we have examined the existence of possible differences among different antipsychotic drugs in their capacity to block immunolabeling of Hsp72/73 in the retrosplenial cortex of the rat induced by the potent NMDA receptor antagonist, MK- 801. In addition, the effects of selective monoaminergic agents were also studied to delineate the particular receptors responsible for the actions of antipsychotic drugs.

Cognitive dysfunction and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia are believed to result from hypofunction of the mesocortical dopaminergic projections to prefrontal cortex (PFC). Noradrenergic targets for the augmentation of dopaminergic function in PFC show promise to improve cognitive deficits as well as negative symptoms. Serotonergic targets for the modulation of mesocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission include 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors. The hallmark of Parkinson's disease is the destruction of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. l-DOPA, a metabolic precursor of dopamine, is the standard of treatment. However, the ectopic release of dopamine (DA) from serotonin neurons and the clearance of extracellular DA by the norepinephrine transporter in areas enriched with noradrenergic terminals contribute to extracellular DA produced by l-DOPA and offer opportunities to improve l-DOPA therapy. The high-affinity transporters for monoamines are the primary targets for antidepressant drugs. However, many patients experience suboptimal therapeutic benefit or fail to respond to treatment. Organic cation transporters and plasma membrane monoamine transporter serve an important function in regulating monoamine neurotransmission and hold potential utility as targets for the development of therapeutic drugs. Improved therapeutic approaches will arise from not only understanding how monoamines influence one another within the central nervous system as an integrated whole but also addressing the pathophysiology of specific core symptoms or distinct syndromal dimensions (cognitive impairment, motor slowing, and negative affect) regardless of disease classification, for example, psychotic, affective, and neurodegenerative.",,United States,2013,10.1016/B978-0-12-411512-5.00009-9,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",Depression and Organic cation transporter and Parkinson<e2><80><99>s disease and Plasma membrane monoamine transporter and Schizophrenia and Serotonin and l-DOPA,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24054145

The loss of Ca(2+) homeostasis is associated with many neurological diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and schizophrenia. We investigated the mechanisms involved in intracellular Ca(2+) signaling in PC-12 cells. The stimulation of NGF-differentiated PC-12 cells with 3Î¼M ATP caused an early Ca(2+) release followed by a delayed Ca(2+) release. The delayed Ca(2+) release was dependent on prior ATP priming and on dopamine secretion by PC-12 cells. Delayed Ca(2+) release was abolished in the presence of spiperone, suggesting that it is due to the activation of D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) by dopamine secreted by PC-12 cells. This was shown to be independent of PKA activation but dependent on PLC activity. An endocytosis step was required for inducing the delayed Ca(2+) release. Given the importance of calcyon in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we verified the role of this protein in the delayed Ca(2+) release phenomenon. siRNA targeting of calcyon blocked the delayed Ca(2+) release, decreased ATP-evoked IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) release, and impaired subsequent Ca(2+) oscillations. Our results suggested that calcyon is involved in an unknown mechanism that causes a delayed IP3R-mediated Ca(2+) release in PC-12 cells. In schizophrenia, Ca(2+) dysregulation may depend on the upregulation of calcyon, which maintains elevated Ca(2+) levels as well as dopamine signaling.",,England,2013,10.1016/j.cellsig.2013.08.021,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","50% effective concentration and Bont X F and CaMKII and Calcium and Calcyon and DMSO and DR and Dopamine and EC50 and G protein coupled receptor and GPCR and IP(3) and IP(3) receptor and IP(3)R and PC-12 cells and PKA and PLC and ROCE and SERCA and SOCE and botulinum toxin type F and calmodulin kinase II and dimethylsulfoxid and dopamine receptor and inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate receptor and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and phospholipase C and protein kinase A and receptor-operated Ca(2+) entry and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase and store-operated Ca(2+) entry",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24055909

The haloperidol-induced catalepsy is a state of akinesia and rigidity very similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. There exists great interest in knowing whether or not some degree of emotionality underlies catalepsy. If so, what kind of emotional distress would permeate such motor disturbance? This study is an attempt to shed some light on this issue through an analysis of ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) of 22 kHz, open-field test, and contextual conditioned fear in rats with some degree of catalepsy induced by haloperidol. Systemic administration of haloperidol caused catalepsy and decreased exploratory activity in the open-field. There was no difference in the emission of USVs between groups during the catalepsy or the exploratory behavior in the open-field test. In the contextual conditioned fear, when administered before training session, haloperidol did not change the emission of USVs or the freezing response. When administered before testing session, haloperidol enhanced the freezing response and decreased the emission of USVs on the test day. These findings suggest that the involvement of dopaminergic mechanisms in threatening situations depends on the nature of the aversive stimulus. Activation of D2 receptors occurs in the setting up of adaptive responses to conditioned fear stimuli so that these mechanisms seem to be important for the emission of 22 kHz USVs during the testing phase of the contextual conditioned fear, but not during the training session or the open-field test (unconditioned fear stimuli). Catalepsy, on the other hand, is the result of the blockage of D2 receptors in neural circuits associated to motor behavior that appears to be dissociated from those directly linked to dopamine-mediated neural mechanisms associated to fear.",,Netherlands,2013,10.1016/j.bbr.2013.10.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Catalepsy and Conditioned fear and Haloperidol and Open-field and Ultrasound vocalization,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24120401

Valproate is used worldwide for the treatment of epilepsy, as a mood stabiliser and for its pain-relieving properties. In addition to birth defects, FVS is associated with an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which is characterised by abnormal behaviours. Valproate perturbs multiple biochemical pathways and alters gene expression through its inhibition of histone deacetylases. Which, if any, of these mechanisms is relevant to the genesis of its behavioural side effects is unclear. Neuroanatomical changes associated with FVS have been reported and, among these, altered serotonergic neuronal differentiation is a consistent finding. Altered serotonin homeostasis is also associated with autism. Here we have used a chemical-genetics approach to investigate the underlying molecular defect in a zebrafish FVS model. Valproate causes the selective failure of zebrafish central serotonin expression. It does so by downregulating the proneural gene ascl1b, an ortholog of mammalian Ascl1, which is a known determinant of serotonergic identity in the mammalian brainstem. ascl1b is sufficient to rescue serotonin expression in valproate-treated embryos. Chemical and genetic blockade of the histone deacetylase Hdac1 downregulates ascl1b, consistent with the Hdac1-mediated silencing of ascl1b expression by valproate. Moreover, tonic Notch signalling is crucial for ascl1b repression by valproate. Concomitant blockade of Notch signalling restores ascl1b expression and serotonin expression in both valproate-exposed and hdac1 mutant embryos. Together, these data provide a molecular explanation for serotonergic defects in FVS and highlight an epigenetic mechanism for genome-environment interaction in disease.",,England,2014,10.1242/dmm.013219,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Fetal valproate syndrome and Hdac1 and Notch and Proneural gene and Serotonin and Zebrafish,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24135485

In addition to the cerebral dopaminergic (DA) system, the serotoninergic (5-HT) system also plays a crucial role in regulating psychoemotional, cognitive and motor functions in the central nervous system (CNS). Among the large 5-HT receptor family, accumulating data have revealed new insights into the therapeutic benefit of the 5-HT1A receptor in treating various CNS disorders, especially schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. The present review discusses the advance of dual agents with mixed actions at the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in the treatment of these diseases. Aripiprazole was the only marketed drug with dual D2 and 5-HT1A profile. It is a partial D2 and 5-HT1A receptor agonist and has been prescribed as an atypical antipsychotical drug. Two other drugs Cariprazine and Pardoprunox are being investigated in clinic. Most of the other candidate compounds, including Bifeprunox, Sarizotan, Mazapertine succinate, PF-217830, and Adoprazine were discontinued due to either non-optimal pharmacokinetic properties or insufficient therapeutical efficacy. Although much effort has been done to highlight the advantages of the 5-HT1A and D2 dual approach, it has to be pointed out that many of these drugs showed poly-pharmacological profile by targeting many other receptors and/or transporters besides the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. In this regard, 'pure' compounds exclusively acting on the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors are highly needed to further validate this approach.

During the course of diabetes, progressive decreases in the activity of TH and a marked increase in the concentration of norepinephrine were observed in several brain regions, including thalamus, hypothalamus, medulla and midbrain. This inverse relationship between TH activity and norepinephrine content was also seen in the pons but only in the 90-day diabetic animals. Lower TH activity in the hypothalamus of 30-day diabetic rats reflected a decreased Vmax, but no difference in the Km. The number of alpha adrenergic receptors was increased significantly in the hypothalamus, medulla and midbrain of the 30-day diabetic rats. The concentrations of dopamine and serotonin in various brain regions of the 10- and 30-day diabetic rats were generally not significantly different from controls. Concentrations of the acidic metabolites of these neurotransmitters, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, were, however, greatly reduced.

The predictability of its clinical effectiveness in psychoneuroses is very high, and important quantitative and qualitative differences between compounds in this chemical class can be shown using such a behavioral technique. It is important to take these differences into account when studying biochemical correlates or mechanisms of action within the benzodiazepine class. Conflict behavior has been used to evaluate several biochemical hypotheses concerning the mechanism of action for the antianxiety properties of benzodiazepines. These studies found that inhibition of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase did not seem to be a relevant factor. Similarly, experiments with AOAA did not provide evidence to support the involvement of GABA with benzodiazepines' antianxiety properties, nor did glycine receptor affinities correlate significantly with anticonflict effects. Thus, while it is reasonable at present to associate either GABA or glycine with the muscle-relaxant or anticonvulsant properties of benzodiazepines, no support was provided in the conflict procedure for their involvement in the anxiolytic effects. Partial support was provided for the proposal that serotonin is involved in the benzodiazepines' anxiolytic activity.

EST-drug interactions were observed with each of these drugs on one or more monoaminergic systems. All interactions were antagonistic in nature. Changes in the CSF levels of monoamine metabolites did not always reflect corresponding changes in the monoamine turnover; the increase in 5HIAA seen after chronic Li was due to slower removal of this metabolite from the CSF. However, the changes in the CSF levels of DA and 5HT metabolites following chronic HLDL reflected changes in the turnover of the parent amine in the brain. The effects of both HLDL and EST on DA metabolism in the intact brain could be related to alterations by these treatments of the responsiveness of DA presynaptic receptors. Similarly, the effect of HLDL on 5HT turnover and the antagonistic interaction of EST on this HLDL-induced effect were associated with changes in 3H-IMI binding sites that label the 5HT transporter in serotonergic presynaptic terminals. The results are discussed with the aid of a model that depicts possible relationships between pre- and postsynaptic variables and their influence on each other. According to this model an increase in the neurotransmitter turnover is associated with ""down regulation"" of both pre- and postsynaptic receptors whereas a decrease in turnover is associated with receptor ""up regulation."" However, ""up regulation"" of receptors is not necessarily associated with augmented postsynaptic response. Analysis of the model variables by the ""binding equation"" which obeys the Clark occupancy principle revealed that receptor ""up regulation"" which is associated with decreased turnover may result in either an augmented or a depressed postsynaptic response (related to the number of occupied receptors). The direction of the response depends on the ratio between the rate of receptor ""up regulation"" and the rate of decrease in neurotransmitter turnover.",,United States,1986,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1986.tb51249.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2423001

Regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between brain TRP and the percentage of plasma TRP which was free (i.e. unbound to albumin), both increased by FA injection. The increase in brain TRP promoted an increased brain serotonin synthesis, as measured by the enhanced brain and CSF 5-HIAA levels. Valine pretreatment, which blocks TRP entry into the brain, completely prevented FA-induced brain TRP and brain 5-HIAA increases. These results suggest that the increased brain serotonergic turnover following FA treatment was due to a peripheral action of the drug upon TRP disposition. The latter effect may be caused (i) by in vivo peripheral alterations in catecholaminergic metabolism and (ii) by FA chemical structure since in vitro experiments revealed that FA was able to displace TRP binding to albumin, thus increasing the plasma free TRP pool.",,Austria,1986,10.1007/BF01249084,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2423643

It was found that in all cases where drugs reduced 3H-haloperidol binding to striatal D2-receptors ex vivo (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, clozapine, fluperlapine, pizotifen, zimelidine), the same drugs caused a pronounced increase, in vivo, in the striatal HVA-concentration, i.e. an increase in DA-turnover. The HVA-increase was directly proportional to the extent of the reduction of 3H-haloperidol binding. These findings suggested that in the 3H-haloperidol assay binding of drugs is to functional D2-receptors regulating the release of DA. In contrast, reduction of binding of 3H-prazosin to brain stem alpha 1-receptors ex vivo (all drugs except zimelidine) was only associated with an in vivo increase in the MOPEG-SO4 concentration in some cases (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, thioridazine, clozapine, fluperlapine, ketanserine). Similarly, reduction of 3H-spiperone binding to 5-HT2-receptors in the frontal cortex (all agents except prazosin and zimelidine) was only associated with an increase in the 5-HIAA concentration in certain cases (thioridazine, clozapine, fluperlapine, pizotifen, ketanserin).

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether mPFC DA hypofunction following social stress is specific to adolescent experience and if this results from stress-induced DA D2 receptor activation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male rats exposed to repeated social defeat during adolescence or adulthood had mPFC DA activity sampled 17 days later. Separate experiments used freely moving microdialysis to measure mPFC DA release in response to adolescent defeat exposure. At P40, 49 and 56 mPFC DA turnover was assessed to identify when DA activity decreased in relation to the adolescent defeat experience. Finally, nondefeated adolescent rats received repeated intra-mPFC infusions of the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole, while another adolescent group received intra-mPFC infusions of the D2 antagonist amisulpride before defeat exposure. RESULTS: Long-term decreases or increases in mPFC DA turnover were observed following adolescent or adult defeat, respectively. Adolescent defeat exposure elicits sustained increases in mPFC DA release, and DA turnover remains elevated beyond the stress experience before declining to levels below normal at P56. Activation of mPFC D2 receptors in nondefeated adolescents decreases DA activity in a similar manner to that caused by adolescent defeat, while defeat-induced reductions in mPFC DA activity are prevented by D2 receptor blockade. CONCLUSIONS: Both the developing and mature PFC DA systems are vulnerable to social stress, but only adolescent defeat causes DA hypofunction.

Although 14-3-3Î¶ is proposed to modulate activity of the rate-limiting DA biosynthesis enzyme, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), we were unable to identify any differences in total TH levels, TH localization or TH activation in 14-3-3Î¶ KO mice. Rather, our analysis identified significantly reduced levels of DAT in the absence of notable differences in RNA or protein levels of DA receptors D1-D5. Providing insight into the mechanisms by which 14-3-3Î¶ controls DAT stability, we found a physical association between 14-3-3Î¶ and DAT by co-immunoprecipitation. Taken together, our results identify a novel role for 14-3-3Î¶ in DA neurotransmission and provide support to the hyperdopaminergic basis of pathologies associated with schizophrenia and related disorders.",,United States,2013,10.1038/tp.2013.99,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24301645

We demonstrate here that the metastatic mammary adenocarcinoma cell line 4T1 does not express functional adrenergic receptors (AR), the receptors activated by norepinephrine, yet stimulation of adrenergic receptor in vivo altered 4T1 tumor progression in vivo. Chronic treatment with the antidepressant desipramine (DMI) to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake increased 4T1 tumor growth but not metastasis. Treatment with a highly selective Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine (DEX), increased tumor growth and metastasis. Neither isoproterenol (ISO), a Î²-AR agonist, nor phenylephrine, an Î±1-AR agonist, altered tumor growth or metastasis. Neither DMI- nor DEX-induced tumor growth was associated with increased angiogenesis. In DMI-treated mice, tumor VEGF, IL-6, and the prometastatic chemokines RANTES, M-CSF, and MIP-2 were reduced. Tumor collagen microstructure was examined using second harmonic generation (SHG), a nonabsorptive optical scattering process to highlight fibrillar collagen. In DMI- and DEX-treated mice, but not ISO-treated mice, tumor SHG was significantly altered without changing fibrillar collagen content, as detected by immunofluorescence. These results demonstrate that Î±2-AR activation can promote tumor progression in the absence of direct sympathetic input to breast tumor cells. The results also suggest that SNS activation may regulate tumor progression through alterations in the extracellular matrix, with outcome dependent on the combination of adrenergic receptor activated. These results underscore the complexities underlying SNS regulation of breast tumor pathogenesis, and suggest that the therapeutic use of adrenergic receptor blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and adrenergic receptor agonists must be approached cautiously in patients with breast cancer.",,United States,2013,10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-13-0079,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24309563

Dopamine system dysfunction is strongly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia. Data support the long-standing concept of schizophrenia as a disease characterized by hyperactivity within midbrain (striatal D2) dopamine systems. In addition, there is now considerable evidence that glutamate neurotransmission, mediated through NMDA-type receptors, is deficient in schizophrenic patients and that hypoactivity in cortical dopamine and glutamate pathways is a key feature of the schizophrenic brain. While current antipsychotic medications-typically dopamine D2 antagonists-adequately address positive symptoms of the disease, such as the acute hallucinations and delusions, they fail to substantially improve negative features, such as social isolation, and can further compromise poor cognitive function in schizophrenic patients. In fact, cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia. The treatment of cognitive impairment and other residual symptoms associated with schizophrenia, therefore, remains a significant unmet medical need. With current cell-surface receptor-based pharmacology falling short of addressing these core symptoms associated with schizophrenia, more recent approaches to treatment development have focused on processes within the cell. In this review, we discuss the importance of a number of intracellular targets, including cyclic nucleotide phosphodiestereases, and non-phosphodiesterase approaches such as ITI-007, which have been proposed to regulate hyperdopaminergic function, hypoglutamatergic function and/or the delicate balance of the two associated with cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. We also discuss the challenge facing those developing drugs to target specific pathways involved in psychopathology without involving other systems that produce concomitant side effects.",,United Arab Emirates,2014,10.2174/1381612819666131216115417,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24345266

As such, there is a continued search for more viable novel drug targets. Engaging in cognitive behaviors is associated with distinct coordinated oscillatory activity across brain regions, in particular the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. In schizophrenia patients, pathological alterations in the functionality of GABAergic interneurons in the PFC and HPC responsible for generating network oscillations are thought to contribute to impaired cognition. Destabilized GABAergic interneuron activity in the HPC is further associated with aberrant increases in HPC output and enhanced dopamine neuron activity. Consequently, drugs directed at restoring HPC function could impact both oscillatory activity along with dopamine tone. There is compelling evidence from animal models of schizophrenia that allosteric modulation of the Î±5 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is a viable means of resolving aberrant dopamine system activity through indirect alteration of HPC output. Consequently, these compounds are promising for their potential in also ameliorating cognitive deficits attributed to dysfunction in HPC network activity.",,United Arab Emirates,2014,10.2174/1381612819666131216114612,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24345268

The 5-HT motor syndrome was used as an index of in vivo serotonergic function. In vitro, 3H-5-HT uptake, potassium-evoked 3H-5-HT release and 5-HT autoreceptor activity were evaluated as measures of presynaptic function. Repeated injections of NMD abolished the 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT)-induced motor syndrome and the ability of 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MEOT) to attenuate the potassium-evoked release of 3H-5HT. Autoreceptor subsensitivity was associated with a marked increase in basal and potassium-evoked 3H-5-HT release. In contrast, acute NMD, and acute and chronic CMI did not affect the expression of the motor syndrome or alter 3H-HT release or autoreceptor activity. Acute and chronic injections of NMD enhanced 3H-5-HT uptake. The results suggest that the antidepressant efficacy of monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) antidepressants may be related to their ability to increase endogenous levels of 5-HT and thereby produce a subsensitivity of 5-HT1 type receptors. This subsensitivity is reflected both by attenuation of the motor syndrome and enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission resulting in part from autoreceptor down-regulation.",,United States,1987,10.1016/0091-3057(87)90171-7,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2437597

However, before new research can focus on potential treatments that work by manipulating the endocannabinoid system, it needs to be elucidated how this system is involved in symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we review human studies that investigated acute effects of cannabis or âˆ†9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain functions that are implicated in schizophrenia. Results suggest that the impact of THC administration depends on the difficulty of the task performed. Impaired performance of cognitive paradigms is reported on more challenging tasks, which is associated with both activity deficits in temporal and prefrontal areas and a failure to deactivate regions of the default mode network. Comparable reductions in prefrontal activity and impairments in deactivation of the default mode network are seen in patients during performance of cognitive paradigms. Normal performance levels after THC administration demonstrated for less demanding tasks are shown to be related to either increased neural effort in task-specific regions ('neurophysiological inefficiency'), or recruitment of alternative brain areas, which suggests a change in strategy to meet cognitive demands. Particularly a pattern of performance and brain activity corresponding with an inefficient working memory system is consistently demonstrated in patients. These similarities in brain function between intoxicated healthy volunteers and schizophrenia patients provide an argument for a role of the endocannabinoid system in symptoms of schizophrenia, and further emphasize this system as a potential novel target for treatment of these symptoms.",,England,2014,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2013.11.017,Journal Article and Review,Cannabis and Cognition and Endocannabinoid system and Neuroimaging and Schizophrenia and <e2><88><86>9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24380726

In the present study, we examined the effect of the Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist 2, 3-dioxo-6-nitro-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) on encounter-induced behavioural and neurochemical changes to study the role of the receptor in abnormal behaviours in isolation-reared mice. The encounter to an intruder mouse induced hyperactivity with transient increases in prefrontal dopamine and serotonin levels in isolation-reared mice. NBQX attenuated the encounter-induced hyperactivity and the associated neurochemical changes in isolation-reared mice. In addition, NBQX reduced aggressive behaviour and cognitive impairment in isolation-reared mice, but did not affect depressive-like behaviour or spontaneous hyper-locomotion in these animals. The AMPA receptor agonist (S)-AMPA increased prefrontal dopamine and serotonin release, and this effect was higher in isolation-reared mice than in the group-reared mice, suggesting higher prefrontal AMPA receptor activity in isolation-reared mice. Furthermore, isolation rearing increased the expression of AMPA receptor subunits (GluR1, GluR2 and GluR3) and GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the hippocampus or nucleus accumbens. Taken together, these results suggest that an increase in AMPA receptor activity in the prefrontal cortex contributes to some, but not all, abnormal behaviours in isolation-reared mice.",,England,2014,10.1017/S1461145713001582,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24405605

We investigated the functional role of rare genetic variants in DRD4 which may have implications for translational medicine. CHO-K1 cells independently expressing four rare non-synonymous variants of DRD4 namely R237L, A281P, S284G located in the third cytosolic loop and V194G, located in the fifth transmembrane domain were generated.

Here the hypothesis that synaptic plasticity, specifically long term depression, is the neural substrate that mediates adolescent synaptic pruning is re-examined in the context of its ramifications for neuropsychiatric illnesses. Stress, which in part is mediated by dopamine acting via the D1 receptor, may disrupt normal synaptic plasticity in adolescence resulting in excessive synaptic elimination. In this manner elevated dopamine levels due to stress could contribute to deficits in gray matter volume and reduced neural connectivity in diseases such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, another developmental illness associated with cortical gray matter volume deficits, may represent a state of diminished dopamine stimulation that is equally disruptive to normal mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. In post-traumatic stress disorder, long term potentiation necessary for conditioned fear extinction, is thought to be impaired. Recent evidence suggests that genotypes related to dopamine neurotransmission confer vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder, perhaps indicating that low dopamine levels are less permissive of the synaptic plasticity that underlies consolidation and retention of fear extinction. Further understanding of the role that dopamine-modulated synaptic plasticity plays in development and, when disrupted, in precipitating neuropsychiatric illness could lead to novel drug treatments, and ultimately to preventative pharmacotherapeutic interventions, for these disorders.",,United Arab Emirates,2014,10.2174/1381612819666140110122307,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24410560

Administration of hydralazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) transiently, but significantly suppressed the seizures elicited by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). The suppressive actions were potentiated in the animals pretreated with either reserpine or p-chlorophenylalanine, but not alpha-methyltyrosine. Methysergide, an antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, could abolish the effect of hydralazine on the tonic component of the seizures, but unlikely that on the clonic one. Although 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the brain were both significantly increased after the administration of hydralazine, the increased levels of 5-HIAA reached the peak level earlier than those of 5-HT did. In 5-HT turnover, hydralazine did not change the 5-HT synthesis rate, but the drug inhibited the elimination of 5-HIAA from the brain. The accumulation of 5-HIAA after the inhibition of the acid transport system by probenecid was transiently, but significantly increased in the animals treated with hydralazine. The potency of the suppressive effects of hydralazine on PTZ-induced seizures was in parallel with the rate of 5-HIAA formation in the brain.

This study investigates the topographical distribution of the 5-HT4(a)-receptor in the juvenile rat brain and spinal cord, which is important for neuromodulation of cellular excitability and could be involved in various developmental processes of the central nervous system. We analysed the 5-HT4(a)-receptor at protein level with a monospecific polyclonal antibody by using an immunohistochemical staining. We saw an intensive staining in some areas of the cortex, in the olfactory bulb, in most areas of the cerebellum, in hippocampal areas like the dentate gyrus and in several different areas of the brainstem, especially in the motor nuclei. Overall we have shown comparable results in accordance with the results of other studies investigating the distribution of 5-HT4(a)-receptors. Some areas like the islands of Calleja, the preoptic nucleus or the medial habenular nucleus showed a lower intensity of 5-HT4(a)-receptors in comparison with the results of other studies.

The selective MAO-A inhibitor chlorgyline produced a more pronounced reduction of 5-HTOL than of 5-HIAA, while the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl was without effect on both serotonin metabolites. The MAO-A inhibitor amiflamine which is selective for serotonin neurons, was also more effective in reducing free 5-HTOL levels than of 5-HIAA levels, suggesting that the formation of 5-HTOL is closely associated with serotonin neurons. Neonatal treatment with the serotonin neurotoxin 5, 7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-HT) led to a more pronounced reduction of 5-HTOL levels in cerebral cortex than that of 5-HIAA levels, while the increase of 5-HTOL levels in pons-medulla was more marked than of 5-HIAA levels.

OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated the role of the dopaminergic innervations of the PL and IL in the modulation of Pavlovian appetitive cue and place conditioning, previously shown to be dependent on the basolateral amygdala and hippocampus, respectively. METHODS: Rats received preconditioning microinfusions of D-amphetamine, cis-flupenthixol, or vehicle solution directly into the PL or IL and were trained to simultaneously acquire conditioned cue and place preference in a radial maze. RESULTS: Preconditioning blockade of dopamine neurotransmission in the PL and amphetamine microinfusions in the IL had the same effect of attenuating place conditioning. In contrast, place conditioning remained intact following preconditioning amphetamine microinfusions in the PL and dopamine receptor blockade in the IL. Instead, conditioned cue preference was attenuated following IL dopamine receptor blockade. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that PL dopaminergic mechanisms are critical for the acquisition of appetitive place learning, while IL dopamine may oppose the influence of PL dopamine upon hippocampal-dependent learning. Furthermore, they implicate a functional reciprocity between mPFC and associated subregions of the nucleus accumbens in the regulation of limbic information processing.",,Germany,2014,10.1007/s00213-013-3414-0,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24429871

Cocaine also elevates dopamine levels in the hippocampus, a structure involved in contextual conditioning as well as in reward function. Hippocampal dopamine promotes the late phase of consolidation of an aversive step-down avoidance memory. Here, we examined the role of hippocampal dopamine function in the persistence of the conditioned increase in preference for a cocaine-associated compartment. Blocking dorsal hippocampal D1-type receptors (D1Rs) but not D2-type receptors (D2Rs) 12 h after a single training trial extended persistence of the normally short-lived memory; conversely, a general and a specific phospholipase C-coupled D1R agonist (but not a D2R or adenylyl cyclase-coupled D1R agonist) decreased the persistence of the normally long-lived memory established by three-trial training. These effects of D1 agents were opposite to those previously established in a step-down avoidance task, and were here also found to be opposite to those in a lithium chloride-conditioned avoidance task. After returning to normal following cocaine injection, dopamine levels in the dorsal hippocampus were found elevated again at the time when dopamine antagonists and agonists were effective: between 13 and 17 h after cocaine injection. These findings confirm that, long after the making of a cocaine-place association, hippocampal activity modulates memory consolidation for that association via a dopamine-dependent mechanism. They suggest a dynamic role for dorsal hippocampal dopamine in this late-phase memory consolidation and, unexpectedly, differential roles for late consolidation of memories for places that induce approach or withdrawal because of a drug association.",,England,2014,10.1038/npp.2014.11,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24442095

The etiology of LID is not clear; however, studies have shown that the dopamine D3 receptor is upregulated in the basal ganglia of mice, rats and non-human primate models of LID. It is not known if the upregulation of D3 receptor is a cause or result of LID. In this paper we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of the dopamine D3 receptor in dorsal striatum, in the absence of dopamine depletion, will elicit LID. Replication-deficient recombinant adeno-associated virus-2 expressing the D3 receptor or enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were stereotaxically injected, unilaterally, into the dorsal striatum of adult rats. Post-hoc immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ectopic expression of the D3 receptor was limited to neurons near the injection sites in the dorsal striatum. Following a 3-week recovery period, rats were administered saline, 6 mg/kg L-DOPA, 0.1 mg/kg PD128907 or 10 mg/kg ES609, i.p., and motor behaviors scored. Rats overexpressing the D3 receptor specifically exhibited contralateral axial abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) following administration of L-DOPA and PD128907 but not saline or the novel agonist ES609. Daily injection of 6 mg/kg L-DOPA to the rats overexpressing the D3 receptor also caused increased vacuous chewing behavior. These results suggest that overexpression of the D3 receptor in the dorsal striatum results in the acute expression of agonist-induced axial AIMs and chronic L-DOPA-induced vacuous chewing behavior. Agonists such as ES609 might provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat dyskinesia.",,Netherlands,2014,10.1016/j.bbr.2014.01.011,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Video-Audio Media",Adeno-associated virus and Dopamine receptor agonist and Levodopa-induced dyskinesia and Parkinson's disease and Tolerance,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24462727

After chronic depletion of serotonin with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (DHT, 200 micrograms/rat, intracisternally), initial intake of a mild isoleucine-imbalanced diet was reduced by 60% vs. a 17% reduction after saline injection. After acute treatment with the agonist, quipazine (quip, 5 mg/kg ip) or the precursor, tryptophan (TRP, 1% added to the diet), imbalanced diet intake was also exacerbated. PCPA and DHT may have caused receptor supersensitivity, such that the food intake depression after serotonin depletion was similar to that seen with the quip and TRP treatments. Injection of the autoreceptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 500 micrograms/kg sc), to reduce transmission in the serotonergic systems resulted in an attenuation of the usual food intake depression of the amino acid-imbalanced diet (only a 7%, nonsignificant reduction). Also measurements made in the absence of pharmacological treatment showed that the ratio 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid-to-serotonin, a putative index of serotonin turnover, was increased 155% in the raphe nuclei and 140% in the hippocampus 3.5 h after ingestion of the mild isoleucine-imbalanced diet. Therefore increased serotonergic activity in some brain areas may be associated with the initial depression of food intake in rats fed an imbalanced amino acid diet.",,United States,1987,10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.5.R763,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2446514

The 5-HT2A receptor is a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) expressed on many cell types, and a known therapeutic target for many disease states. This serotonin receptor is also known to regulate platelet function. Thus, in our FDA-approved drug repurposing efforts, we investigated the antiplatelet activity of cyproheptadine and pizotifen, two antidepressant 5-HT2A Receptor antagonists. Our results revealed that cyproheptadine and pizotifen reversed serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced platelet aggregation in vitro and ex vivo. And the inhibitory effects of these two agents were found to be similar to that of EMD 281014, a 5-HT2A Receptor antagonist under development. In separate experiments, our studies revealed that these 5-HT2A receptor antagonists have the capacity to reduce serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced elevation in intracellular calcium levels and tyrosine phosphorylation. Using flow cytometry, we also observed that cyproheptadine, pizotifen, and EMD 281014 inhibited serotonin-enhanced ADP-induced phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, P-selectin expression, and glycoprotein IIb-IIIa activation. Furthermore, using a carotid artery thrombosis model, these agents prolonged the time for thrombotic occlusion in mice in vivo. Finally, the tail-bleeding time was investigated to assess the effect of cyproheptadine and pizotifen on hemostasis. Our findings indicated prolonged bleeding time in both cyproheptadine- and pizotifen-treated mice. Notably, the increases in occlusion and bleeding times associated with these two agents were comparable to that of EMD 281014, and to clopidogrel, a commonly used antiplatelet drug, again, in a fashion comparable to clopidogrel and EMD 281014. Collectively, our data indicate that the antidepressant 5-HT2A antagonists, cyproheptadine and pizotifen do exert antiplatelet and thromboprotective effects, but similar to clopidogrel and EMD 281014, their use may interfere with normal hemostasis.",,United States,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0087026,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24466319

Although aripiprazole is now widely used for this indication, and much is known about its receptor-binding properties, the mechanism of its antidepressant augmentation remains ill-defined. In vivo animal studies and in vitro human studies using cloned dopamine dopamine D2 receptors suggest aripiprazole is a partial dopamine agonist; in this preliminary neuroimaging trial, we hypothesized that aripiprazole's antidepressant augmentation efficacy arises from dopamine partial agonist activity. To test this, we assessed the effects of aripiprazole augmentation on the cerebral utilization of 6-[(18)F]-fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (FDOPA) using positron emission tomography (PET). Fourteen depressed patients, who had failed 8 weeks of antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, underwent FDOPA PET scans before and after aripiprazole augmentation; 11 responded to augmentation. Whole brain, voxel-wise comparisons of pre- and post-aripiprazole scans revealed increased FDOPA trapping in the right medial caudate of augmentation responders. An exploratory analysis of depressive symptoms revealed that responders experienced large improvements only in putatively dopaminergic symptoms of lassitude and inability to feel.

However, the fundamental process(es) associated with this disease remain(s) uncertain. Many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is associated with excessive stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the associative striatum, with a lack of stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors in prefrontal cortex, and with modifications in prefrontal neuronal connectivity involving glutamate transmission at N-methyl aspartate (NMDA) receptors. This article, whilst briefly discussing the current knowledge of the disease, mainly concentrates on the NMDA hypofunction hypothesis. However, there are also potential consequences for a Dopamine imbalance on NMDA function.

3855e7ff-a892-4664-9c93-490f9a834aba,Is elevated norepinephrine an etiological factor in some cases of Parkinson's disease?,Fitzgerald PJ ,Medical hypotheses,,"It is well documented that norepinephrine (NE) releasing neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brainstem nucleus that is a major source of NE for the brain, degenerate during the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). A number of studies also suggest that, as a result, there is less NE released in the brain during disease progression, which may contribute to the pathophysiology and symptomatology of PD. This paper puts forth the novel hypothesis that NE degeneration in PD is preceded by elevated NE signaling, mainly as a result of genetics, and that this elevation is a major etiological factor in the disease. In this scenario, long-term (if not lifelong) elevated NE signaling could eventually invoke compensatory mechanisms that result in noradrenergic, and possibly dopaminergic, cell death. Several lines of evidence are briefly reviewed on the relationship between NE signaling and PD, including studies of: the level of NE; drugs that increase or decrease NE signaling; the relationship between PD and bipolar disorder, hypertension, and obesity, since the latter three conditions may be associated with increased NE signaling; and the relationship between PD and psychological stress, since stress is associated with increased release of NE. Many of these studies support NE degeneration during the disease, although some are consistent with elevated NE signaling during disease progression. Because there are few data on the state of the NE system prior to disease onset, the central point of this paper that NE signaling is elevated prior to development of PD, remains largely hypothetical. If elevated NE signaling really is an etiological factor in this disease, then early identification of susceptible individuals and long-term treatment with NE transmission reducing drugs, may help prevent or slow progression of PD.",,United States,2014,10.1016/j.mehy.2014.01.026,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24529917

Experimentally, either protective or detrimental roles have been attributed to 5-HT in the functional and morphological injury caused by mesenteric I/R. Recently, we proved the involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in the intestinal dysmotility and leukocyte recruitment induced by 45min occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) followed by 24h reperfusion in mice. Starting from these premises, the aim of our present work was to investigate the role played by endogenous 5-HT in the same experimental model where 45min SMA clamping was followed by 5h reflow. To this end, we first observed that ischemic preconditioning before I/R injury (IPC+I/R) reverted the increase in 5-HT tissue content and in inflammatory parameters induced by I/R in mice. Second, the effects produced by intravenous administration of 5-HT1A ligands (partial agonist buspirone 10mgkg(-1), antagonist WAY100135 0.5-5mgkg(-1)), 5-HT2A antagonist sarpogrelate (10mgkg(-1)), 5-HT3 antagonist alosetron (0.1mgkg(-1)), 5-HT4 antagonist GR125487 (5mgkg(-1)) and 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10mgkg(-1)) on I/R-induced inflammatory response were investigated in I/R mice and compared to those obtained in sham-operated animals (S). Our results confirmed the significant role played by 5-HT2A receptors not only in the late but also in the early I/R-induced microcirculatory dysfunction and showed that blockade of 5-HT1A receptors protected against the intestinal leukocyte recruitment, plasma extravasation and reactive oxygen species formation triggered by SMA occlusion and reflow. The ability of Î±7 nicotinic receptor (Î±7nAchR) antagonist methyllycaconitine (5mgkg(-1)) to counteract the beneficial action provided by buspirone on I/R-induced neutrophil infiltration suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect produced by 5-HT1A receptor antagonism could be partly ascribed to the indirect activation of Î±7nAch receptors.",,Netherlands,2014,10.1016/j.phrs.2014.02.002,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT(1A) receptor and Buspirone and Ischemic preconditioning and Mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion and Serotonin and <ce><b1>7 nicotinic receptor,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24548822

Angiotensin II (AII) is the primary stimulator of aldosterone production and an inhibitory role of dopamine (DA) has been suggested recently. In this study we investigated the interactions between DA and AII in the intracellular events leading to aldosterone secretion. By measuring aldosterone secretion and cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation in intact adrenal glomerulosa cells we show that AII induced a sustained stimulation of aldosterone secretion (EC50, 0.41 nM) and a rapid and transient increase in intracellular cAMP content (EC50, 4 nM). DA inhibited both aldosterone secretion (IC50, 300 nM) and cAMP formation (IC50, 100 nM) elicited by submaximal concentrations of AII; in contrast, DA did not attenuate either basal or adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated cell activity. The pharmacological characterization of DA effects with dopaminergic agonists and antagonists strongly indicated an involvement of D-2 receptors. Indeed, selective D-2 agonists were more effective than DA in inhibiting the glomerulosa cell responses to AII; in addition, the effects of DA on both aldosterone secretion and cAMP formation were prevented by D-2 antagonists, such as (-)-sulpiride and domperidone, but not by the selective D-1 antagonist SCH 23390.

Gentiopicroside (Gent) is a secoiridoid compound isolated from Gentiana lutea that exhibits analgesic properties and inhibits the expression of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex of mice. However, the effects of Gent on the reserpine-induced pain/depression dyad and its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Reserpine administration (1 mg/kg subcutaneous daily for 3 days) caused a significant decrease in the nociceptive threshold as evidenced by the reduced paw withdrawal latency in response to a radiant heat source and mechanical allodynia. Behavioral detection indicated a significant increase in immobility time during a forced swim test, as well as decreased time in the central area and total travel distance in an open field test. Furthermore, reserpinized animals exhibited increased oxidative stress. Systemic Gent administration dose-dependently ameliorated the behavioral deficits associated with reserpine-induced pain/depression dyad. At the same time, the decrease in biogenic amine levels (norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin) was integrated with the increase in caspase-3 levels and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in the amygdala of the reserpine-injected mice. Gent significantly reversed the changes in the levels of biogenic amines, caspase-3, and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in amygdala. However, Gent did not affect the expression of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors. The inhibitory effects of Gent on oxidative stress were occluded by simultaneous treatment of GluN2B receptors antagonist Ro25-6981.

Thus, it has been shown that, as in vertebrates, CNS biogenic amines (BA) including serotonin (5HT) participate in motor control in Drosophila. Several evidence show that BA systems innervate an important association area in the insect brain previously associated to the planning and/or execution of motor programs, the Mushroom Bodies (MB). The main objective of this work is to evaluate the contribution of 5HT and its receptors expressed in MB to motor behavior in fly larva. Locomotion was evaluated using an automated tracking system, in Drosophila larvae (3(rd)-instar) exposed to drugs that affect the serotonergic neuronal transmission: alpha-methyl-L-dopa, MDMA and fluoxetine. In addition, animals expressing mutations in the 5HT biosynthetic enzymes or in any of the previously identified receptors for this amine (5HT1AR, 5HT1BR, 5HT2R and 5HT7R) were evaluated in their locomotion. Finally, RNAi directed to the Drosophila 5HT receptor transcripts were expressed in MB and the effect of this manipulation on motor behavior was assessed. Data obtained in the mutants and in animals exposed to the serotonergic drugs, suggest that 5HT systems are important regulators of motor programs in fly larvae. Studies carried out in animals pan-neuronally expressing the RNAi for each of the serotonergic receptors, support this idea and further suggest that CNS 5HT pathways play a role in motor control. Moreover, animals expressing an RNAi for 5HT1BR, 5HT2R and 5HT7R in MB show increased motor behavior, while no effect is observed when the RNAi for 5HT1AR is expressed in this region. Thus, our data suggest that CNS 5HT systems are involved in motor control, and that 5HT receptors expressed in MB differentially modulate motor programs in fly larvae.",,United States,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0089641,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24586928

This dose of xylamine resulted in a 40 to 50% selective decrease in cortical levels of NE and the major metabolites of NE, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol and, when measured after 35 days, [3H]desipramine binding and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity were at control levels, which would indicate that the NE nerve terminals in the cortex were intact. The 21- or 35-day deficit of NE did not affect alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, dopamine2, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or gamma-aminobutyric acidB receptor densities, or the beta receptor mediated adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, desipramine (10 mg/kg i.p.) administration for 14 days (days 20 through 34) was able to down-regulate beta receptor number (16% decrease) and reduce NE-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (22% decrease), indicating that postsynaptic plasticity was still maintained. Affective disorders do not appear to be associated with a substantial (or readily measurable) decrease in brain NE concentrations and there is no consistent evidence of an altered beta receptor responsiveness. Thus, partial depletion of NE with xylamine might represent a biochemical model reflecting the involvement of NE in depression which could be used to investigate more sensitive markers of altered noradrenergic function.",,United States,1988,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2459367

This test allows the measurement in the same rat of inhibitory avoidance acquisition, related to generalized anxiety disorder, and of one-way escape, associated with panic disorder. The evidence so far reported with the ETM supports the above hypothesis and indicates that: (1) whereas 5-HT neurons located at the dorsal raphe nucleus are involved in the regulation of both inhibitory avoidance and escape, those of the median raphe nucleus are primarily implicated in the former task; (2) facilitation of 5-HT1A- and 5-HT2A-mediated neurotransmission in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is likely to mediate the panicolytic drug action; (3) stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors in the basolateral amygdala increases anxiety and is implicated in the anxiogenesis caused by short-term administration of antidepressant drugs, and (4) 5-HT1A and the Î¼-opioid receptors work together in the dPAG to modulate escape or panic attacks. These last results point to the possible benefits of adjunctive opioid therapy for panic patients resistant to antidepressants that act on 5-HT neurotransmission.",,United States,2014,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.03.007,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",Animal model and Antidepressants and Anxiety and Panic and Pathophysiology and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24657635

However, its function is still not fully understood. Î²PEA has been suggested to function as a neurotransmitter and/or to mimic the effect of amphetamine (Amph). In support of the latter is the observation that Î²PEA and Amph produce similar but not identical behaviors. Here, we show that Î²PEA, like Amph, activates the dopamine transporter and the amine-gated chloride channel LGC-55 to generate behaviors in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, although Amph-induced behaviors occurred gradually during 10 min of treatment, Î²PEA induced maximal effects within 1 min. In vitro data demonstrate that Î²PEA activates the LGC-55 more efficiently than Amph (Km = 9 and 152 Î¼m, respectively) and generates saturating currents that are 10 times larger than those produced by Amph. These results suggest that activation of LGC-55 mostly accounts for the behavioral effects reached after 1 min of treatment with Î²PEA. Importantly, our in vitro and in vivo data show that Amph increases the effects induced by Î²PEA on the LGC-55, indicating that Amph potentiates the effects generated by the biogenic amine Î²PEA. Together, our data not only identify a new target for Î²PEA, but also offer a novel mechanism of action of Amph.

In this study the investigation of GlyR involvement was extended to include several different drugs of abuse. By using microdialysis and electrophysiology we compared effects of addictive drugs, with and without the GlyR antagonist strychnine, on dopamine levels and neurotransmission in nucleus accumbens. The dopamine-increasing effect of systemic ethanol and the drug-induced change in neurotransmission in vitro, as measured by microdialysis and field potential recordings, were dependent on GlyRs in nAc. Accumbal GlyRs were also involved in the actions of tetrahydrocannabinol and nicotine, but not in those of cocaine or morphine.

Many psychiatric drugs bind to both types of receptors, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is known to be centrally involved with empathy. However, the relationship between the 5-HT/DA system in the ACC and empathic behavior is not yet well known. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of 5-HT/DA in empathy-like behavior and in the regulation of ACC neural activity. METHODS: An observational fear learning task was conducted following microinjections of 5-HT, DA, 5-HT and DA, methysergide (5-HT receptor antagonist), SCH-23390 (DA D1 receptor antagonist), or haloperidol (DA D2 receptor antagonist) into the mouse ACC. The ACC neural activity influenced by 5-HT and DA was electrophysiologically characterized in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The microinjection of haloperidol, but not methysergide or SCH-23390, decreased the fear response of observing mice. The administration of 5-HT and 5-HT and DA together, but not DA alone, reduced the freezing response of observing mice. 5-HT enhanced delta-band activity and reduced alpha- and gamma-band activities in the ACC, whereas DA reduced only alpha-band activity. Based on entropy, reduced complexity of ACC neural activity was observed with 5-HT treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The current results demonstrated that DA D2 receptors in the ACC are required for observational fear learning, whereas increased 5-HT levels disrupt observational fear and alter the regularity of ACC neural oscillations.",,Germany,2014,10.1007/s00213-014-3581-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24752658

Physiological roles of GRM3 in brain functions and its functional roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia remain to be resolved. RESULTS: We generated mGluR3 knockout (KO) mice and conducted comprehensive behavioral analyses. KO mice showed hyperactivity in the open field, light/dark transition, and 24-hour home cage monitoring tests, impaired reference memory for stressful events in the Porsolt forced swim test, impaired contextual memory in cued and contextual fear conditioning test, and impaired working memory in the T-Maze forced alternation task test. Hyperactivity and impaired working memory are known as endophenotypes of schizophrenia. We examined long-term synaptic plasticity by assessing long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region in the hippocampi of KO and wild-type (WT) mice. We observed no differences in the amplitude of LTP between the two genotypes, suggesting that mGluR3 is not essential for LTP in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. As hyperactivity is typically associated with increased dopaminergic transmission, we performed in vivo microdialysis measurements of extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens of KO and WT mice. We observed enhancements in the methamphetamine (MAP)-induced release of dopamine in KO mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that a disturbance in the glutamate-dopamine interaction may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia-like behavior, such as hyperactivity in mGluR3 KO mice.",,England,2014,10.1186/1756-6606-7-31,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24758191

Current- and voltage-clamp methods were used to evaluate the intracellular and ionic mechanisms involved in dopamine-induced slow depolarizations recorded from neurones of the LB cluster in the abdominal ganglion of Aplysia kurodai. 2. In voltage-clamped cells, dopamine induced a slow inward current that, over the range studied (-40 to -110 mV), decreased in amplitude with hyperpolarization of the cell, but failed to invert when the cell was hyperpolarized beyond the reversal potential for K+,(E)K. 3. Bathing the ganglion in 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) caused a significant increase in the dopamine response. 4. Most of the responses to dopamine were markedly augmented in Ca2+-free media, but were depressed in Na+-free media. 5. An intracellular injection of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) into the same cell type produced an inward current which, like the response to dopamine, diminished in amplitude with hyperpolarization of the cell. 6. Like the dopamine response, the cyclic AMP response increased in the presence of IBMX, was enhanced in Ca2+-free media, was depressed in Na+-free media, and was unaffected by changes in external potassium. 7. In a few cells, although the cyclic AMP-induced responses disappeared in Na+-free media, the dopamine-induced slow inward current responses did not. However, these Na+-free resistant responses disappeared completely in Na+- and Ca2+-free media. 8. It was concluded that most of the dopamine-induced inward current responses were produced by an increase in permeability, mainly to Na+, triggered by a receptor-controlled increase in intracellular cyclic AMP.",,England,1988,10.1113/jphysiol.1988.sp017410,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2476551

Stress-related psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety are often comorbid with gastrointestinal function disorder, such as IBS. However, the mechanism of IBS still remains unknown. Curcumin is a biologically active phytochemical presents in turmeric and has pharmacological actions that benefit patients with depression and anxiety. Our study found that IBS rats showed depression- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with decreased 5-HT (serotonin), BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor) and pCREB (phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein) expression in the hippocampus after chronic acute combining stress (CAS). However, these decreased parameters were obviously increased in the colonic after CAS. Curcumin (40 mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of forced swimming and the number of buried marbles in behavioral tests of CAS rats. Curcumin also decreased the number of fecal output and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores in response to graded distention. Moreover, curcumin increased serotonin, BDNF and pCREB levels in the hippocampus, but they were decreased in the colonic of CAS rats. 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist NAN-190 reversed the effects of curcumin on behaviors and the changes of intestine, pCREB and BDNF expression, which are related to IBS. These results suggested that curcumin exerts the effects on IBS through regulating neurotransmitters, BDNF and CREB signaling both in the brain and peripheral intestinal system.",,United States,2015,10.1007/s11011-014-9554-z,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24807589

Intriguingly, recent meta-analyses have highlighted an asymmetrical relationship between the two conditions as depressed patients were found to display a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those individuals suffering from diabetes are to become depressed. Based on recent findings, we favor a hypothesis where by decreased peripheral serotonin (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT) function is a reciprocal risk factor for the co-morbidity of depression and diabetes, as it can trigger inflammatory pathogenetic mechanisms of both conditions. Higher intestinal levels of 5-HT and 5-HT3 receptor stimulation lead to increased intestinal permeability in 5-HTT deficient mice, which is viewed one of the most relevant animal models of depression. We hypothesize that this leakage of bacterial endotoxins can activate both central and peripheral Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which inhibits insulin signaling and IRS1/PI3K/Akt and thus, contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes and depression that are associated with this pathway. Antidepressant therapies, which also suppress intestinal 5-HTT, may have potentiating effects on the association between depression and diabetes. It is also of interest that high carbohydrate and fat intake (""cafeteria-type diet"") increases intestinal 5-HT leading to TLR4 activation. Thus, endotoxaemia and inflammation owing to increased intestinal 5-HT may underpin the depression and diabetes association, where the risk of the latter pathology becomes particularly preeminent after the onset of depression and not vice versa. The evidence presented here shows the further investigation into peripheral mechanisms that linked diabetes to depression is clearly warranted.",,Netherlands,2015,10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.049,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",5-HT and Antidepressant and Depression and Endotoxemia and Inflammation and Insulin resistance,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24815315

Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a form of neuroplasticity that is believed to be the physiological basis for memory. It has been postulated that antipsychotic medication can impair long-term potentiation and cognition by altering dopaminergic transmission. Thus, a systematic review was performed in order to assess the relationship between antipsychotics and D2 antagonists on long-term potentiation. The majority of studies on LTP and antipsychotics have found that acute administration of antipsychotics was associated with impairments in LTP in wild-type animals. In contrast, chronic administration and acute antipsychotics in animal models of schizophrenia were not. Typical and atypical antipsychotics and other D2 antagonists behaved similarly, with the exception of clozapine and olanzapine. Clozapine caused potentiation independent of tetanization, while olanzapine facilitated tetanus-induced potentiation. These studies are limited in their ability to model the effects of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia as they were largely performed in wild-type animals as opposed to humans with schizophrenia, and assessed after acute rather than chronic treatment. Further studies using patients with schizophrenia receiving chronic antipsychotic treatment are needed to better understand the effects of these medications in this population.",,England,2014,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2014.05.001,Journal Article and Review and Systematic Review,Animals and Antipsychotics and D2 and Humans and LTP and Neurophysiology,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24819820

However, despite ECT's widespread use, the exact neurobiological mechanisms underlying its efficacy are not fully understood. Over the past 3 decades, extensive work in rodents, primates, and humans has begun to delineate the impact of electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) and ECT on neurotransmission systems commonly implicated in depression. In the current review, we will focus on two major biogenic amine systems, namely serotonin and dopamine. METHODS: The database of PubMed was searched for preclinical studies describing the effects of ECS on the serotonergic and dopaminergic system using behavioral sensitization paradigms, in vivo brain microdialysis, messenger RNA and protein expression, electrophysiology, and positron emission tomography. Additionally, human data describing ECT's effects on neurotransmitter turnover, receptor binding, and functional imaging were reviewed together with relevant genetic association studies. RESULTS: Literature research resulted in 40 published original studies related to ECS/ECT and the serotonergic system, whereby only three were studies in humans. Regarding dopamine, 15 preclinical and 12 human studies were found in PubMed database. CONCLUSIONS: Converging data obtained from genetic and imaging studies in humans have corroborated many of the earlier preclinical and clinical findings relating to enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission and activation of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system after ECS/ECT. Moreover, it seems that these effects are evident at various levels, including neurotransmitter release, receptor binding, and overall neurotransmission.

Loss of cognitive flexibility, a component of depression, is associated with dysregulation of the prefrontal cortex. Reversal learning, a form of cognitive flexibility, is impaired by chronic stress, a risk factor for depression, and the stress-induced impairment in reversal learning is sensitive to chronic SSRI treatment, and is mimicked by serotonin (5-HT) depletion. Vortioxetine, a novel, multimodal-acting antidepressant, is a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, a 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibits the 5-HT transporter. Using adult male rats, we first investigated the direct effects of vortioxetine, acting at post-synaptic 5-HT receptors, on reversal learning that was compromised by 5-HT depletion using 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride (PCPA), effectively eliminating any contribution of 5-HT reuptake blockade. PCPA induced a reversal learning impairment that was alleviated by acute or sub-chronic vortioxetine administration, suggesting that post-synaptic 5-HT receptor activation contributes to the effects of vortioxetine. We then investigated the effects of chronic dietary administration of vortioxetine on reversal learning that had been compromised in intact animals exposed to chronic intermittent cold (CIC) stress, to assess vortioxetine's total pharmacological effect. CIC stress impaired reversal learning, and chronic vortioxetine administration prevented the reversal-learning deficit. Together, these results suggest that the direct effect of vortioxetine at 5-HT receptors may contribute to positive effects on cognitive flexibility deficits, and may enhance the effect of 5-HT reuptake blockade.",,England,2014,10.1017/S1461145714000571,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24852131

Despite evidence that abnormalities in dopaminergic neurotransmission and prefrontal cortex function co-occur in schizophrenia, the influence of OFC DA on caudate DA and reinforcement processing is poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that OFC dopaminergic dysfunction disrupts caudate dopamine function, we selectively depleted dopamine from the OFC of marmoset monkeys and measured striatal extracellular dopamine levels (using microdialysis) and dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding (using positron emission tomography), while modeling reinforcement-related behavior in a discrimination learning paradigm. OFC dopamine depletion caused an increase in tonic dopamine levels in the caudate nucleus and a corresponding reduction in D2/D3 receptor binding. Computational modeling of behavior showed that the lesion increased response exploration, reducing the tendency to persist with a recently chosen response side. This effect is akin to increased response switching previously seen in schizophrenia and was correlated with striatal but not OFC D2/D3 receptor binding.

In many cases the coordinated differentiation of presynaptic and postsynaptic domains implicates trans-synaptic interactions between membrane-associated proteins such as neurexins and neuroligins. The Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular junction (NMJ) provides a genetically tractable system in which to analyse the segregation of neurotransmitter receptors, because muscle cells receive excitatory innervation from cholinergic neurons and inhibitory innervation from GABAergic neurons. Here we show that Ce-Punctin/madd-4 (ref. 5), the C.â€‰elegans orthologue of mammalian punctin-1 and punctin-2, encodes neurally secreted isoforms that specify the excitatory or inhibitory identity of postsynaptic NMJ domains. These proteins belong to the ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin repeats)-like family, a class of extracellular matrix proteins related to the ADAM proteases but devoid of proteolytic activity. Ce-Punctin deletion causes the redistribution of synaptic acetylcholine and GABAA (Î³-aminobutyric acidâ€‰type A) receptors into extrasynaptic clusters, whereas neuronal presynaptic boutons remain unaltered. Alternative promoters generate different Ce-Punctin isoforms with distinct functions. A short isoform is expressed by cholinergic and GABAergic motoneurons and localizes to excitatory and inhibitory NMJs, whereas long isoforms are expressed exclusively by cholinergic motoneurons and are confined to cholinergic NMJs. The differential expression of these isoforms controls the congruence between presynaptic and postsynaptic domains: specific disruption of the short isoform relocalizes GABAA receptors from GABAergic to cholinergic synapses, whereas expression of a long isoform in GABAergic neurons recruits acetylcholine receptors to GABAergic NMJs.

In the current study we investigated whether a 5HT6 antagonist, SB399885 would show antidepressant like property at a dose which would significantly increase the glutamate levels. Further we studied if the combination of a 5HT6 antagonist and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine would restore the antidepressant property. As dementia and depression are co-morbid, we evaluated if this combination would have an effect on cognition. METHODS: The antidepressant like property of SB399885 alone and in combination with memantine was investigated using the forced swim test (FST). Object recognition task (ORT) was used to investigate the combination therapy on cognition. Additionally, glutamate levels in prefrontal cortex and corresponding brain concentration of SB399885 were determined. RESULTS: Brain concentrations of SB399885 equal to or greater than 553 nM significantly increased brain glutamate levels and reduced immobility time in FST. When combined with memantine, glutamate levels and immobility time in FST was reduced. A dose dependent increase in the discriminative index was observed in ORT. CONCLUSION: Loss of antidepressant like property seen at the highest tested dose of SB399885 could be due to increased glutamate levels which was reversed by memantine. Combining memantine and SB399885 offers the advantage of extending the therapeutic window of antidepressant like property of SB399885 as well as having procognitive effect.

In previous studies we have shown that this is not classical insulin resistance but the drugs were actually inducing a hyperglycaemic state associated with elevated hepatic glucose output (HGO) and increased levels of glucagon and insulin. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are directly elicited by drug actions in the liver and pancreas, or whether they are indirectly mediated. Here we investigated if clozapine is capable of inducing insulin resistance in the liver or enhancing insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreas. It was observed that insulin signalling was elevated in livers from animals treated with clozapine indicating there was no insulin resistance in the early steps of insulin signalling. To explore whether the defects arise at later stages of insulin action we used an isolated perfused liver system. In this model, clozapine had no direct effect on insulin's counter regulatory effect on epinephrine-induced HGO. In isolated mouse islets clozapine significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while simultaneously blocking glucose-induced reductions in glucagon secretion. We also show that the non-peptidic glucagon receptor like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist Boc5 was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of clozapine on glucose metabolism. Taken together these results suggest that clozapine does not have any direct effect on glucose metabolism in the liver but it simultaneously stimulates insulin and glucagon secretion, a situation that would allow for the concurrent presence of high glucose and high insulin levels in treated animals.",,Netherlands,2014,10.1016/j.schres.2014.05.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Clozapine and Diabetes and Insulin signalling and Schizophrenia,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24906220

Brexpiprazole inhibited conditioned avoidance response (ED50 = 6.0 mg/kg), apomorphine- or d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity (ED50 = 2.3 and 0.90, respectively), and apomorphine-induced stereotypy (ED50 = 2.9) in rats at clinically relevant D2 receptor occupancies. Brexpiprazole also potently inhibited apomorphine-induced eye blinking in monkeys. The results suggest that brexpiprazole has antipsychotic potential. Brexpiprazole induced catalepsy (ED50 = 20) well above clinically relevant D2 receptor occupancies, suggesting a low risk for extrapyramidal side effects. Subchronic treatment with phencyclidine (PCP) induced cognitive impairment in both novel object recognition (NOR) and attentional set-shifting (ID-ED) tests in rats. Brexpiprazole reversed the PCP-induced cognitive impairment in the NOR test at 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, and in the ID-ED test at 1.0 mg/kg. However, aripiprazole (10 mg/kg) was ineffective in both tests, despite achieving relevant D2 occupancies. In the NOR test, the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone and the 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 [(R)-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)[1-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperidin-4-yl]methanol] partially but significantly reversed PCP-induced impairment.

The results indicate that brexpiprazole has antipsychotic-like activity and robust efficacy in relevant models of cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. The effects of brexpiprazole in the cognitive tests are superior to those of aripiprazole.

Both animal and clinical studies have shown that co-treatment with betahistine (a histaminergic H1 receptor agonist and H3 receptor antagonist) is effective for ameliorating olanzapine-induced weight gain/obesity. To reveal the mechanisms underlying these effects, this study investigated the effects of co-treatment of olanzapine and betahistine (O+B) on expressions of histaminergic H1 receptor (H1R), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), neuropeptide Y (NPY), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the hypothalamus associated with reducing olanzapine-induced weight gain. Olanzapine significantly upregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of H1R, while O+B co-treatment significantly downregulated the H1R levels, compared to the olanzapine-only treatment group. The NPY mRNA expression was significantly enhanced by olanzapine, but it was significantly reversed by O+B co-treatment. The hypothalamic H1R expression was positively correlated with total food intake, and NPY expression. Olanzapine also increased AMPKÎ± activation measured by the AMPKÎ± phosphorylation (pAMPKÎ±)/AMPKÎ± ratio compared with controls, whereas O+B co-treatment decreased the pAMPKÎ±/AMPKÎ± ratio, compared with olanzapine only treatment. The pAMPKÎ±/AMPKÎ± ratio was positively correlated with total food intake and H1R expression. Although olanzapine administration decreased the POMC mRNA level, this level was not affected by O+B co-treatment. Therefore, these results suggested that co-treatment with betahistine may reverse olanzapine-induced body weight gain via the H1R-NPY and H1R-pAMPKÎ± pathways.",,England,2014,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2014.06.010,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",AMP-activated protein kinase and Betahistine and Body weight gain and Food intake and Histamine H(1) receptors and Neuropeptide Y and Olanzapine,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-24992721

The Gs-protein coupled to the D1 receptor was eliminated by mild thermal inactivation, and the Gi- (or Go-) protein associated with the D2 receptor by alkylation with a low concentration of N-ethyl-maleimide. Incubation of striatal membranes at 60 degrees C completely abolished the specific binding of 3H-GTP. Both treatments resulted in an increase of the IC50-values for dopamine as a displacer of 3H-SCH 23390 from D1- and of 3H-spiperone from D2 receptors. Concomitantly, the formerly shallow D1 displacement curves became steeper, with their Hill coefficients increasing. This effect was less evident at D2 receptors. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which increased the IC50's of dopamine for both receptors approximately two-fold in control membranes, was without effect in pretreated samples, indicating an effective inactivation of the G-proteins. Na+ ions were still able to lower, and Ca2+ ions to increase the affinities of D1 and D2 receptors for dopamine after such inactivation of the respective G-proteins. It is concluded that the mechanism underlying the regulation of dopamine receptor affinities by mono- and divalent cations is independent of and superimposed upon the coupling of these receptors to guanyl nucleotide binding proteins.",,Germany,1989,10.1007/BF00736050,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2500603

We modeled a dysfunctional dopaminergic system using mice with targeted ablation of dopamine (DA) D2 autoreceptors in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons.

Here, we show that this mutation leads to a profound alteration of the genomic landscape of neurons receiving dopaminergic afferents at distal sites, specifically in the prefrontal cortex. Indeed, we observed a remarkable downregulation of gene expression in this area of ~2000 genes, which involves a widespread increase in the histone repressive mark H3K9me2/3. This reprogramming process is coupled to psychotic-like behaviors in the mutant mice. Importantly, chronic treatment with a DA agonist can revert the genomic phenotype.

Therefore, we investigated 5-HT-induced contraction and associated mechanisms in carotid arteries from chronic T2D Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats. Contractions in response to 5-HT were examined in carotid arteries from GK rats (42-46 weeks old). To investigate the response mechanisms of arterial smooth muscle, we constructed concentration-response curves for TCB2 (5-HT2A-receptor agonist), BW723C86 (5-HT2B-receptor agonist), and 5-HT in the presence of various inhibitors using endothelium-denuded preparations. Carotid arterial expressions of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), serotonin transporter (SERT), and 5-HT2A were detected by immunoblotting. 5-HT-induced contraction was increased in carotid arteries from GK compared to control Wistar rats in both endothelium-intact and -denuded preparations. In denuded preparations, we found that: (1) TCB2-induced contraction was increased in GK rat arteries (vs. Wistar); (2) MAO-A inhibitor did not affect 5-HT-induced contraction, whereas SERT inhibitor augmented such contractions in both groups; and (3) differences in 5-HT-induced contractions were abolished by p38 MAPK, PI3K, and Rho kinase inhibitors. Carotid arterial expressions of MAO-A, SERT, and 5-HT2A remained unchanged in the groups. The results suggest that 5-HT-induced contraction is augmented in T2D GK rat carotid arteries.

Gamma oscillations are disrupted in disorders for which cognitive deficits are hallmark symptoms such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.In vitro, various neurotransmitters have been found to modulate gamma oscillations. Serotonin(5-HT) has long been known to be important for both behavioural and cognitive functions such as learning and memory. Multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes are expressed in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and high doses of 5-HT reduce the power of induced gamma oscillations.Hypothesizing that 5-HT may have cell- and receptor subtype-specific modulatory effects, we investigated the receptor subtypes, cell types and cellular mechanisms engaged by 5-HT in the modulation of gamma oscillations in mice and rats. We found that 5-HT decreases the power of kainate-induced hippocampal gamma oscillations in both species via the 5-HT1A receptor subtype. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings demonstrated that this decrease was caused by a hyperpolarization of CA3 pyramidal cells and a reduction of their firing frequency, but not by alteration of inhibitory neurotransmission.

We investigated the involvement of dopamine-Dâ‚ƒ receptors in the effects of blonanserin on cognitive impairment in an animal model of schizophrenia. We also sought to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying this involvement. Blonanserin, as well as olanzapine, significantly ameliorated phencyclidine (PCP)-induced impairment of visual-recognition memory, as demonstrated by the novel-object recognition test (NORT) and increased extracellular dopamine levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). With blonanserin, both of these effects were antagonized by DOI (a serotonin 5-HTâ‚‚A receptor agonist) and 7-OH-DPAT (a dopamine-Dâ‚ƒ receptor agonist), whereas the effects of olanzapine were antagonized by DOI but not by 7-OH-DPAT. The ameliorating effect was also antagonized by SCH23390 (a dopamine-Dâ‚ receptor antagonist) and H-89 (a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor). Blonanserin significantly remediated the decrease in phosphorylation levels of PKA at Thr(197) and of NR1 (an essential subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors) at Ser(897) by PKA in the mPFC after a NORT training session in the PCP-administered mice. There were no differences in the levels of NR1 phosphorylated at Ser(896) by PKC in any group. These results suggest that the ameliorating effect of blonanserin on PCP-induced cognitive impairment is associated with indirect functional stimulation of the dopamine-Dâ‚-PKA-NMDA receptor pathway following augmentation of dopaminergic neurotransmission due to inhibition of both dopamine-Dâ‚ƒ and serotonin 5-HTâ‚‚A receptors in the mPFC.",,England,2015,10.1038/npp.2014.207,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25120077

Modeling revealed two potential mechanisms for the drop in accumbal dopamine efflux evoked by the selective Î±7 partial agonist TC-7020. TC-7020 could desensitize Î±7 NNRs located predominantly on dopamine neurons or glutamatergic afferents to them or, alternatively, activate Î±7 NNRs located on the glutamatergic afferents to GABAergic interneurons in the ventral tegmental area. Only the model based on desensitization, however, was able to explain the neutralizing effect of coapplied PNU-120596, a positive allosteric modulator.

However, BPN's effects in preclinical tests for mood and antidepressant efficacy are largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the effects of BPN in the forced swim test (FST) and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test as measures of antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects in C57BL/6Â J mice. Microdialysis was used to measure whether BPN engaged kappa-opioid receptor (KORs) in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh) at a behaviorally active dose (0.25Â mg/kg). METHODS: BPN was tested in the FST at both 30Â min and 24Â h post-administration. Also measured in the FST at 24Â h post-administration were the KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI), the MOR agonist morphine and the reference antidepressant desipramine. The anxiolytic effects of BPN were examined in the NIH test 24Â h after treatment. The effects of acute injection of BPN and the KOR agonist U50,488 were measured on extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the NAcSh. RESULTS: BPN produced significant reductions in FST immobility without changing locomotor activity and reduced approach latencies in the novel environment of the NIH test when tested 24Â h after treatment. Repeated daily BPN injections for 6Â days did not produce tolerance to these behavioral effects. nor-BNI produced a similar antidepressant-like response in the FST 24Â h post-injection but morphine and desipramine were ineffective. BPN (0.25Â mg/kg) did not alter DA levels when given alone but prevented the KOR agonist U50,488 from reducing DA levels. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and subchronic treatment with BPN produced antidepressant and anxiolytic-like responses in mice at doses that engage KORs.

Since ACh and DA stimulated PAF production at different stages of development, we advanced the hypothesis that selected cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors were involved. In this paper we demonstrate that only muscarinic or D2 (and not D1 and nicotinic) receptor stimulation induced PAF production in the chick retina either before or after hatching. Moreover, our data show that PAF production was completely prevented by blockage of these receptors by specific antagonists.

A role for impaired short-term habituation and the GRIA1 (GluA1) AMPA receptor subunit.,Barkus C and Sanderson DJ and Rawlins JN and Walton ME and Harrison PJ and Bannerman DM ,Molecular psychiatry,,"The GRIA1 locus, encoding the GluA1 (also known as GluRA or GluR1) AMPA glutamate receptor subunit, shows genome-wide association to schizophrenia. As well as extending the evidence that glutamatergic abnormalities have a key role in the disorder, this finding draws attention to the behavioural phenotype of Gria1 knockout mice. These mice show deficits in short-term habituation. Importantly, under some conditions the attention being paid to a recently presented neutral stimulus can actually increase rather than decrease (sensitization). We propose that this mouse phenotype represents a cause of aberrant salience and, in turn, that aberrant salience (and the resulting positive symptoms) in schizophrenia may arise, at least in part, from a glutamatergic genetic predisposition and a deficit in short-term habituation. This proposal links an established risk gene with a psychological process central to psychosis and is supported by findings of comparable deficits in short-term habituation in mice lacking the NMDAR receptor subunit Grin2a (which also shows association to schizophrenia). As aberrant salience is primarily a dopaminergic phenomenon, the model supports the view that the dopaminergic abnormalities can be downstream of a glutamatergic aetiology. Finally, we suggest that, as illustrated here, the real value of genetically modified mice is not as 'models of schizophrenia' but as experimental tools that can link genomic discoveries with psychological processes and help elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms.",,England,2014,10.1038/mp.2014.91,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25224260

When these two substitutions are introduced into the endogenous Foxp2 gene of mice (Foxp2(hum)), cortico-basal ganglia circuits are specifically affected. Here we demonstrate marked effects of this humanization of Foxp2 on learning and striatal neuroplasticity. Foxp2(hum/hum) mice learn stimulus-response associations faster than their WT littermates in situations in which declarative (i.e., place-based) and procedural (i.e., response-based) forms of learning could compete during transitions toward proceduralization of action sequences. Striatal districts known to be differently related to these two modes of learning are affected differently in the Foxp2(hum/hum) mice, as judged by measures of dopamine levels, gene expression patterns, and synaptic plasticity, including an NMDA receptor-dependent form of long-term depression.

Despite their importance for normal and pathological behavior, the mechanisms underlying endogenous mood instability are largely unknown. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Otx2 orchestrates the genetic networks directing the specification of dopaminergic (DA) and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons. Here we behaviorally phenotyped mouse mutants overexpressing Otx2 in the hindbrain, resulting in an increased number of DA neurons and a decreased number of 5-HT neurons in both developing and mature animals. Over the course of 1 month, control animals exhibited stable locomotor activity in their home cages, whereas mutants showed extended periods of elevated or decreased activity relative to their individual average. Additional behavioral paradigms, testing for manic- and depressive-like behavior, demonstrated that mutants showed an increase in intra-individual fluctuations in locomotor activity, habituation, risk-taking behavioral parameters, social interaction, and hedonic-like behavior. Olanzapine, lithium, and carbamazepine ameliorated the behavioral alterations of the mutants, as did the mixed serotonin receptor agonist quipazine and the specific 5-HT2C receptor agonist CP-809101. Testing the relevance of the genetic networks specifying monoaminergic neurons for BPD in humans, we applied an interval-based enrichment analysis tool for genome-wide association studies.

The results demonstrated that, STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited increased duration of immobility and decreased swimming behavior in FST, reduced exploratory behavior during hole-board test and increased aversion to brightly illuminated light area in light-dark test as compared to non-diabetic mice, while ondansetron (similar to fluoxetine) treatment significantly reversed the same. Biochemical assay revealed that ondansetron administration attenuated diabetes-induced neurochemical impairment of serotonin function, indicated by elevated serotonin levels in discrete brain regions of diabetic mice.

The effects of beer intake in coronary vasodilation remain unknown. We investigated whether regular beer intake (alcohol and alcohol-free) protects against hypercholesterolaemia-induced coronary endothelial dysfunction and the mechanisms behind this effect. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pigs were fed 10Â days: (i) a Western-type hypercholesterolaemic diet (WD); (ii) WD+low-dose beer (12Â·5Â g alcohol/day); (iii) WD+moderate-dose beer (25Â g alcohol/day); or (iv) WD+moderate-dose alcohol-free-beer (0Â·0Â g alcohol/day). Coronary responses to endothelium-dependent vasoactive drugs (acetylcholine: receptor mediated; calcium ionophore-A23189: nonreceptor mediated), endothelium-independent vasoactive drug (SNP) and L-NMMA (NOS-antagonist) were evaluated in the LAD coronary artery by flow Doppler. Coronary Akt/eNOS activation, MCP-1 expression, oxidative DNA damage and superoxide production were assessed. Lipid profile, lipoproteins resistance to oxidation and urinary isoxanthohumol concentration were evaluated. RESULTS: Alcoholic and nonalcoholic beer intake prevented WD-induced impairment of receptor- and non-receptor-operated endothelial-dependent coronary vasodilation. All animals displayed a similar vasodilatory response to SNP and L-NMMA blunted all endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation responses. Haemodynamic parameters remained unchanged. Coronary arteries showed lower DNA damage and increased Akt/eNOS axis activation in beer-fed animals.

The inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis, p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), did not prevent the effect induced by imipramine plus TRH. Blockade of dopaminergic systems by gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) (37.5 mg kg-1, i.p.), alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) (125 mg kg-1, i.p.) and apomorphine (0.025 mg kg-1, i.p.) antagonized the effects induced by various antidepressants alone (at high, effective doses) or at lower ineffective doses in association with TRH. The effect induced by imipramine plus TRH was also blocked by sulpiride (16 mg kg-1, i.p.). Pretreatment with the opioid antagonist, naloxone, inhibited the effects induced by nomifensine plus TRH or mianserin plus TRH but not those induced by nortriptyline plus TRH, maprotiline plus TRH or amineptine plus TRH. When high active doses of the antidepressants were used alone, only the clomipramine effect was blocked by naloxone. 3. These data indicate that TRH is able to potentiate the effect not only of imipramine but of other antidepressants in the mouse forced-swimming test, although these other antidepressants act in various ways on cerebral amines. The antagonism of the effects induced by the antidepressants alone or in association with TRH after blockade of dopaminergic systems may indicate a reversal of the effect of the antidepressants by blockade of dopaminergic systems. Hence, the same mechanisms would be involved in the effects induced by antidepressants alone or in association with TRH, with respect to dopaminergic systems. However, different mechanisms of action seem to be responsible for the potentiation of TRH of the effect of the various antidepressants, since the involvement of the opioid systems varies according to the antidepressant tested.",,England,1989,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1989.tb11942.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2541855

Developmental brain research,,"Electrophysiological and quantitative autoradiographic receptor binding approaches were used to characterize the postnatal development of alpha 1-adrenergic and serotonergic receptors in the midbrain dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in rats. Dose-response data were obtained from extracellular records of the firing of DRN neurons recorded in midbrain slices perfused with artificial cerebral spinal fluid containing varying concentrations of the drugs investigated. These data indicated that DRN neurons, at all postnatal ages, are equally sensitive to the excitatory effects of phenylephrine (an alpha 1-norepinephrine agonist) and the inhibitory effects of serotonin (5-HT). In contrast, LSD (a 5-HT agonist) was considerably more potent in neonates as compared to adults. With one exception, the autoradiographic binding data was found to be in agreement with the electrophysiological findings. There were no observed changes in the number of alpha 1-adrenergic ([3H]prazosin) binding sites at different ages suggesting that cells in this region exhibit functionally mature alpha 1-adrenergic responses at birth. Similarly, the number of [3H]LSD binding sites was found to increase in older animals consistent with the increased potency of LSD in older animals. Paradoxically, the number of [3H]5-HT sites was observed to increase with age, a finding inconsistent with the functional data obtained using 5-HT in the slice.

We explored their role in the neuromodulation of neonatal rat spinal cord motor circuits. We first showed that the spinal cord contains the substrates for TA biosynthesis (AADC) and for receptor-mediated actions via trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) 1 and 4. We next examined the actions of the TAs on motor activity using the in vitro isolated neonatal rat spinal cord. Tyramine and tryptamine most consistently increased motor activity with prominent direct actions on motoneurons. In the presence of N-methyl-D-aspartate, all applied TAs supported expression of a locomotor-like activity (LLA) that was indistinguishable from that ordinarily observed with serotonin, suggesting that the TAs act on common central pattern generating neurons. The TAs also generated distinctive complex rhythms characterized by episodic bouts of LLA. TA actions on locomotor circuits did not require interaction with descending monoaminergic projections since evoked LLA was maintained following block of all Na(+)-dependent monoamine transporters or the vesicular monoamine transporter. Instead, TA (tryptamine and tyramine) actions depended on intracellular uptake via pentamidine-sensitive Na(+)-independent membrane transporters. Requirement for intracellular transport is consistent with the TAs having much slower LLA onset than serotonin and for activation of intracellular TAARs. To test for endogenous actions following biosynthesis, we increased intracellular amino acid levels with cycloheximide. LLA emerged and included distinctive TA-like episodic bouts. In summary, we provided anatomical and functional evidence of the TAs as an intrinsic spinal monoaminergic modulatory system capable of promoting recruitment of locomotor circuits independent of the descending monoamines.

Systematic hippocampal dopaminergic dysfunction can cause deficits in spatial working memory and impair consolidation of contextual fear memories. CA3 is involved in the rapid acquisition of new memories and has extensive nerve fibre connections with other brain structures such as CA1, the amygdala, and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). A bidirectional fibrous connection between CA3 and the amygdala reflects the importance of CA3 in fear conditioning. The present study evaluated the effects of a 6-OHDA lesion in CA3 on the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear. The results showed CA3 involvement in the expression but not the acquisition of conditioned fear. Injection of SCH23390 and quinpirole into the bilateral CA3 attenuated a conditioned fear-related freezing response, whereas SKF38393 and sulpiride were not associated with this effect. The present study found that a 6-OHDA lesion in CA3 up-regulated the expression of GluR1 in BLA and down-regulated NR2B in CA1 and the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Our data suggest that dopamine depletion in hippocampal subdivision CA3 may not be necessary for the acquisition of conditioned fear, but the expression of conditioned fear is likely dependent on the integrity of mesohippocampal dopaminergic connections. It is probable that both D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors modulate the expression of conditioned fear.

Both clinical studies and animal research have implicated the dopamine neuromodulator neurotensin (NT) in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Utilizing male mice lacking the NT gene (NT(-/-)), these studies examined the consequences of NT deficiency on dopaminergic tone and function, investigating (1) dopamine concentrations and dopamine receptor and transporter expression and binding in dopaminergic terminal regions, and (2) the behavioral effects of selective dopamine receptor agonists on locomotion and sensorimotor gating in adult NT(-/-) mice compared to wildtype (NT(+/+)) mice. NT(-/-) mice did not differ from NT(+/+) mice in concentrations of dopamine or its metabolite DOPAC in any brain region examined. However, NT(-/-) mice showed significantly increased D1 receptor, D2 receptor, and dopamine transporter (DAT) mRNA in the caudate putamen compared to NT(+/+) controls. NT(-/-) mice also showed elevated D2 receptor binding densities in both the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens shell compared to NT(+/+) mice. In addition, some of the behavioral effects of the D1-type receptor agonist SKF-82958 and the D2-type receptor agonist quinpirole on locomotion, startle amplitude, and prepulse inhibition were dose-dependently altered in NT(-/-) mice, showing altered D1-type and D2-type receptor sensitivity to stimulation by agonists in the absence of NT. The results indicate that NT deficiency alters striatal dopamine receptor expression, binding, and function.

Compared to the wealth of data on the impairment of the dopamine system, relatively limited evidence is available concerning the role of major non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in PD. Therefore, we comprehensively investigated the density and distribution of neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine in brains of homozygous aphakia mice being characterized by mutations affecting the Pitx3 gene. This genetic model exhibits crucial hallmarks of PD on the neuropathological, symptomatic and pharmacological level. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to characterize 19 different receptor binding sites in eleven brain regions in order to understand receptor changes on a systemic level. We demonstrated striking differential changes of neurotransmitter receptor densities for numerous receptor types and brain regions, respectively. Most prominent, a strong up-regulation of GABA receptors and associated benzodiazepine binding sites in different brain regions and concomitant down-regulations of striatal nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonergic receptor densities were found. Furthermore, the densities of glutamatergic kainate, muscarinic acetylcholine, adrenergic Î±1 and dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors were differentially altered. These results present novel insights into the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in Pitx3(ak) mice supporting findings on PD pathology in patients and indicating on the possible underlying mechanisms.

Preliminary analysis showed that aqueous extract (AE) of Saccharum induced yawns in rats. So, we aimed to quantify these behavioral responses and investigate the pharmacological mechanisms involved in these actions. During 120 min, after AE administration, the yawns and the genital grooming were quantified at 10 min intervals. Since dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways are implied in these responses, AE were evaluated in the presence of haloperidol 0.5 mg/kg and atropine 2 mg/kg. AE 0.5 g/kg increased the yawns, effect that was blocked both by haloperidol and atropine. Genital grooming could only be stimulated by AE 0.5 g/kg when dopaminergic receptors were blocked by haloperidol. However, it was inhibited when atropine was previously administered. So, we demonstrated a central action of Saccharum and it was postulated that neural circuits with the participation of dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways are involved. The fact that AE is comprised of innumerous compounds could justify the extract's distinct responses. Also, we cannot disregard the presence of different neural circuits that count on the participation of dopaminergic and cholinergic pathways and could be activated by the same induction agent.",,Ireland,2015,10.1016/j.neulet.2014.10.027,Journal Article,Acetylcholine and Dopamine and Grooming and Rats and Saccharum and Yawning,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25459296

Decne, (Lardizabalaceae)] produce antidepressant-like effects in animal depressive behavior tests. FAE contains approximately 70% of hederagenin (HG) as its main chemical component. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the antidepressant ability of FAE with that of HG in mice and further investigated the antidepressant-like effects and potential mechanisms of HG in rats subjected to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice received FAE (50 mg/kg) and HG (20 mg/kg) once a day via intragastric administration (i.g.) for 3 weeks. The anxiolytic and antidepressant activities of FAE and HG were compared using elevated plus maze (EPM) and behavioral despair tests including tail suspension test (TST) and forced swimming test (FST), respectively. Antidepressant effects of HG (5 mg/kg) were assessed using the UCMS depressive rat model. Moreover, the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters and relevant gene expression in UCMS rats' hippocampi were determined through high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection and real-time polymerase chain reaction techniques. RESULTS: The results of our preliminary screening test suggest that HG at 20 mg/kg, while not FAE at 50 mg/kg, significantly decreased the immobility in both TST and FST compared with the vehicle group when administered chronically; however, there were no significant differences observed between the HG and the FAE group. Chronic administration of HG failed to significantly reverse the altered crossing and rearing behavioral performance, time spent in the open arm and closed entries in the EPM, even if they showed an increased tendency, but HG significantly increased the percent of sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and decreased the immobility time in the FST. HG showed that significant increases of norepinephrine and serotonin levels and exhibited a tendency to increase the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 1A receptor mRNA, and to significantly decrease the expression of the mRNA for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). However, there were no significant differences in the expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the antidepressant-like effects of HG in a behavioral despair test and UCMS rat model, which may be associated with monoamine neurotransmitters and 5-HTT mRNA expression.",,England,2015,10.3109/13880209.2014.922586,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",BDNF and Fructus Akebiae extracts and serotonin transport protein,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25471378

When the RPE is in its normal association with the retina, light onset induces pigment granules to disperse into the apical projections; dark onset induces pigment granules to aggregate into the cell bodies. However, when the RPE is separated from the retina, pigment granule movement in the isolated RPE is insensitive to light onset. It thus seems likely that a signal from the retina communicates light onset to the RPE to initiate pigment dispersion. We have examined the nature of this retina-to-RPE signal in green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus. In isolated retinas with adherent RPE, light-induced pigment dispersion in the RPE is blocked by treatments known to block Ca2+-dependent transmitter release in the retina. In addition, the medium obtained from incubating previously dark-adapted retinas in the light induces light-adaptive pigment dispersion when added to isolated RPE. In contrast, the medium obtained from incubating dark-adapted retinas in constant darkness does not affect pigment distribution when added to isolated RPE. These results are consistent with the idea that RPE pigment dispersion is triggered by a substance that diffuses from the retina at light onset. The capacity of the conditioned medium from light-incubated retinas to induce pigment dispersion in isolated RPE is inhibited by a D2 dopamine antagonist, but not by D1 or alpha-adrenergic antagonists. Light-induced pigment dispersion in whole RPE-retinas is also blocked by a D2 dopamine antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,England,1989,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1989.tb11785.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2547905

In the absence of Ca2+ from the superfusion medium the effect of ACTH-(1-24) on the electrically stimulated release of [3H]dopamine was abolished. The stimulus-evoked release of [3H]dopamine from septal slices appeared to be modulated through dopamine receptors of the D2 subtype: the dopamine D2 receptor agonists 2-(N-propyl-N-2-thienylethylamino)-5-hydroxytetralin (N-0437) and quinpirole reduced, whereas the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride enhanced the electrically stimulated release of [3H]dopamine. The magnitude of the effect of ACTH-(1-24) on [3H]dopamine release was the same in the presence or absence of N-0437, quinpirole and sulpiride. ACTH-(1-24) had no effect on either the basal or the electrically stimulated release of [3H]noradrenaline. Also when the electrically stimulated release of [3H]noradrenaline was reduced by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the peptide was without effect. These results show that ACTH-(1-24) selectively enhances the release of [3H]dopamine from septal slices. The effect of the peptide is independent of the degree of activation of dopamine D2 receptors which modulate the stimulus-evoked release of [3H]dopamine.

Current treatments of these disorders are mostly symptomatic and inadequate, and are often associated with a number of unwanted side-effects. The striatum, the terminal region of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway, is the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia, and dopamine neurotransmission through the nigrostriatal pathway plays a crucial role in the modulation of basal ganglia output and mediated behaviors. Evidence suggests a role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin)-1A receptors in the modulation of dopamine neurotransmission and in improving pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. This review concerns the role of 5-HT1A receptors in the modulation of nigrostriatal dopamine neurotransmission, with the aim of providing guidelines for future research to improve pharmacotherapy. The current state of knowledge suggests that drugs simultaneously targeting dopamine D2 and 5-HT1A receptors may improve pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

DAT dysfunction is implicated in Parkinson's disease and depression, which are therapeutically treated by dopaminergic D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) agonists. It is, then, important to improve our understanding of interactions between D3R and DAT. We show that prolonged administration of pramipexole (0.1mg/kg/day, 6 to 21 days), a preferential D3R agonist, leads to a decrease in DA uptake in mouse striatum that reflects a reduction in DAT affinity for DA in the absence of any change in DAT density or subcellular distribution. The effect of pramipexole was absent in mice with genetically-deleted D3R (D3R(-/-)), yet unaffected in mice genetically deprived of D2R (D2R(-/-)). Pramipexole treatment induced a physical interaction between D3R and DAT, as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and in situ proximity ligation assay. Furthermore, it promoted the formation of DAT dimers and DAT association with both D2R and Î±-synuclein, effects that were abolished in D3R(-/-) mice, yet unaffected in D2R(-/-) mice, indicating dependence upon D3R. Collectively, these data suggest that prolonged treatment with dopaminergic D3 agonists provokes a reduction in DA reuptake by dopaminergic neurons related to a hitherto-unsuspected modification of the DAT interactome.

Rodents exposed to serotonin transporter (SERT)-inhibiting antidepressants during development show changes in adult emotion-like behavior. These changes have been equated with behavioral alterations arising from genetic reductions in SERT. Both models are highly relevant to humans yet they vary in their time frames of SERT disruption. We find that anxiety-related behavior and, importantly, underlying serotonin neurotransmission diverge between the two models. In mice, constitutive loss of SERT causes life-long increases in anxiety-related behavior and hyperserotonemia. Conversely, early exposure to the antidepressant escitalopram (ESC; Lexapro) results in decreased anxiety-related behavior beginning in adolescence, which is associated with adult serotonin system hypofunction in the ventral hippocampus. Adult behavioral changes resulting from early fluoxetine (Prozac) exposure were different from those of ESC and, although somewhat similar to SERT deficiency, were not associated with changes in hippocampal serotonin transmission in late adulthood. These findings reveal dissimilarities in adult behavior and neurotransmission arising from developmental exposure to different widely prescribed antidepressants that are not recapitulated by genetic SERT insufficiency.

Dopamine binds and regulates intracellular signals through D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) G-protein coupled receptors. Activation of D1- like receptors stimulates cAMP/PKA signaling via Gs mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase. In contrast, activation of D2-like receptors inhibits cAMP/PKA signaling by Gi inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. In the brain, dopamine signaling is tightly regulated by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). PDEs are a family of enzymes that selectively degrade cAMP and cGMP. There are 11 different families of PDEs that vary in their substrate specificity, kinetic properties, mode of regulation, intracellular localization, and tissue expression patterns. A number of PDE families are highly expressed in the striatum including PDE1, PDE2, PDE4, and PDE10. There is a growing amount of evidence to suggest that these enzymes play a critical role in modulating dopamine signaling and selective inhibitors of these enzymes are currently being explored as novel therapeutics to treat schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, cognitive disorders and Parkinson's disease. The aim of this review is to summarize the distinct roles of different PDEs in regulating dopamine signaling in the striatum. In addition, we will briefly review the therapeutic potential of selective PDE inhibitors to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders associated with abnormal striatal function.",,United Arab Emirates,2014,10.2174/1871524914666141226103421,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25540976

Descending cortical glutamatergic neurons regulate 5-HT neuronal activity in the midbrain raphe nuclei through Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. To analyze the functional role of GLUA1-containing AMPA receptors in serotonergic neurons, we used the Cre-ERT2/loxP-system for the conditional inactivation of the GLUA1-encoding Gria1 gene selectively in 5-HT neurons of adult mice. These Gria1(5-HT-/-) mice exhibited a distinct anxiety phenotype but showed no alterations in locomotion, depression-like behavior, or learning and memory. Increased anxiety-related behavior was associated with significant decreases in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) expression and activity, and subsequent reductions in tissue levels of 5-HT, its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and norepinephrine in the raphe nuclei. However, TPH2 expression and activity as well as monoamine levels were unchanged in the projection areas of 5-HT neurons. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings of 5-HT neurons revealed that, while Î±1-adrenoceptor-mediated excitation was unchanged, excitatory responses to AMPA were enhanced and the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated inhibitory response to 5-HT was attenuated in Gria1(5-HT-/-) mice. Our data show that a loss of GLUA1 protein in 5-HT neurons enhances AMPA receptor function and leads to multiple local molecular and neurochemical changes in the raphe nuclei that dysregulate 5-HT neuronal activity and induce anxiety-like behavior.",,England,2015,10.1038/npp.2014.332,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25547714

Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that all PCP receptors in rat brain are associated with the NMDA receptor complex. In the present study, we reexamine this hypothesis. We report that the PCP analog [3H]1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine [( 3H]TCP) labels two high affinity binding sites in membranes prepared from guinea pig brain site 1 (Kd = 14.1 nM, Bmax = 631 fmol/mg of protein) and site 2 (Kd = 46.5 nM, Bmax = 829 fmol/mg of protein).

The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques encouraged us to assess the transcriptome of the murine OE. We analyzed RNA from OEs of female and male adult mice and from fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) obtained from transgenic OMP-GFP mice. The Illumina RNA-Seq protocol was utilized to generate up to 86 million reads per transcriptome. In OE samples, nearly all OR and trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) genes involved in the perception of volatile amines were detectably expressed. Other genes known to participate in olfactory signaling pathways were among the 200 genes with the highest expression levels in the OE. To identify OE-specific genes, we compared olfactory neuron expression profiles with RNA-Seq transcriptome data from different murine tissues. By analyzing different transcript classes, we detected the expression of non-olfactory GPCRs in ORNs and established an expression ranking for GPCRs detected in the OE. We also identified other previously undescribed membrane proteins as potential new players in olfaction.

The mesocortical DA system has been implicated particularly in the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. Agonism at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with increases in cortical DA release. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex regulate mesocortical DA release through stimulation of a ""long-loop"" feedback system from the PFC to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and back. However, a causal role for VTA glutamate in the 5-HT2-induced increases in PFC DA has not been established. The present study does so by measuring 5-HT2 agonist-induced DA release in the cortex after infusions of glutamate antagonists into the VTA of the rat.

229ad94e-cae0-4093-8fc1-1363e795f884,Serotonin and alcohol: interrelationships.,Tollefson GD ,Psychopathology,,"Alcoholism is a multifaceted medicosocial problem. Recent literature discusses a common dyad, alcoholism and anxiety. Both disorders are interdigitated with the brain amine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). Direct 5-HT activation reportedly attenuates alcohol consumption, whereas depletion enhances use patterns. Acute alcohol consumption has also been associated with a transient rise, albeit eventual diminished 5-HT turnover. A variety of 5-HT models have confirmed this observation, e.g., reduced platelet 5-HT content, uptake, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Such altered characteristics of 5-HT secondary to chronic alcohol use may explain the frequent morbidity of anxiety and/or depression. Acute alcohol consumption is also associated with accumulation of the 5-HT aldehyde derivative 5-hydroxymethtryptoline. Thus, alcohol may induce the in vivo formation of aldehydes, e.g., beta-carbolines, that themselves possess high lipophilicity and psychotropic activity. Future investigation into 5-HT-specific pharmacologic probes in alcoholism will be interesting. Preliminary research has consistently demonstrated that 5-HT-enhancing agents (e.g., zimelidine or fluvoxamine) decrease alcohol consumption, preference, and short-term memory decrements. Thus, 5-HT appears to represent at least one common denominator for a spectrum of behavioral disorders including anxiety and alcoholism.",,Switzerland,1989,10.1159/000284625,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2567040

Here we examine the consequences of haploinsufficiency in the mouse integrin Î²3 subunit gene (Itgb3) on SERT function and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) effectiveness in vivo. Biochemical fractionation studies and immunofluorescent staining of murine brain slices reveal that Î±vÎ²3 receptors and SERTs are enriched in presynaptic membranes from several brain regions and that Î±vÎ²3 colocalizes with a subpopulation of SERT-containing synapses in raphe nuclei. Notably, we establish that loss of a single allele of Itgb3 in murine neurons is sufficient to decrease 5-HT uptake by SERT in midbrain synaptosomes. Pharmacological assays to elucidate the Î±vÎ²3-mediated mechanism of reduced SERT function indicate that decreased integrin Î²3 subunit expression scales down the population size of active SERT molecules and, as a consequence, lowers the effective dose of SSRIs. These data are consistent with the existence of a subpopulation of SERTs that are tightly modulated by integrin Î±vÎ²3 and significantly contribute to global SERT function at 5-HT synapses in the midbrain. Importantly, our screen of a normal human population for single nucleotide polymorphisms in human ITGB3 identified a variant associated with reductions in integrin Î²3 expression levels that parallel our mouse findings.

Neuro-anatomical investigations suggest that serotonin through the orbitofrontal-striatal circuitry may regulate behavioral domains of hyperactivity and impulsivity in ADHD. Studies from animal models of ADHD indicate intimate interplay between 5-HT and dopaminergic neurotransmission.

They impart less severe side effects in patients with no risk of addiction. Oral administration of l-tryptophan, the amino acid precursor of 5-HT, significantly alleviates ADHD symptoms.

Incorporation of 3[H]-AA into individual PL was first analyzed in accordance with a closed two-compartmental model. Apparent rates of deacylation and reacylation as well as sizes of the metabolically active PL-bound AA pools were calculated. It was found that rates of reacylation of individual PL varied markedly, while deacylation rates remained within a relatively narrow range. The rate of PI acylation was found to be the most rapid, while the rate of PS acylation was the slowest observed. The pool of PL-bound AA that is readily accessible to deacylation-reacylation processes was distributed differentially among the various PL, with more than 50% of this pool in PI; but only 0.75% of the PI content was associated with this pool. Both NE and 5HT enhanced the incorporation of 3[H]-AA into PI in a dose-related manner, while they attenuated its incorporation into other PL. Pharmacological studies indicated that the neurotransmitter effects were not mediated by known NE or 5HT receptors and that a functional presynaptic reuptake system was not required for these effects. The observed effects did not appear to be related to the formation of hydrogen peroxide by the action of MAO on the neurotransmitter. Examination of the structure-activity relationships indicated that the presence of two hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring was needed for attenuating 3[H]-AA incorporation into PC, whereas an active catechol nucleus with an additional hydroxyl group in the beta position of the side chain appeared to enhance 3[H]-AA incorporation into PI. Results obtained with the phospholipase A-2 inhibitor mepacrine and the acyltransferase inhibitor THC suggest that NE attenuates PL acylation by activating phospholipase A-2, but it concomitantly enhances PI acylation by selectively stimulating a PI-specific arachidonyl transferase via mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated.",,United States,1989,10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb22598.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2570543

The hypofunction of NMDA glutamatergic receptors induced by NMDA antagonists produces cortico-limbic hyperactivity, and this is used as an experimental model to resemble behavioural abnormalities observed in schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether injections of NMDA antagonists into the medial prefrontal cortex of the rat change (1) the increases of dopamine, noradrenaline and corticosterone concentrations produced by acute stress in amygdala, and (2) the acquisition of aversive memory related to a stressful event. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were implanted with guide cannulae to perform microdialysis and bilateral microinjections (0.5 Î¼l/side) of the NMDA antagonist 3-[(R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phophonic acid (CPP) (25 and 100 ng). Prefrontal injections were performed 60 min before restraint stress in microdialysis experiments, or training (footshock; 0.6 mA, 2 s) in inhibitory avoidance test. Retention latency was evaluated 24 h after training as an index of aversive memory. RESULTS: Acute stress increased amygdala dialysate concentrations of dopamine (160% of baseline), noradrenaline (145% of baseline) and corticosterone (170% of baseline). Prefrontal injections of CPP did not change the increases of dopamine, noradrenaline or corticosterone produced by stress. In contrast, CPP significantly reduced the retention latency in the inhibitory avoidance test.

Pb(2+) is a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and converging evidence indicates that NMDAR hypofunction has a key role in the pathophysiology of SZ. The glutamatergic hypothesis of SZ posits that NMDAR hypofunction results in the loss of parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic interneurons (PVGI) in the brain. Loss of PVGI inhibitory control to pyramidal cells alters the excitatory drive to midbrain dopamine neurons increasing subcortical dopaminergic activity. We hypothesized that if Pb(2+) exposure in early life is an environmental risk factor for SZ, it should recapitulate the loss of PVGI and reproduce subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity. We report that on postnatal day 50 (PN50), adolescence rats chronically exposed to Pb(2+) from gestation through adolescence exhibit loss of PVGI in SZ-relevant brain regions. PV and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67â€‰kDa (GAD67) protein were significantly decreased in Pb(2+) exposed rats with no apparent change in calretinin or calbindin protein levels suggesting a selective effect on the PV phenotype of GABAergic interneurons. We also show that Pb(2+) animals exhibit a heightened locomotor response to cocaine and express significantly higher levels of dopamine metabolites and D2-dopamine receptors relative to controls indicative of subcortical dopaminergic hyperactivity. Our results show that developmental Pb(2+) exposure reproduces specific neuropathology and functional dopamine system changes present in SZ.

This study investigated the role of AQP3 in the colon in morphine-induced constipation. AQP3 expression levels in the colon were analyzed after oral morphine administration to rats. The degree of constipation was analyzed after the combined administration of HgCl(2) (AQP3 inhibitor) or fluoxetine (5-HT reuptake transporter [SERT] inhibitor) and morphine. The mechanism by which morphine increased AQP3 expression was examined in HT-29 cells. AQP3 expression levels in rat colon were increased during morphine-induced constipation. The combination of HgCl(2) and morphine improved morphine-induced constipation. Treatment with morphine in HT-29 cells did not change AQP3 expression. However, 5-HT treatment significantly increased the AQP3 expression level and the nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARÎ³) 1â€‰h after treatment. Pretreatment with fluoxetine significantly suppressed these increases. Fluoxetine pretreatment suppressed the development of morphine-induced constipation and the associated increase in AQP3 expression in the colon. The results suggest that morphine increases the AQP3 expression level in the colon, which promotes water absorption from the luminal side to the vascular side and causes constipation. This study also showed that morphine-induced 5-HT secreted from the colon was taken into cells by SERT and activated PPARÎ³, which subsequently increased AQP3 expression levels.",,United States,2015,10.1093/toxsci/kfv055,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",aquaporin-3 and constipation and fluoxetine and morphine and serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25766885

The effect of mianserin on hyperalgesia occurring in connection with peripheral diabetic neuropathy was examined using the Randall-Selitto (mechanical nociceptive stimulus), Hargreaves (thermal nociceptive stimulus), and cold-plate (4Â°C, thermal nociceptive stimulus) tests. The dynamic plantar aesthesiometer, which measures the threshold values for mechanical stimuli, was used for allodynia studies. Thermal allodynia was evaluated with the warm-plate (38Â°C) test. At 30 and 45 mg/kg, mianserin effectively improved mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia occurring in connection with diabetic neuropathy. Subacute administration of mianserin also reduced diabetes-associated mechanical and thermal allodynia. The ability of mianserin to reduce diabetic neuropathic pain was comparable to that of pregabalin (10mg/kg). The antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects of mianserin were reversed with Î±-methyl-para-tyrosine methyl ester (AMPT, an inhibitor of catecholamine synthesis), phentolamine (a non-selective Î±-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (a non-selective Î²-adrenoceptor antagonist), and naloxone (a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist) administrations. The same effects were not reversed, however, by para-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA; an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis). These results suggest that the beneficial effect of mianserin on diabetic neuropathic pain is mediated through an increase in catecholamine levels in the synaptic cleft as well as through interactions with both subtypes of adrenoceptors and opioid receptors. Considering that mianserin exhibits simultaneous antidepressant and antinociceptive effects, this drug could provide a good alternative for treating the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy and the mood disorders caused directly by diabetes.",,Netherlands,2015,10.1016/j.ejphar.2015.02.048,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Adrenergic receptors and Diabetes and Mianserin and Mianserin (SID Compound CID:68551) and Neuropathy and Opioid and Pain,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25771454

Here we assessed the importance of CeM 5-HT1A receptors for anxiety in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). The lesion induced anxiety-like behaviors, increased the firing rate and burst-firing pattern of CeM Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons, as well as decreased dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala and ventral part of hippocampus (vHip). Intra-CeM injection of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT produced anxiolytic effects in the lesioned rats, and decreased the firing rate of CeM GABAergic neurons in two groups of rats. Compared to sham-operated rats, the duration of the inhibitory effect on the firing rate of GABAergic neurons was shortened in the lesioned rats. The injection increased DA levels in the mPFC and amygdala in two groups of rats and the vHip in the lesioned rats, and increased 5-HT level in the lesioned rats, whereas it decreased NA levels in the mPFC in two groups of rats and the vHip in the lesioned rats. Moreover, the mean density of 5-HT1A receptor and GABA double-labeled neurons in the CeM was reduced after the lesioning. These results suggest that activation of CeM 5-HT1A receptor produces anxiolytic effects in the 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, which involves decreased firing rate of the GABAergic neurons, and changed monoamine levels in the limbic and limbic-related brain regions.",,England,2015,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.03.007,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT(1A) receptor and Anxiety and Central nucleus of the amygdala and GABAergic neurons and In<c2><a0>vivo electrophysiology and Parkinson's disease,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25797491

The very low therapeutic efficacy of the existing conventional drugs with poor outcome may be, in part, due to uncertainty of the mechanism involved that clearly explains the existing comorbidity. The main purpose of this review was to address the sophisticated mechanisms of this comorbidity with a view of developing potential novel targets with higher efficacy and specificity. Data were collected from database searches including PubMed, references from relevant English language research/review articles and other official publications. Articles from 1990 to 2013 were included, and a broad search term criteria were followed for data mining so that relevant information was not missed out. Some of the search terms used included; diabetes-induced depression, diabetes and serotonin, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and diabetes and glucocorticoids in diabetes. Neuropathologically, depletion of brain monoaminergic activity specifically the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) system, due to chronically persisting diabetic state may lead to the mood and behavioral complications that further add on worsening the quality life years. The 5-HT system through multifunctional tasks regulates neurogenesis and plasticity and by complex receptor mechanism controls the emotional and behavioral activity. Persisting hyperglycemia leads to impaired neurogenesis, decreased synaptic plasticity, undesired neuro-anatomical alterations, neurochemical deficits, and reduced neurotransmitter activity. The neurotrophic factors and secondary messenger functions affected at molecular and genetic levels indicate the impact of diabetes-mediated dysregulation on neuronal circuits.

Its diagnosis mainly relies on the characterization of a wide range of symptoms including changes in mood and behavior. Despite the availability of antidepressant drugs, 10 to 30Â % of patients fail to respond after a single or multiple treatments, and the recurrence of depression among responsive patients is very high. Evidence from the past decades suggests that the brain neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is incriminated in MDD, and that a dysfunction of 5-HT receptors may play a role in the genesis of this disease. The 5-HT membrane transporter protein (SERT), which helps regulate the serotonergic transmission, is also implicated in MDD and is one of the main targets of antidepressant therapy. Although a number of behavioral tests and animal models have been developed to study depression, little is known about the neurobiological bases of MDD. Understanding the role of the serotonergic pathway will significantly help improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology of depression and may open up avenues for the development of new antidepressant drugs. The overarching goal of this review is to present recent findings from studies examining the serotonergic pathway in MDD, with a focus on SERT and the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A), serotonin 1B (5-HT1B), and serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors.

Depression is a common symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, its pathophysiology is unclear. Here we examined whether 5-HT6 receptors in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) involve in the regulation of PD-associated depression. Unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle in rats induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. In sham-operated rats, intra-DH injection of 5HT6 receptor agonist WAY208466 or antagonist SB258585 increased sucrose consumption and decreased immobility time, indicating the induction of antidepressant effects. In the lesioned rats, WAY208466 also produced antidepressant effects, whereas SB258585 decreased sucrose consumption and increased immobility time, indicating the induction of depressive-like behaviors. Neurochemical results showed that WAY208466 did not change dopamine (DA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), DH and habenula, and noradrenaline (NA) levels in the DH and habenula in sham-operated rats, and SB258585 increased DA and NA levels in these structures. Further, WAY208466 increased DA levels in the mPFC, DH and habenula, and NA level in the habenula in the lesioned rats, and SB258585 decreased DA levels in the mPFC and habenula. Additionally, the lesion did not change the density of neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1/5-HT6 receptor co-expressing neurons in the DH.

Previous human and animal studies suggested an association between 14-3-3 dysregulation and schizophrenia. METHODS: We characterized behavioral and functional changes in transgenic mice that express an isoform-independent 14-3-3 inhibitor peptide in the brain. RESULTS: We recently showed that 14-3-3 functional knockout mice (FKO) exhibit impairments in associative learning and memory. We report here that these 14-3-3 FKO mice display other behavioral deficits that correspond to the core symptoms of schizophrenia. These behavioral deficits may be attributed to alterations in multiple neurotransmission systems in the 14-3-3 FKO mice. In particular, inhibition of 14-3-3 proteins results in a reduction of dendritic complexity and spine density in forebrain excitatory neurons, which may underlie the altered synaptic connectivity in the prefrontal cortical synapse of the 14-3-3 FKO mice. At the molecular level, this dendritic spine defect may stem from dysregulated actin dynamics secondary to a disruption of the 14-3-3-dependent regulation of phosphorylated cofilin.

Reduced morphine reward in 118GG mice was associated with decreased dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and reduced effects on GABA release in the ventral tegmental area that were not due to changes in drug potency or efficacy in vitro or receptor-binding affinity. Fewer MOR-binding sites were observed in h/mOPRM1-118GG mice, and pharmacological reduction of MOR availability unmasked genotypic differences in fentanyl sensitivity.

Most strikingly, AMPA receptors associated with this TARP have a relatively high localization in the hippocampus. TARP Î³-8 also modifies the pharmacology and trafficking of AMPA receptors. However, to date there is little understanding of the biological significance of this auxiliary protein. In the present set of studies we provide a characterization of the differential pharmacology and behavioral consequences of deletion of TARP Î³-8 by comparing the wild type (WT) and Î³-8 -/- (knock-out, KO) mouse. KO mice were mildly hyperactive in a locomotor arena but not in other environments compared to WT mice. Additionally, the KO mice demonstrated enhanced locomotor stimulatory effects of both d-amphetamine and phencyclidine. Marble-burying and digging behaviors were dramatically reduced in KO mice. In another assay that can detect anxiety-like phenotypes, the elevated plus maze, no differences were observed in overall movement or open arm entries. In the forced-swim assay, KO mice displayed decreases in immobility time like the antidepressant imipramine and the AMPA receptor potentiator, LY392098. In KO mice, the antidepressant-like effects of LY392098 were prevented whereas the effects of imipramine were unaffected. Convulsions were induced by pentylenetetrazole, N-methyl-D-aspartate, and by kainic acid. However, in KO mice, kainic acid produced less tonic convulsions and lethality. KO mice had reduced levels of norepinephrine in hippocampus and cerebellum but not in hypothalamus or prefrontal cortex, decreased levels of cAMP in hippocampus, and increased levels of acetylcholine in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex. KO mice displayed decreased turnover of dopamine and increased histamine turnover in multiple brain areas In contrast, serotonin and its metabolites were not significantly affected by deletion of the Î³-8 protein. Of a large panel of plasma lipids, only two monoacylglycerols (1OG and 2OG) were marginally but nonsignificantly altered in WT vs KO mice. Overall, the data suggest genetic inactivation of this specific population of AMPA receptors results in modest changes in behavior characterized by a mild hyperactivity which is condition dependent and a marked reduction in digging and burying behaviors. Despite deletion of TARP Î³-8, chemoconvulsants were still active. Consistent with their predicted pharmacological actions, the convulsant effects of kainate and the antidepressant-like effects of an AMPA receptor potentiator (both acting upon AMPA receptors) were reduced or absent in KO mice.",,United Arab Emirates,2015,10.2174/1871527314666150429114818,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25921737

Serotonin supplementation studies suggest that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce impulsive aggression in some adults but are less effective in adults with pathological aggression and also in children and adolescents. Child and adolescent studies are less conclusive, in part due to the heterogeneous physiologic and psychosocial changes occurring over the course of development.

856b93d4-56a5-4b89-bcca-f26c25fd82fe,Role of the 5-HT4 receptor in chronic fluoxetine treatment-induced neurogenic activity and granule cell dematuration in the dentate gyrus.,Imoto Y and Kira T and Sukeno M and Nishitani N and Nagayasu K and Nakagawa T and Kaneko S and Kobayashi K and Segi-Nishida E ,Molecular brain,,"BACKGROUND: Chronic treatment with selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) facilitates adult neurogenesis and reverses the state of maturation in mature granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Recent studies have suggested that the 5-HT4 receptor is involved in both effects. However, it is largely unknown how the 5-HT4 receptor mediates neurogenic effects in the DG and, how the neurogenic and dematuration effects of SSRIs interact with each other. RESULTS: We addressed these issues using 5-HT4 receptor knockout (5-HT4R KO) mice. Expression of the 5-HT4 receptor was detected in mature GCs but not in neuronal progenitors of the DG. We found that chronic treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine significantly increased cell proliferation and the number of doublecortin-positive cells in the DG of wild-type mice, but not in 5-HT4R KO mice. We then examined the correlation between the increased neurogenesis and the dematuration of GCs. As reported previously, reduced expression of calbindin in the DG, as an index of dematuration, by chronic fluoxetine treatment was observed in wild-type mice but not in 5-HT4R KO mice. The proliferative effect of fluoxetine was inversely correlated with the expression level of calbindin in the DG. The expression of neurogenic factors in the DG, such as brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), was also associated with the progression of dematuration. These results indicate that the neurogenic effects of fluoxetine in the DG are closely associated with the progression of dematuration of GCs. In contrast, the DG in which neurogenesis was impaired by irradiation still showed significant reduction of calbindin expression by chronic fluoxetine treatment, suggesting that dematuration of GCs by fluoxetine does not require adult neurogenesis in the DG. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the 5-HT4 receptor plays an important role in fluoxetine-induced adult neurogenesis in the DG in addition to GC dematuration, and that these phenomena are closely associated. Our results suggest that 5-HT4 receptor-mediated phenotypic changes, including dematuration in mature GCs, underlie the neurogenic effect of SSRIs in the DG, providing new insight into the cellular mechanisms of the neurogenic actions of SSRIs in the hippocampus.",,England,2015,10.1186/s13041-015-0120-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-25976618

The protective role of an enriched condition (EC) against psychogenic stressors in various animal models has been well documented. However, this condition has not been tested in field mice in the context of PTSD. In this study, we show that field mice (Mus booduga) housed under EC exhibit predominantly proactive and less reactive behavior compared with mice housed under standard conditions (SC) during exposure to their natural predator (field rat Rattus rattus). Furthermore, we observed that EC mice displayed less anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and light/dark-box after exposure to the predator (7 hrs/7 days). In EC mice, predator exposure elevated the level of serotonin (5-Hydroxytrypamine, [5-HT]) in the amygdala as part of the coping response. Subsequently, the serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT1A receptor were up-regulated significantly, but the same did not occur in the 5-HT2C receptor, which is associated with the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-II (CaMKII) and a transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Our results show that predator exposure induced the activation of CaMKII/CREB, which is accompanied with increased levels of histone acetylation (H3, H4) and decreased histone deacetylases (HDAC1, 2). Subsequently, in the amygdala, the transcription of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 receptor were up-regulated, whereas the Y2 receptor was down-regulated. Therefore, EC facilitated a coping response against a fear associated cue in a PTSD animal model and reduced anxiety by differentially activating serotonergic and NPY-ergic systems.",,United States,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0127945,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26016844

Amyloid-beta represents a neurotoxic proteolytic cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein. The progressive cognitive decline that is associated with Alzheimer's disease has been mainly attributed to a deficit in cholinergic neurotransmission due to the continuous degeneration of cholinergic neurons e.g. in the basal forebrain. There is evidence suggesting that other neurotransmitter systems including neuronal histamine also contribute to the development and maintenance of Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive deficits. Pathological changes in the neuronal histaminergic system of such patients are highly predictive of ensuing cognitive deficits. Furthermore, histamine-related drugs, including histamine 3 receptor antagonists, have been demonstrated to alleviate cognitive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease. This review summarizes findings from animal and clinical research on the relationship between the neuronal histaminergic system and cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's disease. The significance of the neuronal histaminergic system as a promising target for the development of more effective drugs for the treatment of cognitive symptoms is discussed. Furthermore, the option to use histamine-related agents as neurogenesis-stimulating therapy that counteracts progressive brain atrophy in Alzheimer's disease is considered.

However, clinical application of cannabinoid ligands has been hampered owing to their adverse on-target effects. Ligand-biased signaling from, and allosteric modulation of, CB1Rs offer pharmacological approaches that may enable the development of improved CB1R drugs, through modulation of only therapeutically desirable CB1R signaling pathways. There is growing evidence that CB1Rs are subject to ligand-biased signaling and allosterism. Therefore, in the present study, we quantified ligand-biased signaling and allosteric modulation at CB1Rs. Cannabinoid agonists displayed distinct biased signaling profiles at CB1Rs. For instance, whereas 2-arachidonylglycerol and WIN55,212-2 [(R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone] showed little preference for inhibition of cAMP and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2), N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), methanandamide, CP55940 [2-[(1R,2R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]-5-(2-methyloctan-2-yl)phenol], and HU-210 [11-hydroxy-Î”(8)-THC-dimethylheptyl] were biased toward cAMP inhibition. The small-molecule allosteric modulator Org27569 [5-chloro-3-ethyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid [2-(4-piperidin-1-yl-phenyl)ethyl]amide] displayed biased allosteric effects by blocking cAMP inhibition mediated by all cannabinoid ligands tested, at the same time having little or no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated by a subset of these ligands. Org27569 also displayed negative binding cooperativity with [(3)H]SR141716A [5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide]; however, it had minimal effects on binding of cannabinoid agonists. Furthermore, we highlight the need to validate the reported allosteric effects of the endogenous ligands lipoxin A4 and pregnenolone at CB1Rs. Pregnenolone but not lipoxin A4 displaced [(3)H]SR141716A, but there was no functional interaction between either of these ligands and cannabinoid agonists.

Administration of estradiol and perphenazine (to stimulate endogenous prolactin release) to castrated rats restored tumor growth and contents of Pu and Sd to control values in a time dependent fashion while Sm levels were only modestly raised. The hormonal modulation of tumor polyamine levels was particularly obvious when the treatment effects on total pools (i.e. Pu + Sd + Sm) were analyzed. No significant correlation was observed between ER and PgR and polyamines in the tumors of intact rats as well as most of the treated groups.

We hypothesize that proper DA neurotransmission is therefore dependent upon intact neuronal Akt function. Akt is activated by phosphorylation of two key residues: Thr308 and Ser473. Blunted Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (pAkt-473) has been observed in lymphocytes and postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients, and psychosis-prone normal individuals. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 (mTORC2) is a multiprotein complex that is responsible for phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (pAkt-473). We demonstrate that mice with disrupted mTORC2 signaling in brain exhibit altered striatal DA-dependent behaviors, such as increased basal locomotion, stereotypic counts, and exaggerated response to the psychomotor effects of amphetamine (AMPH). Combining in vivo and ex vivo pharmacological, electrophysiological, and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that the changes in striatal DA neurotransmission and associated behaviors are caused, at least in part, by elevated D2 DA receptor (D2R) expression and upregulated ERK1/2 activation. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic and D2R blocker, reduced AMPH hypersensitivity and elevated pERK1/2 to the levels of control animals. By viral gene delivery, we downregulated mTORC2 solely in the dorsal striatum of adult wild-type mice, demonstrating that striatal mTORC2 regulates AMPH-stimulated behaviors.

Our previous investigations in crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) have established that stress induces changes in brain serotonin (5-HT) concentrations that are responsible for the appearance of anxiety-like behavior (ALB). Here, we further analyze the roles of 5-HT and another biogenic amine, dopamine (DA), on the crayfish response to stress. We show that the intensity of crayfish ALB depends on the intensity of stressful stimulation and is associated with increased concentrations of 5-HT in the brain. These 5-HT levels were significantly correlated, before, as well as after stress, with those of DA, which were approximately 3- to 5-times less abundant. However, whereas the degree of ALB was clearly correlated with brain 5-HT concentrations, it was not significantly correlated with DA. Moreover, in contrast to injections of 5-HT, DA injections were not able to elicit a stress response or ALB. In addition, 5-HT and DA levels were not modified by treatment with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide, confirming that suppression of ALB by this GABA-A receptor ligand acts downstream and is independent of changes in crayfish bioamine levels. Our study also provides evidence that the anxiogenic effect of 5-HT injections can be prevented by a preliminary injection of 5-HT antagonists. Altogether, our results emphasize that the rises in brain concentrations of 5-HT, but not DA, play a role in controlling the induction and the intensity of crayfish ALB.",,England,2015,10.1242/jeb.120550,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT and Anxiety and Benzodiazepines and Crustacea and GABA and Octapamine,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26139659

The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which contains the majority of forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons, is implicated in the control of anxiety states and anxiety-related behavior via neuromodulatory effects on these networks. Relaxin-3 is the native neuropeptide ligand for the Gi/o-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP3, and is primarily expressed in the nucleus incertus (NI), a tegmental region immediately caudal to the DR. RXFP3 activation has been shown to modulate anxiety-related behavior in rodents, and RXFP3 mRNA is expressed in the DR. In this study, we examined the response of relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and serotonergic neurons in the DR following pharmacologically induced anxiety and exposure to an aversive environment. We administered the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 or vehicle to adult male Wistar rats and, 30 min later, exposed them to either the elevated plus-maze or home cage control conditions. Immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos was used to determine activation of serotonergic neurons in the DR and relaxin-3 neurons in the NI, measured 2h following drug injection. Analysis revealed that FG-7142 administration and exposure to the elevated plus-maze are both associated with an increase in c-Fos expression in relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and in serotonergic neurons in dorsal and ventrolateral regions of the DR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that relaxin-3 systems in the NI and serotonin systems in the DR interact to form part of a network involved in the control of anxiety-related behavior.",,United States,2015,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.052,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",anxiety and dorsal raphe nucleus and elevated plus-maze and nucleus incertus and relaxin-3 and serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26141847

In vertebrates, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons play an important role in the control of reproduction. To elucidate the neuroendocrine mechanisms of SSRI-induced reproductive failure, we examined the neuronal association between 5-HT and GnRH (GnRH2 and GnRH3) systems in the male zebrafish. Double-label immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy followed by three-dimensional construction analysis showed close associations between 5-HT fibers with GnRH3 fibers and preoptic-GnRH3 cell bodies, but there was no association with GnRH2 cell bodies and fibers. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that short-term treatment (2 wk) with low to medium doses (4 and 40 Î¼g/L, respectively) of citalopram significantly decreased mRNA levels of gnrh3, gonadotropins (lhb and fshb) and 5-HT-related genes (tph2 and sert) in the male zebrafish.

We used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic increases in NAc dopamine resulting from electrical stimulation of dopamine cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Systemic LiCl injection reduced electrically evoked dopamine release in the NAc of both anesthetized and awake rats.

Indeed, peripheral pretreatment with the GLP-1R antagonist exendin-9 (Ex-9) potently attenuated the LiCl-induced suppression of dopamine. Pretreatment with Ex-9 did not, however, affect the suppression of phasic dopamine release by the kappa-opioid receptor agonist, salvinorin A, supporting a selective effect of GLP-1R stimulation in LiCl-induced dopamine suppression.

Intracellular recordings were made from neurones in the nucleus accumbens in slices from the rat brain maintained in vitro. 2. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT.1-100 microM) depolarized 170 of 203 (84%) neurones and caused them to discharge action potentials. The depolarization was associated with an increase in the input resistance, and was reversed in polarity by conditioning hyperpolarization; this reversal potential was linearly related to the logarithm of the extracellular potassium concentration. 3. Application of 5-HT to neurones voltage-clamped near their resting potential (typically about -80 mV) caused an inward current and a decrease in the slope conductance. The current caused by 5-HT reversed polarity at the potassium equilibrium potential. Analysis with an equivalent circuit model of the neurone at steady state indicated that 5-HT selectively reduced the inward rectifier potassium conductance. 4.

The present study examined the influence of UCMS on the thermal pain sensitivity and antinociceptive effects of two opioid analgesics, morphine (an agonist of opioid receptors) and tramadol (an agonist of Î¼-opioid receptor and an inhibitor of both noradrenaline and serotonin transporters). We also examined the effects of pretreatment with maprotiline (a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) and escitalopram (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) on the antinociceptive action of morphine in mice under an UCMS condition. RESULTS: Unpredictable chronic mild stress did not affect the basal thermal pain sensitivity in a mouse hot-plate test. Although morphine dose-dependently induced thermal antinociceptive effects under both the UCMS and non-stress conditions, the thermal antinociceptive effect of 3 mg/kg morphine under the UCMS condition was significantly lower than under the non-stressed condition. Unlike the case with morphine, we observed no significant difference in the thermal antinociceptive effect of tramadol between the UCMS and non-stress conditions. Furthermore, the reduced thermal antinociceptive effect of 3 mg/kg morphine under the UCMS condition was significantly ameliorated by pretreatment with 10 mg/kg maprotiline but not 3 mg/kg escitalopram. Pretreatment with neither maprotiline nor escitalopram alone was associated with an antinociceptive effect under either condition. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the antinociceptive effect of morphine but not tramadol was reduced in mice that had experienced UCMS. The reduced antinociceptive effect of morphine under the UCMS condition was ameliorated by pretreatment with maprotiline but not escitalopram.

The H3R receptor, which is expressed primarily in the central nervous system, is a promising pharmacotherapeutic target. Recent evidence for a contribution of histamine dysregulation to Tourette syndrome and tic disorders is particularly strong; although specific mutations in histamine-associated genes are rare, they have led to informative studies in animal models that may pave the way for therapeutic advances. A controlled study of an H3R antagonist in Tourette syndrome is ongoing. Preclinical studies of H3R antagonists in schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, and narcolepsy have all shown promise. Recently reported controlled studies have been disappointing in schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, but the H3R antagonist pitolisant shows promise in the treatment of narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness and is currently under regulatory review for these conditions.

Alterations in 5-HT levels during the early period of life may signal to feeding behavior and hypothalamic genic expression changes in adulthood. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effects of hypercaloric diet in adult rats submitted to neonatal serotonin reuptake inhibition on food intake, fat pad mass, plasmatic triglycerides/cholesterol and gene expression of hypothalamic peptides (POMC, NPY) and serotonin receptors (5-HT1B, 5-HT2C). METHODS: In each litter, 8 pups were divided into two groups: control (C) and fluoxetine (F). From the 1(st) to the 21(st) postnatal day, C pups received sterile saline while F pups received fluoxetine (10mg/kg). From 180 to 215 days, a group of rats from C and F groups were fed hypercaloric diet (CH and FH, 421.4Kcal/100 g) while the rest of animals from C and F groups fed chow diet (CC and FC). RESULTS: The use of hypercaloric diet was associated with lower accumulation of white adipose tissue in adult rats subjected to neonatal serotonin reuptake inhibition. Adult rats of group FC showed decreased 5-HT2C and neuropeptide Y mRNA expression compared with control chow diet group (CC). After chronic use of a hypercaloric diet, the expression of 5-HT2C was higher in the FH group than the FC group and neuropeptide Y expression decreased in FH related to FC.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of 5-HT uptake inhibitors, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine and clomipramine (CLM), and amphetamine derivatives, p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) and methamphetamine (MET), on endogenous 5-HT outflow from the isolated chick thoracic aorta in vitro. 5-HT was measured by using a HPLC system with electrochemical detection. The amphetamine derivatives and 5-HT uptake inhibitors caused concentration-dependent increases in endogenous 5-HT outflow. PCA was about ten times more effective in eliciting 5-HT outflow than MET. The 5-HT uptake inhibitors examined had similar potency for 5-HT outflow. PCA and CLM increased 5-HT outflow in a temperature-dependent manner. The outflow of 5-HT induced by PCA or 5-HT uptake inhibitors was independent of extracellular Ca(2+) concentration. The 5-HT outflow induced by CLM, but not that by PCA, was dependent on the extracellular NaCl concentration. These results suggest that the 5-HT uptake system of 5-HT-containing chemoreceptor cells in the chicken thoracic aorta has characteristics similar to those of 5-HT-containing neurons in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).",,Japan,2016,10.1292/jvms.15-0146,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26321443

The effects of atypical APDs to enhance rodent cortical, hippocampal, limbic, and dorsal striatal (dSTR) DA and acetylcholine (ACh) release, contribute to their ability to improve novel object recognition (NOR) in rodents treated with sub-chronic (sc) phencyclidine (PCP) and cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). Here we determined the ability of blonanserin, the D3 antagonist NGB 2904, and the typical APD, haloperidol, a D2 antagonist, to enhance neurotransmitter efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dSTR of mice, and to ameliorate the scPCP-induced deficit in NOR in rats.

While the degeneration of MbDNs underlies the motor defects in Parkinson's disease, imbalances in dopamine levels are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and substance abuse. In recent years, progress has been made in understanding how MbDNs, which constitute a relatively small neuronal population in the brain, can contribute to such diverse functions and dysfunctions. In particular, important insights have been gained regarding the distinct molecular, neurochemical and network properties of MbDNs. How this diversity of MbDNs is established during brain development is only starting to be unraveled. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the diversity in MbDN progenitors and differentiated MbDNs in the developing rodent brain. We discuss the signaling pathways, transcription factors and transmembrane receptors that contribute to setting up these diverse MbDN subpopulations.

Evidence suggests that brain serotonergic deficits are associated with depressive-like behavior in diabetes and that 5HT3 receptor (5HT3R) antagonists have serotonergic facilitatory effects. This study examined the effects of a novel 5HT3R antagonist, 4i (N-(3-chloro-2-methylphenyl)quinoxalin-2-carboxamide), in diabetes-induced depressive phenotypes. Experimentally, (1) to evaluate the effects of 4i, mice with 8-weeks of diabetes (induced by streptozotocin, 200mg/kg, i.p.) were treated with vehicle, 4i (0.5 and 1mg/kg/day, i.p.), fluoxetine (10mg/kg/day, i.p.) for 4-weeks and subjected to neurobehavioral assays, followed by biochemical estimation of serotonin levels in midbrain, prefrontal-cortex and cerebellum.

The results showed that diabetic mice exhibited a significant behavioral deficit, including depression-like behavior in forced swim test, anxiety-like in open field test and sociability deficits in social interaction test, along with a significant decrease in serotonin level in these brain regions. 4i (1mg/kg), similar to fluoxetine, prevented these behavioral abnormalities and normalized brain serotonin levels. 4i (0.5mg/kg) ameliorated only diabetes-induced depressive-like behavior and serotonin deficits, but not anxiety-like effects. mCPBG blunted 4i-mediated behavioral response and increase in brain serotonin levels. Altogether, this study suggests that 4i prevents diabetes-induced depressive phenotypes in mice, which may involve antagonism of 5HT3Rs and increase in serotonin levels in discrete brain regions.",,Netherlands,2016,10.1016/j.bbr.2015.10.007,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5HT(3) receptor antagonist and Depressive phenotypes and Diabetes and Forced swim test and Open field test and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26454237

The lesion induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-PrL injection of 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS19 (0.5, 1 and 2 Î¼g/rat) increased sucrose consumption, and decreased immobility time in sham-operated and the lesioned rats, indicating the induction of antidepressant-like effects. Further, intra-PrL injection of 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB269970 (1.5, 3 and 6 Î¼g/rat) decreased sucrose consumption, and increased immobility time, indicating the induction of depressive-like responses. However, the doses producing these effects in the lesioned rats were higher than those in sham-operated rats.

Intense stress promotes PTSD, which has been associated with exaggerated startle and deficient sensorimotor gating. Here, we examined the long-term sequelae of a rodent model of traumatic stress (repeated predator exposure) on amygdala systems that modulate startle and prepulse inhibition (PPI), an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. We show in rodents that repeated psychogenic stress (predator) induces long-lasting sensitization of basolateral amygdala (BLA) noradrenergic (NE) receptors (Î±1) via a corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRF-R1)-dependent mechanism, and that these CRF1 and NE Î±1 receptors are highly colocalized on presumptive excitatory output projection neurons of the BLA. A profile identical to that seen with predator exposure was produced in nonstressed rats by intra-BLA infusions of CRF (200 ng/0.5 Î¼l), but not by repeated NE infusions (20 Î¼g/0.5 Î¼l). Infusions into the adjacent central nucleus of amygdala had no effect. Importantly, the predator stress- or CRF-induced sensitization of BLA manifested as heightened startle and PPI deficits in response to subsequent subthreshold NE system challenges (with intra-BLA infusions of 0.3 Î¼g/0.5 Î¼l NE), up to 1 month after stress. This profile of effects closely resembles aspects of PTSD. Hence, we reveal a discrete neural pathway mediating the enhancement of NE system function seen in PTSD, and we offer a model for characterizing potential new treatments that may work by modulating this BLA circuitry. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The present findings reveal a novel and discrete neural substrate that could underlie certain core deficits (startle and prepulse inhibition) that are observed in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is shown here that repeated exposure to a rodent model of traumatic stress (predator exposure) produces a long-lasting sensitization of basolateral amygdala noradrenergic substrates [via a corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-dependent mechanism] that regulate startle, which is exaggerated in PTSD. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the sensitized noradrenergic receptors colocalize with CRF1 receptors on output projection neurons of the basolateral amygdala. Hence, this stress-induced sensitization of noradrenergic receptors on basolateral nucleus efferents has wide-ranging implications for the numerous deleterious sequelae of trauma exposure that are seen in multiple psychiatric illnesses, including PTSD.",,United States,2015,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5080-14.2015,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",corticotropin-releasing factor and corticotropin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic and prepulse inhibition and schizophrenia and sensorimotor gating,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26490866

Pathological hallmarks of PD are the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the accumulation of alpha-synuclein, however also being present in the serotonergic raphe nuclei early in the disease course. The dysfunction of the serotonergic system projecting to the hippocampus may contribute to early non-motor symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), a unique niche of the forebrain continuously generating new neurons, may particularly present enhanced susceptibility towards accumulating alpha-synuclein levels. The underlying molecular mechanisms in the context of neuronal maturation and survival of new-born neurons are yet not well understood. To characterize the effects of overexpression of human full-length alpha-synuclein on hippocampal cellular and synaptic plasticity, we used a recently generated BAC alpha-synuclein transgenic rat model showing important features of PD such as widespread and progressive alpha-synuclein aggregation pathology, dopamine loss and age-dependent motor decline. At the age of four months, thus prior to the occurrence of the motor phenotype, we observed a profoundly impaired dendritogenesis of neuroblasts in the hippocampal DG resulting in severely reduced survival of adult new-born neurons. Diminished neurogenesis concurred with a serotonergic deficit in the hippocampus as defined by reduced levels of serotonin (5-HT) 1B receptor, decreased 5-HT neurotransmitter levels, and a loss of serotonergic nerve terminals innervating the DG/CA3 subfield, while the number of serotonergic neurons in the raphe nuclei remained unchanged. Moreover, alpha-synuclein overexpression reduced proteins involved in vesicle release, in particular synapsin-1 and Rab3 interacting molecule (RIM3), in conjunction with an altered ultrastructural architecture of hippocampal synapses. Importantly, BAC alpha-synuclein rats showed an early anxiety-like phenotype consisting of reduced exploratory behavior and feeding. Taken together, these findings imply that accumulating alpha-synuclein severely affects hippocampal neurogenesis paralleled by impaired 5-HT neurotransmission prior to the onset of aggregation pathology and overt motor deficits in this transgenic rat model of PD.",,United States,2016,10.1016/j.nbd.2015.10.021,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT and Alpha-synuclein and Dendritogenesis and Hippocampus and Neurogenesis and Parkinson's disease and Synapse,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26523794

Evidence suggests a positive and bidirectional association between obesity and depression. It is now well established that central serotonergic system is involved in the elicitation of satiety signal and elevation of mood. Drugs that increase serotonin neurotransmission are commonly recommended for the treatment of depression. But many patients are not benefitted by these drugs, while remission rate is also not satisfactory. Serotonin based antiobesity drugs have been either withdrawn from the market or disapproved for long term use. In view of critical need for novel therapeutic targets for obesity and depression, the role of leptin is becoming increasingly important. The peptide hormone secreted by adipocytes can cross blood brain barriers to elicit satiety signal via its receptors in the hypothalamus. Emerging evidence suggests that the peptide hormone has a role in responses to stress and produces antidepressant like effects. On the other hand, both obesity and depression are often associated with higher levels of leptin in circulation suggesting insensitivity to leptin. The aim of the present article is to draw research interest towards exploring mechanism involved in leptin resistance.

Loss of dysbindin-1 modifies cellular trafficking of dopamine (DA) D2 receptors to increase cell surface expression, but its influence upon signaling has never been characterized. Further, the effects of dysbindin-1 upon closely related D3 receptors remain unexplored. Hence, we examined the impact of dysbindin-1 (isoform A) co-expression on the localization and coupling of human D2L and D3 receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary or SH-SY5Y cells lacking endogenous dysbindin-1. Dysbindin-1 co-transfection decreased cell surface expression of both D3 and D2L receptors. Further, while their affinity for DA was unchanged, dysbindin-1 reduced the magnitude and potency of DA-induced adenylate cylase recruitment/cAMP production. Dysbindin-1 also blunted the amplitude of DA-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt at both D2L and D3 receptors without, in contrast to cAMP, affecting the potency of DA. Interference with calveolin/clathrin-mediated processes of internalization prevented the modification by dysbindin-1 of ERK1/2 and adenylyl cyclase stimulation at D2L and D3 receptors. Finally, underpinning the specificity of the influence of dysbindin-1 on D2L and D3 receptors, dysbindin-1 did not modify recruitment of adenylyl cyclase by D1 receptors. These observations demonstrate that dysbindin-1 influences cell surface expression of D3 in addition to D2L receptors, and that it modulates activation of their signaling pathways. Accordingly, both a deficiency and an excess of dysbindin-1 may be disruptive for dopaminergic transmission, supporting its link to schizophrenia and other CNS disorders. Dysbindin-1, a candidate gene for schizophrenia, alters D2 receptors cell surface expression. We demonstrate that dysbindin-1 expression also influences cell surface levels of D3 receptors. Further, Dysbindin-1 reduces DA-induced adenylate cylase recruitment/cAMP production and modifies major signaling pathways (Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2)) of both D2 and D3 receptors. Dysbindin-1 modulates thus D2 and D3 receptor signaling, supporting a link to schizophrenia.",,England,2016,10.1111/jnc.13501,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D2 receptor and D3 receptor and dopamine and dysbindin-1 and internalization and schizophrenia,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26685100

We recently found that prenatal VPA exposure causes a reduction of dopaminergic activity in the prefrontal cortex of male, but not female, mice. This suggests that reduced prefrontal dopaminergic activity is associated with behavioral abnormalities in VPA-treated mice. In the present study, we examined whether the attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs methylphenidate and atomoxetine (which increase dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not striatum, in mice) could alleviate the behavioral abnormalities and changes in dendritic spine morphology induced by prenatal VPA exposure. We found that methylphenidate and atomoxetine increased prefrontal dopamine and noradrenaline release in VPA-treated mice. Acute treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine did not alleviate the social interaction deficits or recognition memory impairment in VPA-treated mice, while chronic treatment for 2 weeks did. Methylphenidate or atomoxetine for 2 weeks also improved the prenatal VPA-induced decrease in dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex. The effects of these drugs on behaviors and dendritic spine morphology were antagonized by concomitant treatment with the dopamine-D1 receptor antagonist SCH39166 or the dopamine-D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, but not by the Î±2 -adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with methylphenidate or atomoxetine improves abnormal behaviors and diminishes the reduction in spine density in VPA-treated mice via a prefrontal dopaminergic system-dependent mechanism.

In this paper, we propose that the pharmacology of MDMA, the primary psychoactive component of ecstasy tablets, changes markedly with repeated exposure and that neuroadaptations in dopamine and serotonin brain systems underlie the shift from MDMA use to MDMA misuse in susceptible subjects. Data from both the human and laboratory animal literature are synthesized to support the idea that (1) MDMA becomes a less efficacious serotonin releaser and a more efficacious dopamine releaser with the development of behaviour consistent with an SUD and (2) that upregulated serotonin receptor mechanisms contribute to the development of the MDMA SUD via dysregulated inhibitory control associated with the trait of impulsivity.",,Germany,2017,10.1007/7854_2015_421,Journal Article,Dopamine and Ecstasy and Impulsivity and Inhibitory control and MDMA and Serotonin and Substance use disorder,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26718587

GLP-1 agonists are in clinical use for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLP-1, however, may also affect brain areas associated with emotionality regulation. Here we aimed to characterize acute and chronic impact of GLP-1 on anxiety and depression-like behavior. Rats were subjected to anxiety and depression behavior tests following acute or chronic intracerebroventricular or intra-dorsal raphe (DR) application of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Serotonin or serotonin-related genes were also measured in the amygdala, DR and the hippocampus. We demonstrate that both GLP-1 and its long lasting analog, Exendin-4, induce anxiety-like behavior in three rodent tests of this behavior: black and white box, elevated plus maze and open field test when acutely administered intraperitoneally, into the lateral ventricle, or directly into the DR. Acute central GLP-1 receptor stimulation also altered serotonin signaling in the amygdala. In contrast, chronic central administration of Exendin-4 did not alter anxiety-like behavior but significantly reduced depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. Importantly, this positive effect of Exendin-4 was not due to significant body weight loss and reduced food intake, since rats pair-fed to Exendin-4 rats did not show altered mood. Collectively we show a striking impact of central GLP-1 on emotionality and the amygdala serotonin signaling that is divergent under acute versus chronic GLP-1 activation conditions. We also find a novel role for the DR GLP-1 receptors in regulation of behavior. These results may have direct relevance to the clinic, and indicate that Exendin-4 may be especially useful for obese patients manifesting with comorbid depression.",,England,2016,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.021,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Anxiety and Depression and Exendin-4 and Food intake and GLP-1 and Obesity,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26724568

Recent advances reveal that susceptibility to obesity can be programmed by maternal and neonatal nutrition. Specifically, a maternal low-protein diet during pregnancy causes decreased intrauterine growth, rapid postnatal catch-up growth and an increased risk for diet-induced obesity. Given that the synthesis of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is nutritionally regulated and 5-HT is a trophic factor, we hypothesised that maternal diet influences fetal 5-HT exposure, which then influences development of the central appetite network and the subsequent efficacy of 5-HT to control energy balance in later life. Consistent with our hypothesis, pregnant rats fed a low-protein diet exhibited elevated serum levels of 5-HT, which was also evident in the placenta and fetal brains at embryonic day 16.5. This increase was associated with reduced levels of 5-HT2CR, the primary 5-HT receptor influencing appetite, in the fetal, neonatal and adult hypothalamus. As expected, a reduction of 5-HT2CR was associated with impaired sensitivity to 5-HT-mediated appetite suppression in adulthood. 5-HT primarily achieves effects on appetite by 5-HT2CR stimulation of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) peptides within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). We show that 5-HT2ARs are also anatomically positioned to influence the activity of ARC POMC neurons and that mRNA encoding 5-HT2AR is increased in the hypothalamus ofin uterogrowth-restricted offspring that underwent rapid postnatal catch-up growth. Furthermore, these animals at 3Â months of age are more sensitive to appetite suppression induced by 5-HT2AR agonists. These findings not only reveal a 5-HT-mediated mechanism underlying the programming of susceptibility to obesity, but also provide a promising means to correct it, by treatment with a 5-HT2AR agonist.",,England,2016,10.1242/dmm.023903,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Developmental programming and Hypothalamus and Low birth weight and Maternal diet and Protein restriction and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26769798

Although many advances in this field have addressed certain aspects of disease progression and pain management, new approaches to treatment are required. This review focuses on the influence of tryptophan, its metabolites and their influence on bone remodeling. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, melatonin, kynurenines and niacin. Changes of tryptophan levels were noticed in bone metabolic diseases. Moreover, some works indicate that tryptophan plays a role in osteoblastic differentiation. Serotonin can exert different effects on bones, which depend on site of serotonin synthesis. Gut-derived serotonin inhibits bone formation, whereas brain-derived serotonin enhances bone formation and decreases bone resorption. Melatonin, increased differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblastic cell lineage. Results of melatonin action on bone are anabolic and antiresorptive. Activation of the second tryptophan metabolic pathway, the kynurenine pathway, is associated with osteoblastogenesis and can be implicated in the occurrence of bone diseases. Oxidation products like kynurenine stopped proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. This may result in inhibition of osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation. Kynurenic acid acts as an antagonist at glutamate receptors, which are expressed on osteoclasts. Quinolinic acid activates N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid exhibits pro-oxidant and antioxidant activity. Decreased concentration of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid can be one of the causes of osteoporosis. 3-hydroxykynurenine reduced the viability of osteoblast-like cells. Picolinic acid exerted osteogenic effect in vitro. Kynurenine derivatives exert various effects on bones. Discovery of the exact mechanism of action of tryptophan metabolites on bones may take us a step closer to understanding the complicated mechanism of bone metabolism, which in turn may result in finding a new, effective therapy for treating bone diseases.",,Poland,2015,,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-26769827

Impaired prepulse inhibition (PPI) following an acoustic startle response is acknowledged as a cardinal characteristic in socially deprived weanling rats, which has been employed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of sensorimotor gating abnormalities in certain mental disorders, including schizophrenia. Because impaired PPI is a postnatal malfunction, it is interesting to examine whether it can be passed to the next generation. Isolation-rearing (IR) rats had been socially deprived since weaning, which mated with social rearing rats. Next, the offspring of IR rats were reared in a normal social environment. Locomotion, PPI, monoamines, and genes in schizophrenia-relevant brain areas [medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus] were later measured. To this end, we observed that the next generation of IR offspring rats appeared with impaired PPI in which the PPI deficit can be observed as early as three weeks after birth. The third generation also exhibited lower levels of dopamine and serotonin in the mPFC and hippocampus; however, higher levels of both monoamines were measured in the striatum. Finally, Slc1a2 was more highly expressed in the mPFC of the third generation male rats.

It has been proposed that a ~100-fold faster dissociation from the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) distinguishes atypical from typical antipsychotics. Furthermore, differing antipsychotic D2R affinities have been suggested to reflect differences in dissociation rate constants (koff), while association rate constants (kon) were assumed to be similar. However, it was recently demonstrated that lipophilic accumulation of ligand in the cell interior and/or membrane can cause underestimation of koff, and as high-affinity D2R antagonists are frequently lipophilic, this may have been a confounding factor in previous studies. In the present work, a functional electrophysiology assay was used to measure the recovery of dopamine-mediated D2R responsivity from antipsychotic antagonism, using elevated concentrations of dopamine to prevent the potential bias of re-binding of lipophilic ligands. The variability of antipsychotic kon was also reexamined, capitalizing on the temporal resolution of the assay. kon was estimated from the experimental recordings using a simple mathematical model assumed to describe the binding process. The time course of recovery from haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) was only 6.4- to 2.5-fold slower than that of the atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride, clozapine, and quetiapine, while antipsychotic kons were found to vary more widely than previously suggested. Finally, affinities calculated using our kon and koff estimates correlated well with functional potency and with affinities reported from radioligand binding studies.

METHODS: We observed climbing behavior, which is a dopamine (DA) receptor-associated behavior, to demonstrate changes in the dopaminergic system of the mesolimbic pathway, when mice were administrated either the nonselective DA agonist apomorphine only or were pre-treated with the selective D1 antagonist SCH23390, with the selective D2 antagonist sulpiride, or with the D2/D3 partial agonist aripiprazole (ARI). Moreover, we examined tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and D1- and D2-like receptor levels in the CPu, NAcC, and NAcSh using immunohistochemistry and autoradiography. RESULTS: The OBX group exhibited significantly enhanced apomorphine-induced climbing behavior, and this enhanced behavior was reversed by administration of sulpiride, ARI, and imipramine but not SCH23390. Moreover, we found a reduction in TH levels in the CPu, NAcC, and NAcSh of OBX mice and an increase in D2 receptor densities in the NAcC of OBX mice.

This review has two aims: first, to marshal and discuss evidences demonstrating an interaction between nootropic drugs and brain cholinergic mechanisms; second, to define the relationship between the effects on cholinergic mechanisms and the cognitive process. 2. Direct or indirect evidences indicating an activation of cholinergic mechanisms exist for pyrrolidinone derivatives including piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pyroglutamic acid, tenilsetam and pramiracetam and for miscellaneous chemical structures such as vinpocetine, naloxone, ebiratide and phosphatidylserine. All these drugs prevent or revert scopolamine-induced disruption of several learning and memory paradigms in animal and man. 3. Some of the pyrrolidinone derivatives also prevent amnesia associated with inhibition of acetylcholine synthesis brought about by hemicholinium. Oxiracetam prevents the decrease in brain acetylcholine and amnesia caused by electroconvulsive shock. Oxiracetam, aniracetam and pyroglutamic acid prevent brain acetylcholine decrease and amnesia induced by scopolamine. Comparable bell-shaped dose-effect relationships result for both actions. Phosphatidylserine restores acetylcholine synthesis and conditioned responses in aging rats. 4. The mechanisms through which the action on cholinergic systems might take place, including stimulation of the high affinity choline uptake, are discussed. The information available are not yet sufficient to define at which steps of the cognitive process the action on cholinergic system plays a role and which are the influences of the changes in cholinergic function on other neurochemical mechanisms of learning and memory.",,England,1989,10.1016/0278-5846(89)90112-7,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2694231

Several edited isoforms show reduced activity, suggesting that RNA editing modulates serotonergic systems in the brain with causative relevance to neuropsychiatric disorders. Transgenic mice solely expressing the non-edited 5-HT2 C R INI-isoform (INI) or the fully edited VGV-isoform exhibit various phenotypes including metabolic abnormalities, aggressive behaviour, anxiety-like behaviour, and depression-like behaviour. Here, we examined the behavioural phenotype and molecular changes of INI mice on a C57BL/6J background. INI mice showed an enhanced behavioural despair in the forced swimming test, elevated sensitivity to the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, and significantly decreased serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala, and striatum. They also showed reduced expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA in the NAc. In addition, by stereotactic injection of adeno-associated virus encoding NPY into the NAc, we demonstrated that accumbal NPY overexpression relieved behavioural despair.

We have shown previously that the reinforcing effects of cocaine can be correlated with drug binding to the mazindol and GBR 12935 binding sites on the dopamine transporter. In an attempt to identify the receptors associated with the reinforcing properties of amphetamine and related phenylethylamines, we have compared the potencies of these compounds in studies of drug reinforced behavior with their binding potencies at monoaminergic uptake sites and neurotransmitter receptor sites. The results of these experiments indicate that d-amphetamine exhibits a pharmacologically relevant micromolar affinity for dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin uptake sites as well as for alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites. Analysis of the data indicates that the reinforcing effects of phenylethylamines were not positively correlated with inhibition of ligand binding to any of the monoamine sites tested. However, the self-administration of amphetamine and related compounds may be inversely related to the inhibition of [3H]paroxetine binding to the serotonin transporter, suggesting that serotonin uptake inhibition opposes the reinforcing effects of amphetamine. This effect is not related to direct effects of drug binding at 5-HT2 receptor sites. Finally, amphetamine binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors suggests that these receptors could play a role in mediating the releasing or uptake inhibiting properties of the drug, and perhaps a role in some of its psychotomimetic effects.",,United States,1989,,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2703961

Similar dopamine depleting lesions of the nucleus accumbens, which attenuated the locomotor, but not the stereotypic, response to AMPH did not have this effect on CCS. This pattern of results supports the hypothesis that stereotypy has a coping function which may serve to alter arousal and further suggests important differences between the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine projections in modulating the responsiveness of the neuroendocrine system.

Serotonin is synthetized at the periphery into the gut by intestinal enterochromaffin cells and in the central nervous system (CNS) in the raphe nucleus from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Physiological effects of 5-HT are mediated by about 15Â serotoninergic receptors grouped into seven broad families (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, 5-HT7Â receptor families). Except 5-HT3Â receptor, a ligand-gated ion channels, all the others are G protein-coupled receptors. Serotonin's homeostasis involves serotoninergic autoreceptor such as 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, the enzymatic degradation of serotonin by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and a transporter (serotoninergic transporter [SERT]). In the CNS, the SERT is a key target for various antidepressant drugs such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI), Serotonin Norepinephrin Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI) and tricyclics family. However, antidepressant activity of SERT inhibitors is not directly mediated by the SERT inhibition, but a consequence of postsynaptic 5-HT receptor activation following the increase in 5-HT levels in the synaptic cleft. In pharmacology, SSRIs are defined as indirect agonist of postsynaptic receptor. Among all the 5-HT receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2B and 5-HT4Â receptors activation would mediate antidepressant effects. In the meanwhile, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6Â and 5-HT7Â receptors activation would induce opposite effects. The best serotoninergic antidepressant would directly activate 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2B and 5-HT4Â and would block 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6Â and 5-HT7Â receptor. If the chemical synthesis of such a compound may be compromised, SERT inhibition associated with the blockade of some but not all 5-HT receptor could shorten onset of action and/or improve antidepressant efficacy on the overall symptomatology of depression.",,France,2016,10.1016/j.encep.2016.03.012,Journal Article and Review,5-hydroxytryptamin and 5-hydroxytryptamine and Antidepressant and Antid<c3><a9>presseur and Receptor and R<c3><a9>cepteur and Serotonin and Serotoninergic transporter and S<c3><a9>rotonine and Transporteur s<c3><a9>rotoninergique and Tryptophan and Tryptophane,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27112704

Here, we report that the integrity of the brain histaminergic system is necessary for retrieval of inhibitory avoidance (IA) memory, because rats depleted of histamine through lateral ventricle injections of Î±-fluoromethylhistidine (a-FMHis), a suicide inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, displayed impaired IA memory when tested 2 d after training. a-FMHis was administered 24 h after training, when IA memory trace was already formed. Infusion of histamine in hippocampal CA1 of brain histamine-depleted rats (hence, amnesic) 10 min before the retention test restored IA memory but was ineffective when given in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Intra-CA1 injections of selective H1 and H2 receptor agonists showed that histamine exerted its effect by activating the H1 receptor. Noteworthy, the H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine disrupted IA memory retrieval in rats, thus strongly supporting an active involvement of endogenous histamine; 90 min after the retention test, c-Fos-positive neurons were significantly fewer in the CA1s of a-FMHis-treated rats that displayed amnesia compared with in the control group. We also found reduced levels of phosphorylated cAMP-responsive element binding protein (pCREB) in the CA1s of a-FMHis-treated animals compared with in controls. Increases in pCREB levels are associated with retrieval of associated memories. Targeting the histaminergic system may modify the retrieval of emotional memory; hence, histaminergic ligands might reduce dysfunctional aversive memories and improve the efficacy of exposure psychotherapies.",,United States,2016,10.1073/pnas.1604841113,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",H1 receptor and histamine and inhibitory avoidance and memory and retrieval,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27118833

Its physiological effects are mediated by five closely related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are divided into two major subclasses: the D1-like (D1, D5) and the D2-like (D2, D3, D4) receptors. D3 receptors (D3Rs) have the highest density in the limbic areas of the brain, which are associated with cognitive and emotional functions. These receptors are therefore attractive targets for therapeutic management. AREAS COVERED: This review summarizes the functional and pharmacological characteristics of D3Rs, including the design and clinical relevance of full agonists, partial agonists and antagonists, as well as the capacity of these receptors to form active homodimers, heterodimers or higher order receptor complexes as pharmacological targets in several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. EXPERT OPINION: The high sequence homology between D3R and the D2-type challenges the development of D3R-selective compounds. The design of new D3R-preferential ligands with improved physicochemical properties should provide a better pharmacokinetic/bioavailability profile and lesser toxicity than is found with existing D3R ligands. It is also essential to optimize D3R affinity and, especially, D3R vs. D2-type binding and functional selectivity ratios. Developing allosteric and bitopic ligands should help to improve the D3R selectivity of these drugs. As most evidence points to the ability of GPCRs to form homomers and heteromers, the most promising therapeutic strategy in the future is likely to involve the application of heteromer-selective drugs. These selective ligands would display different affinities for a given receptor depending on the receptor partners within the heteromer. Therefore, designing novel compounds that specifically target and modulate D1R-D3R heteromers would be an interesting approach for the treatment of levodopa (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesias.",,England,2016,10.1080/17460441.2016.1185413,Journal Article and Review,Allosteric modulation and GPCR and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and Parkinson<e2><80><99>s disease and drug addiction and heteromer-selective drug and heteromerization and homomerization and restless legs syndrome and schizophrenia,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27135354

An imbalance of central oxytocinergic neurotransmission has been also associated with different mental pathologies, from depression, anxiety and anorexia/bulimia to schizophrenia, autism and drug dependence. This study shows that oxytocin may also play a role in the control of locomotor activity. Accordingly, intraperitoneal oxytocin (0.5-2000Î¼g/kg) reduced locomotor activity of adult male rats. This effect was abolished by d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)-vasotocin, an oxytocin receptor antagonist, given into the lateral ventricles at the dose of 2Î¼g/rat, which was ineffective on locomotor activity. Oxytocin (50-200ng/site) also reduced and d(CH2)5Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)-vasotocin (2Î¼g/site) increased locomotor activity when injected bilaterally into the substantia nigra, a key area in the control of locomotor activity. Conversely, the destruction of nigral neurons bearing oxytocin receptors by the recently characterized neurotoxin oxytocin-saporin injected into the substantia nigra, increased basal locomotor activity. Since oxytocin-saporin injected into the substantia nigra caused a marked reduction of neurons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (e.g., nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons) and for vesicular glutamate transporters VGluT1, VGluT2 and VGluT3 (e.g., glutamatergic neurons), but not for glutamic acid decarboxylase (e.g., GABAergic neurons), together these findings suggest that oxytocin influences locomotor activity by acting on receptors localized presynaptically in nigral glutamatergic nerve terminals (which control the activity of nigral GABAergic efferent neurons projecting to brain stem nuclei controlling locomotor activity), rather than on receptors localized in the cell bodies/dendrites of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.",,United States,2016,10.1016/j.yhbeh.2016.05.012,Journal Article,Dopamine and Glutamic acid and Locomotor activity and Oxytocin and Oxytocin-saporin and Substantia nigra,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27189764

These unique therapeutic properties have prompted researchers to explore the mechanisms mediating the antidepressant effects of ketamine, but despite many efforts, no consensus on its antidepressant mechanism of action has been reached. Recent preclinical reports have associated the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) with the antidepressant-like action of ketamine. Here, we review the current evidence for a serotonergic role in ketamine's antidepressant effects. The pharmacological profile of ketamine may include equipotent activity on several non-NMDA targets, and the current hypotheses for the mechanisms responsible for ketamine's antidepressant activity do not appear to preclude the possibility that non-glutamate neurotransmitters are involved in the antidepressant effects. At multiple levels, the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems interact, and such crosstalk could support the notion that changes in serotonergic neurotransmission may impact ketamine's antidepressant potential. In line with these prospects, ketamine may increase 5-HT levels in the prefrontal cortex of rats, plausibly via hippocampal NMDA receptor inhibition and activation of Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. In addition, a number of preclinical studies suggest that the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine may depend on endogenous activation of 5-HT receptors. Recent imaging and behavioral data predominantly support a role for 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptors, but the full range of 5-HT receptors has currently not been systematically investigated in this context. Furthermore, the nature of any 5-HT dependent mechanism in ketamine's antidepressant effect is currently not understood, and therefore, more studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis and explore the specific pathways that might implicate 5-HT.",,England,2016,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2016.05.007,Journal Article and Review,Antidepressant and Glutamate and Ketamine and Pharmacology and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27262695

The stem barks are used in the treatment of hypertension, insomnia, tumour, depression, rheumatism and as a tonic. This study was carried out to investigate antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effect of the hydroethanol stem bark extract of M. indica (HeMI) in mice. METHODS: HeMI (12.5-100â€†mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 1â€‰h before subjecting the animal to the forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and elevated plus maze tests (EPM). RESULTS: HeMI (12.5-100â€†mg/kg, p.o.) treatment produced significant reduction in immobility time [F(6.56)=8.35, p<0.001], [F(6,56)=7.55, p<0.001] in the FST and TST, respectively. Moreover, co-administration of sub-therapeutic doses of imipramine or fluoxetine with HeMI (3.125â€†mg/kg) elicited significant reduction in time spent immobile in the FST. However, pretreatment of mice with parachlorophenylalanine, metergoline, yohimbine or sulpiride abolished the antidepressant-like effect elicited by HeMI. In the EPM, HeMI produced significant [F(5,42)=8.91, p<0.001] increase in open arms exploration by 75.55â€†% and this effect was blocked by pretreatment of mice with flumazenil or metergoline. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study showed antidepressant-like effect of M. indica through interaction with 5-HT2 receptor, Î±2-adrenoceptor and dopamine D2-receptors. Also, an anxiolytic-like effect through its affinity for 5-HT2 and benzodiazepine receptors.

Mammalian research has established that VEN exposure is associated with a range of structural, neurochemical, and functional alterations of the brain in adults and newborns. However, the neurodevelopmental effects of VEN on non-target organisms have never been investigated. The aim of our research was to decrease this gap in knowledge by characterizing the effects of VEN exposure on a cephalopod mollusk, the common cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. This species inhabits VEN-contaminated waters and possesses an unusually sophisticated brain. These characteristics render it a unique invertebrate species for studying the neurodevelopmental effects of VEN. Cuttlefish were exposed to environmentally-relevant concentrations of VEN (Measured concentrations â‰ˆ5 and 100ngL(-)(1)) or to filtered natural seawater (control) in a closed-loop system with regular water changes during the first 20days after hatching. We evaluated brain maturation as well as neurochemical changes and behavioral performances during this critical period of development. Our results show that both VEN-exposed groups exhibited a decrease in norepinephrine levels, along with a reduction in the relative number of glutamate NMDA-like receptors binding sites in the group exposed to 5ngL(-1) of VEN after 20days of exposure. Brain regional changes in cellular proliferation were observed in VEN-exposed groups in the vertical lobe (i.e. a key structure involved in cognitive processes) and in the optic lobes (i.e. main visual processing centers) in the absence of significant change in their volume. Along with these neurodevelopmental changes, 20days of exposure to 100ngL(-1) of VEN was associated with a decrease in camouflage ability.

Basal adenylate cyclase activity was reduced by up to 56% in the injected side and the sensitivity to dopamine was abolished. Up to 84% of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity, hydrolyzing either cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP, was destroyed by kainic acid injection. Specific binding of [3H]etorphine and [3H]spiroperidol was reduced by up to 62% in the injected side, while non-specific binding was unchanged. All of these changes were time-dependent, and were greatest 7--14 days after kainic acid treatment. On the other hand, intrastriatal kainic acid injection caused no change in the steady-state concentration of cyclic AMP in striatal slices, or in the in vivo cyclic AMP content in the striatum of rats killed by microwave irradiation. Receptor-mediated increases in cyclic AMP accumulation in striatal slices were either unchanged or markedly potentiated by kainic acid treatment. The maximum response to adenosine was unchanged, while the response to isoprenaline was increased up to 3.7-fold, the response to dopamine increased up to 6.7-fold, and the response to PGE1 increased up to 30-fold. The effect of dopamine in kainic acid-treated striatal slices was no longer blocked by fluphenazine, but was blocked by propranolol, suggesting an interaction of dopamine with a beta-adrenoceptor in kainic acid-treated slices. The results suggest differential cellular localizations of the various receptor-linked cyclic AMP systems in rat neostriatum. Some dopamine and opiate receptors, as well as most of the phosphodiesterase activity, are associated with local neuronal elements, while beta-adrenoceptor, adenosine and PGE1 alterations in cyclic AMP are not. The potentiation of the beta-adrenoceptor and PGE1 responses suggests that they may occur in glial cells. In addition, the pool of adenylate cyclase destroyed by kainic acid appears to make little contribution to normal levels of cyclic AMP in the tissue.",,Netherlands,1978,10.1016/0006-8993(78)91083-1,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27287

Agmatine is an endogenous arginine metabolite that emerges as neuromodulator and a promising agent to manage diverse central nervous system disorders by modulating nitric oxide (NO) pathway, glutamate NMDA receptors and oxidative stress. Herein, we investigated the effects of a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of different agmatine doses (10, 30 or 100mg/kg) against the orofacial dyskinesia induced by reserpine (1mg/kg,s.c.) in mice by measuring the vacuous chewing movements and tongue protusion frequencies, and the duration of facial twitching. The results showed an orofacial antidyskinetic effect of agmatine (30mg/kg, i.p.) or the combined administration of sub-effective doses of agmatine (10mg/kg, i.p.) with the NMDA receptor antagonists amantadine (1mg/kg, i.p.) and MK801 (0.01mg/kg, i.p.) or the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI; 0.1mg/kg, i.p.). Reserpine-treated mice displayed locomotor activity deficits in the open field and agmatine had no effect on this response. Reserpine increased nitrite and nitrate levels in cerebral cortex, but agmatine did not reverse it. Remarkably, agmatine reversed the decrease of dopamine and non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels caused by reserpine in the striatum. However, no changes were observed in striatal immunocontent of proteins related to the dopaminergic system including tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter, vesicular monoamine transporter type 2, pDARPP-32[Thr75], dopamine D1 and D2 receptors.

This was correlated with an attenuation in the ability of (+)-amphetamine to stimulate [3H]dopamine formation from [3H]tyrosine in rat striatal slices of these nicotine-treated animals. In long-term (14-day) nicotine-pretreated animals, both the apomorphine- and (+)-amphetamine-induced locomotor activity were potentiated.

Genetic mutations in Arc pathway and altered Arc expression in human frontal cortex have been associated with schizophrenia. Although Arc expression has been reported to vary with age, what mechanisms regulate Arc mRNA levels in frontal cortex during postnatal development remains unclear. Using quantitative mRNA analysis of mouse frontal cortical tissues, we mapped the developmental profiles of Arc expression and found that its mRNA levels are sharply amplified near the end of the second postnatal week, when mouse pups open their eyes for the first time after birth. Surprisingly, electrical stimulation of the frontal cortex before eye-opening is not sufficient to drive the amplification of Arc mRNA. Instead, this amplification needs both electrical stimulation and dopamine D1-type receptor (D1R) activation. Furthermore, visual stimuli-driven amplification of Arc mRNA is also dependent on D1R activation and dopamine neurons located in the ventral midbrain. These results indicate that dopamine is required to drive activity-dependent amplification of Arc mRNA in the developing postnatal frontal cortex and suggest that joint electrical and dopaminergic activation is essential to establish the normal expression pattern of a schizophrenia-associated gene during frontal cortical development.",,United States,2017,10.1093/cercor/bhw181,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",activity-dependent gene expression and arc and dopamine and frontal cortex and postnatal development,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27365296

In schizophrenia, hypofrontality has been further suggested to cause both the negative and cognitive symptoms, and overactivity of dopamine neurons that project to subcortical areas. The latter may contribute to the development of positive symptoms of the disorder. Nevertheless, what causes hypofrontality and how it alters dopamine transmission in subcortical structures remain unclear due, in part, to the difficulty in modeling hypofrontality using previous techniques (e.g. PFC lesioning, focal cooling, repeated treatment with psychotomimetic drugs). We propose that the use of designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) chemogenetic technique will allow precise interrogations of PFC functions. Combined with electrophysiological recordings, we can investigate the effects of PFC hypofunction on activity of dopamine neurons. Importantly, from a drug target discovery perspective, the use of DREADDs will enable us to examine whether chemogenetically enhancing PFC activity will reverse the behavioral abnormalities associated with PFC hypofunction and dopamine neuron overactivity, and also explore druggable targets for the treatment of schizophrenia and other disorders associated with abnormalities via modulation of the G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway.

Part A, Clinical and molecular teratology",,"BACKGROUND: Human studies are inconsistent with respect to an association between treatment with selective serotonin and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI/SNRIs) and an increase in the incidence of congenital heart defects. Here we tested the hypothesis that in utero exposure to venlafaxine, a highly prescribed SNRI, increases the incidence of fetal heart defects and alters placental and fetal heart serotonin signaling in the rat. METHODS: Timed-pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were gavaged daily with venlafaxine hydrochloride (0, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day) from gestation day 8 to 20. On gestation day 21, fetuses were examined for external and internal malformations; placentas and fetal hearts were collected for the analysis of gene expression. RESULTS: Venlafaxine had no effect on the number of live fetuses, fetal body weights, or external morphology in the absence of maternal toxicity. However, venlafaxine significantly increased the placental index (fetal body/placental weight ratio) and the incidence of fetal cardiac anomalies. Venlafaxine exposure decreased placental expression of the serotonin transporter (SERT/Slc6a4) at the transcript and protein levels. In contrast, venlafaxine increased SERT expression in the hearts of female, but not male, fetuses. Expression of the serotonin 2B receptor (5-HT(2B) /Htr2b) and of fibroblast growth factor 8 was induced in fetal hearts. CONCLUSION: In utero venlafaxine exposure altered the placental index and induced fetal cardiac anomalies in rats. We propose that the increased incidence of cardiac anomalies is mediated through alterations in serotonin signaling in the placenta and fetal heart. Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2016.

We recently demonstrated that P2X4R knockout (KO) mice exhibited deficits in sensorimotor gating, social interaction, and ethanol drinking behavior. Dopamine (DA) dysfunction may underlie these behavioral changes, but there is no direct evidence for P2X4Rs' role in DA neurotransmission. To test this hypothesis, we measured markers of DA function and dependent behaviors in P2X4R KO mice. P2X4R KO mice exhibited altered density of pre-synaptic markers including tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine transporter; post-synaptic markers including dopamine receptors and phosphorylation of downstream targets including dopamine and cyclic-AMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32Â kDa and cyclic-AMP-response element binding protein in different parts of the striatum. Ivermectin, an allosteric modulator of P2X4Rs, significantly affected dopamine and cyclic AMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32Â kDa and extracellular regulated kinase1/2 phosphorylation in the striatum. Sensorimotor gating deficits in P2X4R KO mice were rescued by DA antagonists. Using the 6-hydroxydopamine model of DA depletion, P2X4R KO mice exhibited an attenuated levodopa (L-DOPA)-induced motor behavior, whereas ivermectin enhanced this behavior. Collectively, these findings identified an important role for P2X4Rs in maintaining DA homeostasis and illustrate how this association is important for CNS functions including motor control and sensorimotor gating. We propose that P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) regulate dopamine (DA) homeostasis and associated behaviors.

These reproductive dysfunctions are likely mediated by elevations of the hormone prolactin. Yet, how serotonin (5-HT) and SSRIs cause changes in prolactin secretion is not known. Here, using in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show that 5-HT hyperpolarizes and abolishes phasic discharge in rat neuroendocrine tuberoinfundibular dopamine (TIDA) neurons, the main inhibitor of prolactin secretion. This process is underpinned by 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K(+)-like currents. We further demonstrate that the SSRIs, fluoxetine and sertraline, directly suppress TIDA neuron activity through parallel effects, independent of 5-HT transmission. This inhibition involves decreased intrinsic excitability and a slowing of TIDA network rhythms. These findings indicate that SSRIs may inhibit neuroendocrine dopamine release through both 5-HT-dependent and -independent actions, providing a mechanistic explanation for, and potential molecular targets for the amelioration of, the hyperprolactinemia and sexual dysfunction associated with these drugs. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Depression affects approximately one-tenth of the population and is commonly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; e.g., Prozac). Yet, many patients withdraw from SSRI therapy due to sexual side effects (e.g., infertility, menstrual disturbances, and impotence). Although it is generally accepted that sexual side effects are due to the ability of these drugs to elevate blood levels of the hormone prolactin, the mechanism for this hormonal imbalance is not known. Here, we show that SSRIs can inhibit hypothalamic dopamine neurons that normally suppress the secretion of prolactin. Intriguingly this inhibition can be explained both by increased serotonin activity and also by parallel serotonin-independent actions.",,United States,2016,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4061-15.2016,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",depression and dopamine and fluoxetine and neuroendocrine and prolactin and tuberoinfundibular,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27413150

Indeed, hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) electrical stimuli reduce the nociceptive neuronal activity (i.e., neuronal discharge associated with activation of AÎ´- and C-fibers) of the spinal dorsal horn wide dynamic range (WDR) cells and nociceptive behavior. Furthermore, raphe magnus nuclei lesion reduces the PVN-induced antinociception, suggesting a functional interaction between the OXT and the serotoninergic system. The present study investigated in Wistar rats the potential role of spinal serotonergic mechanisms in the OXT- and PVN-induced antinociception. In long-term secondary mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by formalin or extracellular unitary recordings of the WDR cells we evaluated the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) effect on the OXT-induced antinociception. All drugs were given intrathecally (i.t.). OXT (1Ã—10(-5)-1Ã—10(-4)nmol) or 5-HT (1Ã—10(-3)-1Ã—10(-1)nmol) prevented the formalin-induced sensitization, an effect mimicked by PVN stimulation. Moreover, administration of OXT (1Ã—10(-5)nmol) plus 5-HT (1Ã—10(-3)nmol) at ineffective doses, produced antinociception. This effect was antagonized by: (i) d(CH(2))(5)[Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Tyr-NH(2)(9)]OVT (oxytocin receptor antagonist; 2Ã—10(-2)nmol); or (ii) methiothepin (a non-specific 5-HT(1/2/5/6/7) receptor antagonist; 80nmol). Similar results were obtained with PVN stimulation plus 5-HT (5Ã—10(-5)nmol). In WDR cell recordings, the PVN-induced antinociception was enhanced by i.t. 5-HT and partly blocked when the spinal cord was pre-treated with methiothepin (80nmol).

Using insights from computational reinforcement-learning models and basic-science studies of the dopamine system, we show that each of these two disturbances contributes to a specific symptom domain and explains a large set of experimental findings associated with that domain. Reduced phasic responses for relevant stimuli help to explain negative symptoms and provide a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with negative symptoms: reduced learning from rewards; blunted activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for rewards and positive prediction errors; blunted activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation; blunted autonomic responding for relevant stimuli; blunted neural activation for aversive outcomes and aversive prediction errors; reduced willingness to expend effort for rewards; and psychomotor slowing. Increased spontaneous phasic dopamine release helps to explain positive symptoms and provides a unified explanation for the following experimental findings in schizophrenia, most of which have been shown to correlate with positive symptoms: aberrant learning for neutral cues (assessed with behavioral and autonomic responses), and aberrant, increased activation of the ventral striatum, midbrain, and other limbic regions for neutral cues, neutral outcomes, and neutral prediction errors. Taken together, then, these two disturbances explain many findings in schizophrenia.

Key depressive symptoms can be modeled in animals and enable the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Chronic unavoidable stress disrupts rats' competence to escape noxious stimuli and self-administer sucrose, configuring a depression model characterized by escape deficit and motivational anhedonia associated to impaired dopaminergic responses to sucrose in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS). Repeated treatments that restore these responses also relieve behavioral symptoms. Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons encode reward and motivation and are implicated in the neuropathology of depressive-like behaviors. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors type-Î± (PPARÎ±) acutely regulate VTA dopamine neuron firing via Î²2 subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Î²2*nAChRs) through phosphorylation and this effect is predictive of antidepressant-like effects. Here, by combining behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical techniques, we studied the effects of repeated PPARÎ± stimulation by fenofibrate on mesolimbic dopamine system. We found decreased Î²2*nAChRs phosphorylation levels and a switch from tonic to phasic activity of dopamine cells in the VTA, and increased phosphorylation of dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) in the NAcS. We then investigated whether long-term fenofibrate administration to stressed rats reinstated the decreased DARPP-32 response to sucrose and whether this effect translated into antidepressant-like properties. Fenofibrate restored dopaminergic responses to appetitive stimuli, reactivity to aversive stimuli and motivation to self-administer sucrose. Overall, this study suggests PPARÎ± as new targets for antidepressant therapies endowed with motivational anti-anhedonic properties, further supporting the role of an unbalanced mesolimbic dopamine system in pathophysiology of depressive disorders.",,England,2016,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.07.024,Journal Article,Chronic stress and Depression and Dopamine neurons and Fenofibrate (PubChem CID: 3339) and Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha and Self-administration,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27457507

Previous studies suggest that ketamine's antidepressant properties involve enhancement of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized to (2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), which have antidepressant actions independent of N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor inhibition. These antidepressant actions of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, or other metabolites, as well as ketamine's side effects, including abuse potential, may be related to direct effects on components of the dopaminergic (DAergic) system. Here, brain and blood distribution/clearance and pharmacodynamic analyses at DA receptors (D1-D5) and the DA, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters were assessed for ketamine and its major metabolites (norketamine, dehydronorketamine, and HNKs). Additionally, we measured electrically evoked mesolimbic DA release and decay using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry following acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (2, 10, and 50 mg/kg, i.p.). Following ketamine injection, ketamine, norketamine, and multiple hydroxynorketamines were detected in the plasma and brain of mice. Dehydronorketamine was detectable in plasma, but concentrations were below detectable limits in the brain. Ketamine did not alter the magnitude or kinetics of evoked DA release in the nucleus accumbens in anesthetized mice. Neither ketamine's enantiomers nor its metabolites had affinity for DA receptors or the DA, noradrenaline, and serotonin transporters (up to 10 Î¼M). These results suggest that neither the side effects nor antidepressant actions of ketamine or ketamine metabolites are associated with direct effects on mesolimbic DAergic neurotransmission.

417ee255-ad7b-4c00-9b14-f79edc209626,Development of a photoaffinity ligand for octopamine receptors.,Nathanson JA ,Molecular pharmacology,,"Octapamine receptors are widely distributed in invertebrate species, yet little is known about their biochemical structure or tissue localization, in part because there exist no high affinity or irreversible ligands for these receptors. This paper characterizes 2-(2,6-diethyl-4-azidophenylimino)imidazolidine (NC-5Z), a new, high affinity octopamine receptor probe that binds reversibly and, under photolyzing conditions, irreversibly to membrane-associated octopamine receptors. Under reversible conditions NC-5Z is a full agonist, 50-100 times more potent than octopamine in activating the highly enriched and specific octopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase of the firefly light organ. NC-5Z shows a similar potency in cockroach muscle and thoracic ganglia and in tobacco hornworm nerve cord. Activation of light organ adenylate cyclase by NC-5Z is nonadditive to that caused by octopamine and can be blocked by antagonists, including mainserin (Ki = 0.9 microM), cyproheptadine (Ki = 5 microM), phentolamine (Ki = 20 microM), and propranolol (Ki = 75 microM). These constants agree well with those for the same antagonists in inhibiting stimulation due to octopamine. In physiological studies, NC-5Z mimics the action of, but is more potent than, octopamine in stimulating light emission in intact firefly tails and in disrupting motor behavior and feeding of tobacco hornworms. Under reversible conditions, [3H]NC-5Z, the tritiated derivative of NC-5Z, binds to light organ membranes with an apparent affinity (0.59-0.7 microM) similar to that (0.35-0.7 microM) for NC-5Z in activating adenylate cyclase. Under photolyzing conditions, NC-5Z irreversibly activates light organ adenylate cyclase, and this can be blocked by an excess of octopamine. Under similar conditions, [3H]NC-5Z binds irreversibly to light organ membranes and to membranes from tobacco hornworm nerve ganglia, fat body, and gut. This binding is reduced by prior incubation with octopamine agonists, including octopamine, demethyl-chlordimeform, and 2-(phenylimino)imidazolidines, but not by norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, or histamine. Irreversible binding is also reduced by prior incubation with antagonists, most effectively (55% of total binding) by mianserin. The apparent affinity of [3H]NC-5Z for membrane binding, as reflected by its ability to be displaced by mianserin, is altered by GTP. In autoradiographic studies of whole tissue, [3H]NC-5Z shows irreversible, mianserin-displaceable labeling of intact firefly light organs. Taken together, these data indicate that NC-5Z and [3H]NC-5Z are potent and selective agonists of octopamine receptors in a variety of tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,United States,1989,,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2747629

Nicotine is the principal psychoactive ingredient in tobacco that causes addiction. The structures governing nicotine addiction, including those underlying withdrawal, are still being explored. Nicotine withdrawal is characterized by negative affective and cognitive symptoms that enhance relapse susceptibility, and suppressed dopaminergic transmission from ventral tegmental area (VTA) to target structures underlies behavioral symptoms of nicotine withdrawal. Agonist and partial agonist therapies help 1 in 4 treatment-seeking smokers at one-year post-cessation, and new targets are needed to more effectively aid smokers attempting to quit. Hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons send excitatory projections to dopamine (DA)-producing neurons of VTA and modulate mesoaccumbal DA release. The effects of nicotinic receptor blockade, which is commonly used to precipitate withdrawal, on orexin neurons remain poorly investigated and present an attractive target for intervention. The present study sought to investigate the effects of nicotinic receptor blockade on hypothalamic orexin neurons using mecamylamine to precipitate withdrawal in rats. Separate groups of rats were treated with either chronic nicotine or saline for 7-days at which point effects of mecamylamine or saline on somatic signs and anxiety-like behavior were assessed. Finally, tissue from rats was harvested for immunofluorescent analysis of Fos within orexin neurons. Results demonstrate that nicotinic receptor blockade leads to reduced orexin cell activity, as indicated by lowered Fos-immunoreactivity, and suggest that this underlying cellular activity may be associated with symptoms of nicotine withdrawal as effects were most prominently observed in rats given chronic nicotine. We conclude from this study that orexin transmission becomes suppressed in rats upon nicotinic receptor blockade, and that behavioral symptoms associated with nicotine withdrawal may be aided by intervention upon orexinergic transmission.",,Netherlands,2016,10.1016/j.bbr.2016.07.053,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Addiction and Fos and Hypocretin and Hypothalamus and Mecamylamine and Nicotine withdrawal and Orexin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27491589

Here we selectively activated TH(VTA) neurons in transgenic rats and measured resulting changes in whole-brain activity using stimulus-evoked functional magnetic resonance imaging. Applying a standard generalized linear model analysis approach, our results indicate that selective optogenetic stimulation of TH(VTA) neurons enhanced cerebral blood volume signals in striatal target regions in a dopamine receptor-dependent manner. However, brain-wide voxel-based principal component analysis of the same data set revealed that dopaminergic modulation activates several additional anatomically distinct regions throughout the brain, not typically associated with dopamine release events. Furthermore, explicit pairing of TH(VTA) neuronal activation with a forepaw stimulus of a particular frequency expanded the sensory representation of that stimulus, not exclusively within the somatosensory cortices, but brain-wide.

UCS applied for 28 days induced a depressive-like behavior, characterized by decrease in the time of grooming in the splash test and by increase in the immobility time in the tail suspension test. Oral treatment with chrysin (5 or 20mg/kg, 28 days), similarly to fluoxetine (10mg/kg, positive control), culminated in the prevention of these alterations.

In prepulse inhibition (an operational measure of sensorimotor gating), BQCA alone had minimal effects but exhibited different levels of efficacy in reversing MK-801-induced prepulse inhibition disruptions when combined with a subeffective dose of each of the three (currently prescribed) antipsychotics. Furthermore, the combined effect of BQCA and clozapine was absent in M(1)(-/-) mice. Interestingly, although BQCA alone had no effect in reversing MK-801-induced memory impairments in a Y-maze spatial test, we observed a reversal upon the combination of BQCA with atypical antipsychotics, but not with haloperidol. These findings provide proof of concept that a judicious combination of existing antipsychotics with a selective M(1) mAChR positive allosteric modulator can extend antipsychotic efficacy in glutamatergic deficit models of behavior.",,United States,2016,10.1124/jpet.116.235788,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27630144

Because it was initially based on indirect evidence and findings in patients with established schizophrenia, it was unclear what role dopamine played in the onset of the disorder. However, recent studies in people at risk of schizophrenia have found elevated striatal dopamine synthesis capacity and increased dopamine release to stress. Furthermore, striatal dopamine changes have been linked to altered cortical function during cognitive tasks, in line with preclinical evidence that a circuit involving cortical projections to the striatum and midbrain may underlie the striatal dopamine changes. Other studies have shown that a number of environmental risk factors for schizophrenia, such as social isolation and childhood trauma, also affect presynaptic dopaminergic function. Advances in preclinical work and genetics have begun to unravel the molecular architecture linking dopamine, psychosis, and psychosocial stress. Included among the many genes associated with risk of schizophrenia are the gene encoding the dopamine D(2) receptor and those involved in the upstream regulation of dopaminergic synthesis, through glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic pathways. A number of these pathways are also linked to the stress response. We review these new lines of evidence and present a model of how genes and environmental factors may sensitize the dopamine system so that it is vulnerable to acute stress, leading to progressive dysregulation and the onset of psychosis. Finally, we consider the implications for rational drug development, in particular regionally selective dopaminergic modulation, and the potential of genetic factors to stratify patients.",,United States,2017,10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.07.014,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",Dopamine and Etiology and Genetics and Neuroimaging and PET and Prodrome and Psychosis and Schizophrenia and Stress,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27720198

While KOR agonists produce pro-depressant-like effects, KOR antagonists produce anti-depressant-like effects in rodent models. The cellular mechanisms and downstream effector(s) by which KOR ligands produce these effects are not clear. KOR agonists modulate serotonin (5-HT) transmission in the brain regions implicated in mood and motivation regulation. Presynaptic serotonin transporter (SERT) activity is critical in the modulation of synaptic 5-HT and, subsequently, in mood disorders. Detailing the molecular events of KOR-linked SERT regulation is important for examining the postulated role of this protein in mood disorders. In this study, we used heterologous expression systems and native tissue preparations to determine the cellular signaling cascades linked to KOR-mediated SERT regulation. KOR agonists U69,593 and U50,488 produced a time and concentration dependent KOR antagonist-reversible decrease in SERT function. KOR-mediated functional down-regulation of SERT is sensitive to CaMKII and Akt inhibition. The U69,593-evoked decrease in SERT activity is associated with a decreased transport V(max), reduced SERT cell surface expression, and increased SERT phosphorylation. Furthermore, KOR activation enhanced SERT internalization and decreased SERT delivery to the membrane. These data demonstrate that KOR activation decreases 5-HT uptake by altering SERT trafficking mechanisms and phosphorylation status to reduce the functional availability of surface SERT.",,England,2017,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2016.10.011,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Clearance and Kappa opioid receptor and Phosphorylation and Serotonin and Serotonin transporter and Trafficking,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27743931

In the past century, experimental evidence has accumulated on the proteins knowledge that is involved in the synthesis, reuptake, and transportation of DA in leukocytes and the differential expression of the D1-like (D1R and D5R) and D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, and D4R). The expression of these components depends on the state of cellular activation and the concentration and time of exposure to DA. Receptors that are expressed in leukocytes are linked to signaling pathways that are mediated by changes in cAMP concentration, which in turn triggers changes in phenotype and cellular function. According to the leukocyte lineage, the effects of DA are associated with such processes as respiratory burst, cytokine and antibody secretion, chemotaxis, apoptosis, and cytotoxicity. In clinical conditions such as schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, Tourette syndrome, and multiple sclerosis (MS), there are evident alterations during immune responses in leukocytes, in which changes in DA receptor density have been observed.

Although these disorders are frequently linked to social stress and to deficits in social engagement, little is known about sex differences in the neural mechanisms that underlie these phenomena. Phenotypes characterized by dominance, competitive aggression, and active coping strategies appear to be more resilient to psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared with those characterized by subordinate status and the lack of aggressiveness. Here, we report that serotonin (5-HT) and arginine-vasopressin (AVP) act in opposite ways in the hypothalamus to regulate dominance and aggression in females and males. Hypothalamic injection of a 5-HT1a agonist stimulated aggression in female hamsters and inhibited aggression in males, whereas injection of AVP inhibited aggression in females and stimulated aggression in males. Striking sex differences were also identified in the neural mechanisms regulating dominance. Acquisition of dominance was associated with activation of 5-HT neurons within the dorsal raphe in females and activation of hypothalamic AVP neurons in males. These data strongly indicate that there are fundamental sex differences in the neural regulation of dominance and aggression. Further, because systemically administered fluoxetine increased aggression in females and substantially reduced aggression in males, there may be substantial gender differences in the clinical efficacy of commonly prescribed 5-HT-active drugs such as selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors. These data suggest that the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as PTSD may be more effective with the use of 5-HT-targeted drugs in females and AVP-targeted drugs in males.",,United States,2016,10.1073/pnas.1610446113,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",agonistic and fluoxetine and gender differences and hamster and social behavior,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27807133

In contrast to classic neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors, drugs that deplete presynaptic dopamine by blocking vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) seem to be safer and have little or no risk of tardive dyskinesia. This is one reason why there has been a recent emergence of novel VMAT2 inhibitors.

This review, based largely on a detailed search of PubMed, will summarize the pharmacology and clinical experience with the various VMAT2 inhibitors.

In rats, chronic food restriction during a period of withdrawal following heroin self-administration augments heroin seeking. The mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and core dopamine (DA) in food restriction-induced augmentation of heroin seeking. Rats were trained to self-administer heroin (0.1â€‰mg/kg/infusion) for 10 days. Next, rats were moved to the animal colony for a withdrawal period, during which rats were food restricted to 90% of their original body weight (FDR group) or given unrestricted access to food (sated group). On day 14 of food restriction, rats were returned to the operant conditioning chambers for a heroin-seeking test under extinction conditions. Extracellular DA levels were assessed using in vivo microdialysis. In separate experiments, the DA D1-like receptor antagonist SCH39166 (12.5, 25.0, or 50.0â€‰ng/side) was administered into the NAc before the heroin-seeking test. In the NAc shell, pre-test exposure to the heroin-associated context increased DA only in FDR rats; but in the NAc core, DA increased regardless of feeding condition. Food restriction significantly augmented heroin seeking and increased DA in the NAc shell and core during the test. Intra-NAc shell administration of SCH39166 decreased heroin seeking in all rats. In contrast, in the NAc core, SCH39166 selectively decreased the augmentation of heroin-seeking induced by chronic food restriction. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of the DA D1-like receptor in the NAc core is important for food restriction-induced augmentation of heroin seeking.",,England,2017,10.1038/npp.2016.250,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-27824052

An ethogram encompassing 9 behavioural components was employed. Durations and frequencies were only slightly affected by treatments. However, as revealed by multivariate t-pattern analysis, histamine depletion was associated with a striking increase in the number of behavioural patterns. We found 42 patterns of different composition occurring, on average, 520.90Â Â±Â 50.23 times per mouse in the histamine depleted (HD) group, whereas controls showed 12 different patterns occurring on average 223.30Â Â±Â 20.64 times.

To test the hypothesis of a histamine-dopamine interplay on behavioural pattern phenotype, non-sedative doses of the D2/D3 antagonist sulpiride (12.5-25-50Â mg/kg) were additionally administered to different groups of HD mice. Sulpiride counterbalanced the enhancement of exploratory patterns of different composition, but it did not affect the mean number of patterns at none of the doses used.

Accordingly, to examine the effects of reduced Brd1 expression, we generated a genetically modified Brd1(+/-) mouse and subjected it to behavioral, electrophysiological, molecular, and integrative genomic analyses with focus on schizophrenia-relevant parameters. RESULTS: Brd1(+/-) mice displayed cerebral histone H3K14 hypoacetylation and a broad range of behavioral changes with translational relevance to schizophrenia. These behaviors were accompanied by striatal dopamine/serotonin abnormalities and cortical excitation-inhibition imbalances involving loss of parvalbumin immunoreactive interneurons.

After intrahypothalamic injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan, an immediate precursor of serotonin in cats pretreated with parachlorophenylalanine, serotonin-immunoreactivity was detected in many fibers surrounding the injection site. Furthermore, when 5-hydroxytryptophan was injected with inhibitor of monoamine oxidase, a large number of small neurons immunoreactive to serotonin was identified in many discrete regions: the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, preoptic area, suprachiasmatic nucleus, dorsal hypothalamic area, dorsomedial nucleus, posterior hypothalamic area and nucleus of the fields of Forel. Serotonin-immunoreactivity was also evident in the thick axon bundles in the lateral hypothalamus. The distribution pattern of these cells was quite similar to that of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which catalyses the conversion of 5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and that of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopamine. However, we failed to demonstrate serotonin-immunoreactivity in these parvocellular neurons without monoamine oxidase inhibitor. It is possible that 5-hydroxytryptophan is decarboxylated to serotonin by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase but rapidly degraded by monoamine oxidase-A, the enzyme which preferentially deaminates serotonin. In contrast, serotonin-immunostaining was always demonstrable after intrahypothalamic injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan without monoamine oxidase inhibitor in magnocellular neurons located in the ventrolateral posterior hypothalamus and which contain exclusively monoamine oxidase-B and histidine decarboxylase. It appears that in these cells and axons, serotonin, possibly formed by histidine decarboxylase, is not rapidly oxidized by monoamine oxidase-B.

Suppressed neurotransmitter tone in the raphe nucleus (RN)-prefrontal cortex (PFC) serotonergic pathway and in the locus coeruleus (LC)-PFC noradrenergic pathway underlies depressive- and impulsive-like behavioral deficits respectively. We examined possible mechanisms leading to the monoamine dysfunction in brainstem efferents, namely modulatory effects of the neuropeptide galanin on serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) signaling. SE was induced in young adult male Wistar rats by LiCl and pilocarpine. Epileptic rats were categorized vis-Ã -vis behavioral deficits as not impaired, ""depressed"" and ""impulsive"". Depressive- and impulsive-like behaviors were examined in the forced swimming test (FST).

OBJECTIVE: Based on our finding of a phosphatase-null de novo mutation in PTPRG associated with a case of sporadic schizophrenia, we used PTPRG knockout (KO) mice to model the effect of a loss-of-function mutation. We compared the results with loss-of-function in its close paralogue PTPRZ, previously associated with schizophrenia. We tested PTPRG (-/-) , PTPRZ (-/-) , and wild-type male mice for effects on social behavior, forced swim test, and anxiety, as well as on regional brain neurochemistry. RESULTS: The most notable behavioral consequences of PTPRG gene inactivation were reduced immobilization in the forced swim test, suggestive of some negative symptoms of schizophrenia. By contrast, PTPRZ (-/-) mice demonstrated marked social alteration with increased aggressivity, reminiscent of some positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Both knockouts showed elevated dopamine levels in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and most particularly amygdala, but not striatum, accompanied by reduced dopamine beta hydroxylase activity only in amygdala. In addition, PTPRG KO elicited a distinct increase in hippocampal serotonin level not observed in PTPRZ KO.

Here we examined whether the social encounter stimulation induces abnormal behavior during withdrawal in chronic methamphetamine-treated mice. METHODS: To induce methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization, male mice were injected with methamphetamine (1 mg/kg) once daily for 7 days. RESULTS: The encounter with an intruder elicited hyperactivity 24 h after the last injection of methamphetamine in methamphetamine-sensitized mice. This response was observed even as long as 2 weeks after withdrawal of methamphetamine. The encounter increased c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus and ventral tegmental area in methamphetamine-sensitized mice, while it did not in control mice. Furthermore, the encounter increased extracellular serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine, but not noradrenaline, levels in the prefrontal cortex in methamphetamine-sensitized mice. Local injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and 6-hydroxydopamine into the prefrontal cortex attenuated encounter-induced hyperactivity in methamphetamine-sensitized mice and it markedly decreased prefrontal 5-HT and dopamine levels, respectively. Pharmacological analysis showed that the encounter-induced hyperactivity is mediated by dopamine D1 receptors and 5-HT2A receptors and attenuated by anxiolytics and antidepressants such as diazepam, osemozotan and selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors. The effect of paroxetine was blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist azasetron.

DARPP-32 likely influences dopamine-mediated behaviors in animal models of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic effects of pharmacological treatment. Areas covered: We will review animal studies on the biochemical and behavioral roles of DARPP-32 in drug addiction, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. In general, under physiological and pathophysiological conditions, DARPP-32 in D1 receptor expressing (D1R) -medium spiny neurons (MSNs) promotes dopamine/D1 receptor/PKA signaling, whereas DARPP-32 in D2 receptor expressing (D2R)-MSNs counteracts dopamine/D2 receptor signaling. However, the function of DARPP-32 is differentially regulated in acute and chronic phases of drug addiction; DARPP-32 enhances D1 receptor/PKA signaling in the acute phase, whereas DARPP-32 suppresses D1 receptor/PKA signaling in the chronic phase through homeostatic mechanisms. Therefore, DARPP-32 plays a bidirectional role in dopamine neurotransmission, depending on the cell type and experimental conditions, and is involved in dopamine-related behavioral abnormalities. Expert opinion: DARPP-32 differentially regulates dopamine signaling in D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and a shift of balance between D1R- and D2R-MSN function is associated with behavioral abnormalities. An adjustment of this imbalance is achieved by therapeutic approaches targeting DARPP-32-related signaling molecules.",,England,2017,10.1080/14728222.2017.1279149,Journal Article and Review,D1 receptor and D2 receptor and DARPP-32 and dopamine and drug addiction,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28052701

Both LY3020371 and ketamine increased the number of spontaneously active dopamine cells in the ventral tegmental area of anesthetized rats, increased O(2) in the anterior cingulate cortex, promoted wakefulness, enhanced the efflux of biogenic amines in the prefrontal cortex, and produced antidepressant-related behavioral effects in rodent models. The ability of LY3020371 to produce antidepressant-like effects in the forced-swim assay in rats was associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drug levels that matched concentrations required for functional antagonist activity in native rat brain tissue preparations.

DISC1 is a scaffold protein interacting with proteins involved in the dopamine system. Here we summarise the impact of DISC1 disruption on the dopamine system in animal models, considering its effects on presynaptic dopaminergic function (tyrosine hydroxylase levels, dopamine transporter levels, dopamine levels at baseline and after amphetamine administration) and postsynaptic dopaminergic function (dopamine D1 and D2 receptor levels, dopamine receptor-binding potential and locomotor activity after amphetamine administration). Our findings show that many but not all DISC1 models display (1) increased locomotion after amphetamine administration, (2) increased dopamine levels after amphetamine administration in the nucleus accumbens, and (3) inconsistent basal dopamine levels, dopamine receptor levels and binding potentials. There is also limited evidence for decreased tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the frontal cortex and increased dopamine transporter levels in the striatum but not nucleus accumbens, but these conclusions warrant further replication. The main dopaminergic findings are seen across different DISC1 models, providing convergent evidence that DISC1 has a role in regulating dopaminergic function. These results implicate dopaminergic dysregulation as a mechanism underlying the increased rate of schizophrenia seen in DISC1 variant carriers, and provide insights into how DISC1, and potentially DISC1-interacting proteins such as AKT and GSK-3, could be used as novel therapeutic targets for schizophrenia.",,United States,2017,10.1038/tp.2016.282,Journal Article and Review and Systematic Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28140405

Here, we used a new genetic rat model with a loss-of-function point mutation in the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene (Slc6a3_N157K) to systematically study the RDoC matrix. First, we examined the impact of the Slc6a3_N157K mutation on monoaminergic signaling. We then performed behavioral tests representing each of the five RDoC domains: negative and positive valence systems, cognitive, social and arousal/regulatory systems. The use of RDoC may be particularly helpful for drug development. We studied the effects of a novel pharmacological approach metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR2/3 antagonism, in DAT mutants in a comparative way with standard medications. Loss of DAT functionality in mutant rats not only elevated subcortical extracellular dopamine concentration but also altered the balance of monoaminergic transmission. DAT mutant rats showed deficits in all five RDoC domains. Thus, mutant rats failed to show conditioned fear responses, were anhedonic, were unable to learn stimulus-reward associations, showed impaired cognition and social behavior, and were hyperactive. Hyperactivity in mutant rats was reduced by amphetamine and atomoxetine, which are well-established medications to reduce hyperactivity in humans. The mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495 also normalized hyperactivity in DAT mutant rats without affecting extracellular dopamine levels.

Static incubates show a time-dependent accumulation of melatonin in the medium; this is significantly increased by stimulation with norepinephrine (NE) (10(-5) M), reaching 300% above control levels after 4 h. Perifused pineal slices show a rapid rise in melatonin release within 12-18 min in response to NE stimulation. This reaches a 3.5-4.5-fold increase in melatonin released within 30 min. Withdrawal of NE is associated with a rapid return to prestimulated levels within 12-18 min. These time-course characteristics compare favorably to those changes seen in vivo. The formation of [14C]melatonin from [14C]-tryptophan shows a linear increase with time. In the presence of NE (10(-5) M), the rate of synthesis is increased, albeit after an initial time lag of at least 30 min. The latter may reflect an N-acetyltransferase-independent mechanism of synthesis and release. In static incubations, propranolol (10(-5) M) inhibited NE-induced melatonin production by about 60%, but prazosin (10(-5) M) had no effect. As dibutyryl cyclic AMP (10(-3) M) stimulated melatonin production, it is concluded that beta-receptors are of primary importance to the control of melatonin production, as in the rat.

Histamine receptors have been the target of efforts to develop pro-cognitive drugs to treat disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Cognitive functions including attention are closely associated with gamma oscillations, a rhythmical electrical activity pattern in the 30-80Â Hz range, which depends on the synchronized activity of excitatory pyramidal cells and inhibitory fast-spiking interneurons. We set out to explore whether histamine has a role in promoting gamma oscillations in the hippocampus. Using in-situ hybridization we demonstrate that histamine receptor subtypes 1, 2 and 3 are expressed in stratum pyramidale of area CA3 in rats. We show that both pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons depolarize and increase action potential firing in response to histamine inÂ vitro. The activation of histamine receptors generates dose-dependent, transient gamma oscillations in area CA3 of the hippocampus - the locus of the gamma rhythm generator. We also demonstrate that this histamine effect is independent of muscarinic receptors. Using specific antagonists we provide evidence that histamine gamma rhythmogenesis specifically depends on the H1 receptor. Histamine also depolarized both pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons and increased membrane resistance in pyramidal cells. The increased membrane resistance is potentially mediated by the inhibition of potassium channels because application of the KCNQ channel opener ICA110381 abolished the oscillations. Taken together our data demonstrate a novel and physiological mechanism for generating gamma oscillations in hippocampus and suggest a role for KCNQ channels in this cognition-relevant brain activity.",,England,2017,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2017.03.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Cognition and Gamma oscillation and Hippocampus and Histamine H1 receptor and KCNQ channel and Schizophrenia,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28274820

OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated whether 5-HT manipulation, through a tryptophan (TRP) depletion by diet in Wistar and Lister Hooded rats, modulates compulsive drinking in schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) and locomotor activity in the open-field test. The levels of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and its metabolite were evaluated, as well as the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptor binding, in different brain regions. METHODS: Wistar rats were selected as high (HD) or low (LD) drinkers according to their SIP behaviour, while Lister hooded rats did not show SIP acquisition.

This work explores hydrogen binding at the backbone carbonyl associated with Î±6Î²2 Trp149. Substituting residue i + 1, Thr150, with its Î±-hydroxy analogue (Tah) attenuates the carbonyl's hydrogen bond accepting ability. At Î±6(T150Tah)Î²2, nicotine shows a 24-fold loss of function, TC299423 shows a modest loss, and acetylcholine shows no effect. Nicotine was further analyzed via a double-mutant cycle analysis utilizing N'-methylnicotinium, which indicated a hydrogen bond in Î±6Î²2 with a Î”Î”G of 2.6 kcal/mol.

The present series of experiments investigated the neural mechanisms underlying an induction of amicable cues that facilitate social approach in male mice of the C57BL/6 (B6) and BALB/c (BALB) strains. Male mice exhibit approach behavior and suppression of territorial scent marking toward amicable counterparts. Exposure of a group-housed mouse that maintains an amicable relationship induced social approach in B6 recipient mice, as expressed by increased preference of stay in proximity and decreased scent marks relevant to those of a single-housed mouse. Nasal administration of oxytocin (OT) to stimulus mice appeared to enhance social approach in B6 recipient mice. Systemic administration of buspirone (5-HT1A agonist) to stimulus mice also increased approach in B6 recipient mice, whereas a nasal OT antagonist infusion followed by systemic buspirone injection of stimulus mice blocked this buspirone-induced approach in B6 recipient mice. BALB mice likely possess an intact signaling system as shown in B6 mice, in which the 5-HT â†’ OT pathway is a primary modulator for social amicable signals. However, BALB mice could not exhibit signal-dependent change in approach behavior. No impairment in olfactory discrimination or approach behavior toward social stimuli was found in BALB mice. It is concluded that social cues for facilitating social approach are eliminated via the 5-HT â†’ OT pathway, and BALB mice as a low social strain have a deficit in recognition of specific signals associated with amicability.

Acute pretreatment with either clomipramine (28.5 mumol/kg, s.c.) or desipramine (85.5 mumol/kg, s.c.) enhanced the analgesia induced by both intrathecally-administered morphine (7.5 nmol) and 5-HT (241 nmol), compared to saline (1 ml/kg) but only desipramine facilitated the effects of intrathecally administered NE (0.49 nmol). The chronic (22 day) administration of both tricyclic antidepressants resulted in loss of the enhancement of the effects of morphine (day 22) and 5-HT (day 15); only desipramine (day 15) abolished the facilitation of NE. In a similar study, acute pretreatment with the non-tricyclic antidepressant inhibitor of the reuptake of NE, nisoxetine, (97.5 mumol/kg, s.c.), amplified the effects of intrathecally administered NE and morphine but not 5-HT-induced analgesia. Although chronic (22 day) treatment with nisoxetine caused a loss of the effects of enhancement of morphine (day 8), there was no effect upon the action of NE and antinociception induced by 5-HT was facilitated (day 22). Receptor binding studies indicated that chronic (22 day) treatment with clomipramine, desipramine or nisoxetine reduced the affinity of opiate [3H]naloxone) receptors in the spinal cord. These results demonstrate that (1) acute treatment with trycyclic antidepressants enhanced analgesia induced by intrathecally injected morphine, and (2) the chronic administration of trycyclic antidepressants resulted in a loss of enhancement of the effects of morphine, given intrathecally, which appeared to be independent of alterations in the activity of NE or 5-HT but may be associated with the development of subsensitive opiate receptors.",,England,1988,10.1016/0028-3908(88)90194-3,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2832778

We examined effects of thyroid hormone administration or production of hypothyroidism with methimazole on receptors associated with regulation of noradrenergic function. Treatment with thyroid hormone increased beta-receptor binding, increased alpha-2 receptor binding, and decreased desipramine binding, opposite to effects of hypothyroidism produced by methimazole.

We recently demonstrated the presence of EPRAP in the mice brain; however, little is known about the function of EPRAP in this tissue. Therefore, we investigated the role of EPRAP in behavior and emotion using behavioral analysis in mice. In this study, we subjected EPRAP-deficient (KO) mice and wild-type C57BL/6 (WT) mice to a battery of behavioral tests. EPRAP-KO mice tended to have shorter latencies to fall in the wire hang test, but had normal neuromuscular strength. EPRAP-KO mice exhibited elevated startle responses and reduced pre-pulse inhibition. Compared with WT mice, EPRAP-KO mice increased depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. These abnormal behaviors partially mimic symptoms of depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. Methylphenidate administration increased locomotor activity less in EPRAP-KO mice than in WT mice. Finally, levels of norepinephrine were reduced in the EPRAP-KO mouse brain.

In the cerebral cortex, imipramine prevented, and lithium reduced, the increase in (Na+, K+)-ATPase associated with repeated injections of yohimbine. Imipramine and yohimbine had synergistic effects on the increased release of norepinephrine and on decreased binding to beta-receptors. Effects on the binding of beta-noradrenergic receptors suggested that imipramine partially reduced stimulation of ATPase by reducing the maximum effect of beta-receptors, while the effect of lithium may have involved a reduction in the exposure of receptors to norepinephrine. Imipramine also increased (Na+, K+)-ATPase in the cerebral cortex of reserpine-treated rats.

RP5063 is an AAPD with a diverse and unique pharmacology, including partial agonism at dopamine (DA) D(2), D(3), D(4), serotonin (5-HT)(1A), and 5-HT(2A) receptors (Rs), full agonism at Î±(4)Î²(2) nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh)R (nAChR), and antagonism at 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(6), and 5-HT(7)Rs. Most atypical APDs are 5-HT(2A) inverse agonists. The efficacy of RP5063 in mouse models of psychosis and episodic memory were studied. RP5063 blocked acute phencyclidine (PCP)-as well as amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, indicating antipsychotic activity. Acute administration of RP5063 significantly reversed subchronic (sc)PCP-induced impairment in novel object recognition (NOR), a measure of episodic memory, but not reversal learning, a measure of executive function. Co-administration of a sub-effective dose (SED) of RP5063 with SEDs of a 5-HT(7)R antagonist, a 5-HT(1B)R antagonist, a 5-HT(2A)R inverse agonist, or an Î±(4)Î²(2) nAChR agonist, restored the ability of RP5063 to ameliorate the NOR deficit in scPCP mice. Pre-treatment with a 5-HT(1A)R, a D(4)R, antagonist, but not an Î±(4)Î²(2) nAChR antagonist, blocked the ameliorating effect of RP5063. Further, co-administration of scRP5063 prior to each dose of PCP prevented the effect of PCP to produce a deficit in NOR for one week. RP5063, given to scPCP-treated mice for one week restored NOR for one week only. Acute administration of RP5063 significantly increased cortical DA efflux, which may be critical to some of its cognitive enhancing properties.

These BDNF-induced adaptations in the VTA are associated with the establishment of aversive withdrawal motivation that leads to a drug-dependent state. Growing evidence suggests that 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling can regulate the expression of BDNF in the brain.

Multiple factors, including psychosocial, genetic, and neurobiological determinants modulate the liability to both aggressive behavior and mental illness. Concerning the latter factors, multiple lines of evidence have shown a dysfunction in the serotonin (5-HT) system occurring in aggressive and in mentally ill individuals. In particular, reduced 5-HT activity has been associated with depression as well as with aggressive behavior, especially with impulsive aggression. Consistently, psychopharmacological interventions aimed at boosting the 5-HT system (e.g., with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in a high percentage of patients with either or both pathological conditions. Current knowledge does not yet allow to clearly disentangle whether 5-HT dysfunction, most often a 5-HT deficiency, is the cause or the consequence of the aggressive/violent behavior, of the underlying mental disease/s, or the expression of the comorbidity. Future studies are thus needed to clarify the association between changes in 5-HT levels, altered activity of 5-HT receptors and their intracellular signaling cascades, and modifications of 5-HT genes, and in particular the neurobiological link between the altered 5-HT machinery and aggressive behavior in the context or in the absence of mental illness.

We investigated the antidepressant-like phenotypic and chemical changes associated with reward-processing dopaminergic systems in rat brains after MFB-DBS. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups: sham-operated, DBS-Off, and DBS-On. For DBS, a concentric bipolar electrode was stereotactically implanted into the right MFB. Exploratory activity and depression-like behavior were evaluated using the open-field and forced-swimming test (FST), respectively. MFB-DBS effects on the dopaminergic system were evaluated using immunoblotting for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), and dopamine receptors (D1-D5), and high-performance liquid chromatography for quantifying dopamine, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), and homovanillic acid (HVA) in brain homogenates of prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, amygdala, and nucleus accumbens (NAc). RESULTS: Animals receiving MFB-DBS showed a significant increase in swimming time without alterations in locomotor activity, relative to the DBS-Off (p<0.039) and sham-operated groups (p<0.014), indicating an antidepressant-like response.

The present study was designed to determine if reserpine-induced supersensitivity could be demonstrated in isolated guinea pig right ventricular strips, if it was associated with beta adrenoceptor proliferation and was specific for beta adrenoceptor agonists. In addition, reserpine dose-dependency of the phenomenon was tested for by using two pretreatment regimens to determine if supersensitivity was the result of direct or possibly toxic effects of reserpine. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with reserpine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days resulted in over 90% depletion of cardiac norepinephrine stores. Supersensitivity to the inotropic effects of isoproterenol, impromidine and forskolin was demonstrated. Associated with the supersensitivity was a significant increase in beta adrenoceptor density. Muscarinic receptor density was actually decreased. This pretreatment regimen also was associated with a significant (30%) drop in body weight suggesting that the phenomenon might be the result of a direct toxic effect of reserpine. Pretreatment of guinea pigs with a lower dose of reserpine (0.03 mg/kg/day) for 7 days produced the same degree of norepinephrine depletion, nonspecific inotropic supersensitivity and beta adrenoceptor proliferation in the absence of a significant reduction in body weight.

In these experiments the serotonergic antagonist metergoline was observed to attenuate both the analgesia induced by the opiate agonist morphine and the analgesia induced by isolation from siblings and the dam, an environmental manipulation which has previously been shown to be associated with increases in opiate activity. In contrast, the opiate antagonist naloxone was observed to be ineffective in blocking not only analgesia induced by the serotonergic agonist quipazine, but also analgesia induced by long-term deprivation from the dam and food, a manipulation that has been previously reported to induce increases in serotonergic utilization. These results suggest that in the neonate, as in the adult, the serotonergic modulation of nociception appears to occur ""downstream"" from the opiate systems serving to regulate nociception following both drug- and environmental-induced alterations in pain sensitivity. Analgesia induced by long-term deprivation from food and the dam appears to be strongly related to increases in serotonergic activity and relatively unaffected by opiate antagonism, whereas analgesia induced by isolation from siblings and the dam may be related to increases in opiate activity, but modulated by serotonergic systems serving to regulate pain responsivity.

Animals exposed to light for 3 hours into the normal dark period showed a similar increase in IPIN binding that was prevented by a single sc injection (0.5 mg/kg) of isoproterenol (ISO). The decrease in IPIN binding observed after middark was prevented both by moving the animals to light at 0200 h and by propranolol administration (20 mg/kg). Likewise, the reduction in IPIN binding was induced in light exposed animals both by ISO administration (in a dose dependent manner) and by injection of norepinephrine (NE) plus the catecholamine uptake blocker desmethylimipramine (DMI). DMI alone was without effect. Chronic denervation of the pineal gland by superior cervical ganglionectomy (SCGx) increased IPIN binding to levels not higher than those observed at middark. The results suggest that rat pineal beta-adrenergic receptors are regulated in a rhythmic 24 hour pattern.

This effect was markedly greater in the liver than the brain. Although the decrease in the rate of brain non-haem iron was slower than that of serum and liver, significant diminutions of behavioral response to apomorphine (2 mg/kg) and maximum [3H]spiperone binding (Bmax) in caudate nucleus were noted in these animals. These effects of ID can be reserved by iron supplementation in young (21-day-old) and adult (48-day-old) rats. In contrast, if ID is induced in new born (10-day-old) animals, the diminished brain non-haem iron, behavioral response to apomorphine and [3H]-spiperone binding in caudate nucleus will not recover even after 6 weeks of iron supplementation. However, these animals have normal serum iron, haemoglobin and liver iron.

Cymbopogon citratus leaf (CC) has been reported to exert anti-depressant effect but its mechanism of action is yet to be elucidated hence, the need for this study. Methods The anti-depressant-like effect of Cymbopogon citratus aqueous leaf was evaluated using forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST) and yohimbine-induced lethality test (YLT) in aggregated mice. Interaction studies involving p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA), an inhibitor of serotonin biosynthesis and yohimbine, Î±(2)-adrenergic receptor antagonist were carried out to evaluate the role of monoaminergic system in the anti-depressant-like effect of CC. The effect of CC on spontaneous motor activity (SMA) was also assessed using activity cage. ResultsCymbopogon citratus (25 and 50â€‰mg/kg, p.o.) demonstrated antidepressant-like activity devoid of significant stimulation of the SMA in mice. However, the antidepressant-like property of CC was significantly (p<0.05) attenuated by pretreatment with yohimbine suggesting involvement of noradrenergic pathway in the action of the extract. Also, pCPA reversed the anti-immobility effect of CC, indicating the role of serotonergic system in the mediation of its antidepressant activity. Moreover, CC (25 and 50â€‰mg/kg) potentiated the lethal effect of yohimbine in aggregated mice, which further suggest the involvement of monoaminergic systems in its action. Conclusions The results of the study showed that C. citratus might be interacting with serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways to mediate its anti-depressant-like effect in mice.",,Germany,2017,10.1055/s-0043-106586,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28499312

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of lobeline on ethanol abstinence-induced depression-like behavior and associated neuroadaptive changes in mice. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were allowed to drink 10% ethanol for 4 weeks using a two-bottle choice procedure. Mice were tested after 24Â h and 14 days of ethanol abstinence in a forced swim test (FST), a measure for depression-like behavior. Acute lobeline treatment (1Â mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time compared to controls after 24Â h and 14 days of abstinence. In addition, abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure reduced serotonin levels in the hippocampus, which was reversed by acute lobeline treatment. Repeated lobeline treatment (1Â mg/kg, once daily) for 14 days during ethanol abstinence also significantly reduced FST immobility in mice exposed to ethanol. Chronic ethanol exposure significantly reduced the number of 5-bromo 2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, indicating decreased hippocampal cell proliferation. Abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure also decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. In contrast, repeated lobeline treatment significantly increased both BrdU- and BDNF-positive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that lobeline produced antidepressant-like effects, likely by targeting brain Î²2-containing nAChRs, serotonergic neurotransmission, and/or hippocampal cell proliferation.

PRL-releasing responses to SAL, Hal, and Hal plus SAL were also examined after a pretreatment to augment central DA using carbidopa (Carbi) and L-dopa. The PRL-releasing response to Hal alone was greater than that to SAL or TRH alone. The PRL-releasing response to Hal plus SAL was similar to that of Hal alone.

A general limitation of receptor-active drugs is the phenomenon of reactive change in receptor numbers. For long-term maintenance treatment, it may be sensible to search for a neuroleptic equivalent of lithium, which has no direct effect on membrane receptors.

Studies in rodents demonstrated that the interaction between OT and serotonin (5-HT) is critical for several aspects of social behavior. Using PET scan in humans, we have recently found that 5-HT 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) function is modified after intranasal oxytocin intake. However, the underlying mechanism between OT and 5-HT remains unclear. To understand this interaction, we tested 3 male macaque monkeys using both [(11)C]DASB and [(18)F]MPPF, two PET radiotracers, marking the serotonin transporter and the 5-HT(1A)R, respectively. Oxytocin (1 IU in 20 Î¼l of ACSF) or placebo was injected into the brain lateral ventricle 45 min before scans. Additionally, we performed postmortem autoradiography. Compared with placebo, OT significantly reduced [(11)C]DASB binding potential in right amygdala, insula, and hippocampus, whereas [(18)F]MPPF binding potential increased in right amygdala and insula. Autoradiography revealed that [(11)C]DASB was sensitive to physiological levels of 5-HT modification, and that OT does not act directly on the 5-HT(1A)R. Our results show that oxytocin administration in nonhuman primates influences serotoninergic neurotransmission via at least two ways: (1) by provoking a release of serotonin in key limbic regions; and (2) by increasing the availability of 5-HT(1A)R receptors in the same limbic areas. Because these two molecules are important for social behavior, our study sheds light on the specific nature of their interaction, therefore helping to develop new mechanisms-based therapies for psychiatric disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Social behavior is largely controlled by brain neuromodulators, such as oxytocin and serotonin. While these are currently targeted in the context of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, a new promising pharmaceutical strategy is to study the interaction between these systems. Here we depict the interplay between oxytocin and serotonin in the nonhuman primate brain. We found that oxytocin provokes the release of serotonin, which in turn impacts on the serotonin 1A receptor system, by modulating its availability. This happens in several key brain regions for social behavior, such as the amygdala and insula. This novel finding can open ways to advance treatments where drugs are combined to influence several neurotransmission networks.",,United States,2017,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0659-17.2017,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",PET scan and nonhuman primate and oxytocin and serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28607170

The majority of experimental evidence supports a central role for brain noradrenaline in mediating the effects of stress and predisposing an organism to stress pathology as well as in producing a well-documented consequence of stress exposure-behavioral depression. This review briefly discusses the noradrenergic (NA) pathways involved, the functioning of NA synapses and their associated receptors and focuses directly upon the effects of stress on NA activity in the brain. These broad categories are discussed in terms of: 1. behavioral versus neurochemical explanations for the effects of stress; 2. the methods used to produce stress; 3. measurement of NA and its major metabolite (""turnover""); 4. regional brain effects of stress; 5. effects of pre-stress alterations in brain NA activity upon subsequent stress-induced brain NA changes; 6. correlation of stress-induced brain NA changes with peripheral manifestations of stress; and 7. predisposing factors in stress-induced neurochemical alterations.",,United States,1985,10.1016/0149-7634(85)90048-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2861590

Middle-aged constant estrous (CE) rats had larger (p less than 0.05) pituitary glands containing more (p less than 0.05) serotonin (5-HT) than those from young females or comparably aged, irregularly cycling rats. Ovariectomy lowered pituitary 5-HT content in middle aged CE rats. In contrast, pituitary weight and 5-HT content were increased in young rats of both sexes bearing subcutaneous, steroid-containing capsules that produced elevated levels of serum estradiol 17 beta. However, exogenous estrogen failed to raise pituitary 5-HT concentrations since pituitary weight increased more than 5-HT levels, even though the total amount of amine was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) compared with controls. These findings suggest that pituitary 5-HT increases during aging regardless of ovarian status and in addition, that total 5-HT content of the gland is increased further in hyperestrogenic states such as CE. Since pituitary adenomas occur more frequently in aged CE rats than in diestrous females or males, it was of interest to determine if 5-HT contributes to the tumorigenic effect of estrogen. Thus, the 5-HT receptor agonists zimelidine or quipazine were administered to ovariectomized rats bearing estrogen containing capsules. Rats treated with drugs had larger pituitaries containing more tumors than those receiving the steroid alone. However, these effects were dependent upon estrogen since pituitary pathology did not increase when ovariectomized rats were given 5-HT neuroleptics without the steroid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,United States,1985,10.1016/0197-4580(85)90026-0,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2862595

A new review has therefore been conducted for TCP in two parts which are written to be read preferably in close conjunction: Part I - pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, drug interactions, toxicology; and Part II - clinical studies with meta-analysis of controlled studies in depression, practice of TCP treatment, place in therapy. Pharmacological data of this review part I characterize TCP as an irreversible and nonselective MAO-A/B inhibitor at low therapeutic doses of 20mg/day with supplementary norepinephrine reuptake inhibition at higher doses of 40-60mg/day. Serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and trace amines, such as the ""endogenous amphetamine"" phenylethylamine, are increased in brain, which leads to changes in neuroplasticity by e.g. increased neurotrophic growth factors and translates to reduced stress-induced hypersecretion of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and positive testing in animal studies of depression. TCP has a pharmacokinetic half-life (t(1/2)) of only 2h which is considerably lower than for most other antidepressant drugs. However, a very long pharmacodynamic half-life of about one week is found because of the irreversible MAO inhibition. New studies show that, except for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2A6, no other drug metabolizing CYP-enzymes are inhibited by TCP at therapeutic doses which defines a low potential of pharmacokinetic interactions in the direction from TCP to other drugs. Insufficient information is available, however, for plasma concentrations of TCP influenced by comedication. More quantitative data are also needed for TCP metabolites such as p-hydroxytranylcypromine and N-acetyltranylcypromine. Pharmacodynamic drug interactions comprise for instance severe serotonin toxicity (SST) with serotonergic drugs and hypertensive crisis with indirect sympathomimetics. Because of the risk of severe food interaction, TCP treatment remains beset with the need for a mandatory tyramine-restricted diet.

AA drugs are associated with severe metabolic side effects of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data also show that risperidone causes bone loss and increases fracture risk in both men and women. There are several potential mechanisms of bone loss from RIS. One is hypogonadism due to hyperprolactinemia from dopamine receptor antagonism. However, many patients have normal prolactin levels; moreover we demonstrated that bone loss from RIS in mice can be blocked by inhibition of Î²-adrenergic receptor activation with propranolol, suggesting the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a pathological role. Further, when, we treated ovariectomized (OVX) and sham operated mice daily for 8weeks with RIS or vehicle we demonstrated that RIS causes significant trabecular bone loss in both sham operated and OVX mice. RIS directly suppressed osteoblast number in both sham and OVX mice, but increased osteoclast number and surface in OVX mice alone, potentially accounting for the augmented bone loss. Thus, hypogonadism alone cannot explain RIS induced bone loss. In the current study, we show that dopamine and RIS are present in the bone marrow compartment and that RIS can exert its effects directly on bone cells via dopamine receptors.

Alpha- or beta-adrenoceptor-mediated responses were examined by construction of cumulative concentration-response curves in the presence of propranolol (10(-6) M) and phentolamine (5 X 10(-6) M) respectively. Stimulation of alpha-adrenoceptors by noradrenaline virtually abolished the twitches from transmural stimulation, but only partially inhibited the carbachol- and potassium-induced contractions. The effects on the last two preparations were attributed to a post-synaptic inhibition at alpha-adrenoceptors on the longitudinal smooth muscle. In the transmurally-stimulated preparation there was an additional pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of cholinergic transmission. The maximum beta-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of all three preparations to noradrenaline and isoprenaline was of the same magnitude and attributed only to a post-synaptic action on longitudinal smooth muscle. The predominant post-synaptic beta-adrenoceptor-mediated (carbachol-contracted ileum) and pre-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated (transmurally-stimulated ileum) relaxations were significantly (P less than 0.05) potentiated by the neuronal uptake inhibitor desmethylimipramine. These receptors may therefore be considered to be closely associated with the sympathetic innervation. The effect on the post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation was equivocal. Additional minor excitatory responses were identified as a direct alpha-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile response to noradrenaline and as a beta-adrenoceptor-mediated potentiation of transmural stimulation by isoprenaline, possibly due to facilitation of cholinergic transmitter release.",,Germany,1985,10.1007/BF00500813,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2869413

Based on the known function of its paralog GluD2 in cerebellum, we searched for a role of GluD1 in slow glutamatergic transmission mediated by metabotropic receptor mGlu1 in midbrain dopamine neurons, whose dysfunction is a hallmark of schizophrenia. We found that an mGlu1 agonist elicits a slow depolarizing current in HEK cells co-expressing mGlu1 and GluD1, but not in cells expressing mGlu1 or GluD1 alone. This current is abolished by additional co-expression of a dominant-negative GluD1 dead pore mutant. We then characterized mGlu1-dependent currents in dopamine neurons from midbrain slices. Both the agonist-evoked and the slow postsynaptic currents are abolished by expression of the dominant-negative GluD1 mutant, pointing to the involvement of native GluD1 channels in these currents. Likewise, both mGlu1-dependent currents are suppressed in GRID1 knockout mice, which reportedly display endophenotypes relevant for schizophrenia. It is known that mGlu1 activation triggers the transition from tonic to burst firing of dopamine neurons, which signals salient stimuli and encodes reward prediction. In vivo recordings of dopamine neurons showed that their spontaneous burst firing is abolished in GRID1 knockout mice or upon targeted expression of the dominant-negative GluD1 mutant in wild-type mice.

Both agents produced an antitremor effect in a dose-dependent manner, with butoxamine showing greater potency than acebutolol. The dose of isoprenaline (0.1 mg/kg) that markedly reduced the effect of butoxamine did not alter the effect of acebutolol, suggesting that antagonism of peripheral beta 1-adrenoceptor was not responsible for the antitremor action of acebutolol and that blockade of peripheral beta 2-receptors is involved to a great extent in the inhibition of tremors by butoxamine. The effect of acebutolol was unaltered in rats pretreated with 5-hydroxytryptophan and p-chlorophenylalanine, which on the other hand produced potentiation and a partial reduction respectively of the action of butoxamine. It appears, therefore, that butoxamine also acts centrally in association with the 5-HT system and that this action is relatively weaker than the peripheral action.

The present study examined the potential contributions of dopamine and opioid signaling to these processes using two different decision-making tasks. In one task, Long Evans Rats chose between working for a preferred food (high-carbohydrate banana-flavored sucrose pellets) by lever pressing on a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement vs. obtaining less preferred laboratory chow that was concurrently available. In a second (effort-free) task, rats chose between the same two reinforcers when they were both available freely. Rats were trained in these tasks before receiving haloperidol (0.00, 0.05, 0.10mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) or naloxone (0.0, 1.5, 3.0mg/kg, i.p.). In the first task, haloperidol decreased breakpoint, lever presses, number of reinforcers earned, and increased chow intake, whereas naloxone decreased breakpoint and number of reinforcers earned but had no effect on chow consumption. In the effort-free task, haloperidol reduced intakes of both foods without affecting preference, whereas naloxone selectively reduced the consumption of banana-pellets. The present findings support converging evidence suggesting that DA signaling affects processes more closely related to appetitive motivation, leaving other components of motivation unchanged. By contrast, opioid signaling appears to mediate aspects of hedonic feeding by selectively altering intakes of highly palatable foods. For preferred foods, both appetitive and consummatory aspects of food intake were altered by opioid receptor antagonism. Our findings argue against a general suppression of appetite by either compound, as appetite manipulations have been shown to unselectively alter intakes of both types of food regardless of the task employed.",,United States,2017,10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.07.019,Journal Article,Decision-making and Dopamine and Eating disorders and Food preference and Motivation and Opioids,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28716608

To date, most ErbB4 studies have focused on GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus and neocortex, particularly fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV+) basket cells. However, NRG has also been shown to modulate DA levels, suggesting a role for ErbB4 signaling in dopaminergic neuron function. Here we report that ErbB4 in midbrain DAergic axonal projections regulates extracellular DA levels and relevant behaviors. Mice lacking ErbB4 in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons, but not in PV+ GABAergic interneurons, exhibit different regional imbalances of basal DA levels and fail to increase DA in response to local NRG1 infusion into the dorsal hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum measured by reverse microdialysis. Using Lund Human Mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells, we show that NRG/ErbB signaling increases extracellular DA levels, at least in part, by reducing DA transporter (DAT)-dependent uptake. Interestingly, TH-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice manifest deficits in learning, spatial and working memory-related behaviors, but not in numerous other behaviors altered in PV-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice. Importantly, microinjection of a Cre-inducible ErbB4 virus (AAV-ErbB4.DIO) into the mesencephalon of TH-Cre;ErbB4(f/f) mice, which selectively restores ErbB4 expression in DAergic neurons, rescues DA dysfunction and ameliorates behavioral deficits.

Responses to equieffective concentrations of phenylephrine (alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist), clonidine and BHT-920, (alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonists), and noradrenaline (nonselective agonist) were inhibited differentially by the calcium antagonist, with the sensitivity order being as follows: BHT-920 = clonidine greater than phenylephrine greater than noradrenaline. When the contractions to two doses of noradrenaline were compared, the low dose response was more sensitive to nitrendipine inhibition than the high dose response. This differential inhibition was not seen for noradrenaline in the presence of verapamil or for phenylephrine in the presence of nitrendipine. The contractions of the vessel to the agonists in zero calcium conditions were not significantly different from each other.

The stimulation of DA autoreceptors by 7-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1 microM 7-OH-DPAT) produced a significant decrease in TH activity extracted from striatal slices maintained under control conditions. This effect was associated with the complete conversion of TH into an enzyme form with a low affinity for its pterin cofactor (Km approximately 0.80 mM). Furthermore, compared to TH extracted from control tissues, that from 7-OH-DPAT-exposed striatal slices was more sensitive to the stimulatory effects of exogenous heparin and cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation. Such changes were opposite to those induced by incubating striatal slices with the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin. Indeed, forskolin treatment completely converted TH into an enzyme form with a high affinity for its pterin cofactor (Km approximately 0.16 mM). Such conversion was associated with a shift in the optimal pH for TH activity from 5.8 (control) to 7.2 (forskolin). Under depolarizing conditions, the blockade by (-)-sulpiride of the stimulation of DA autoreceptors by endogenous DA was associated with a marked activation of TH. Modifications of enzymatic characteristics triggered by (-)-sulpiride were then similar to those induced by forskolin treatment. These data suggest that presynaptic DA autoreceptors modulate the activity of TH by controlling the degree of cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation of the enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,England,1986,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1986.tb00775.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2876053

Adaptive gain theory (AGT; Aston-Jones & Cohen, 2005) suggests that this may reflect an adaptive function of the LC, encouraging search for more remunerative opportunities in times of low utility. Here, we examine whether stimulating LC tonic activity using designer receptors (DREADDs) promotes searching for better opportunities in a patch-foraging task as the value of a patch diminishes. The task required rats to decide repeatedly whether to exploit an immediate but depleting reward within a patch or to incur the cost of a time delay to travel to a new, fuller patch. Similar to behavior associated with high LC tonic activity in other tasks, we found that stimulating LC tonic activity impaired task performance, resulting in reduced task participation and increased response times and omission rates. However, this was accompanied by a more specific, predicted effect: a significant tendency to leave patches earlier, which was best explained by an increase in decision noise rather than a systematic bias to leave earlier (i.e., at higher values). This effect is consistent with the hypothesis that high LC tonic activity favors disengagement from current behavior, and the pursuit of alternatives, by augmenting processing noise.

The present study aims to explore the beneficial effects of folic acid on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like behaviors and its possible mechanisms. The behavioral tests including open-field test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test were used to evaluate the antidepressant effects of folic acid. Then the changes of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) expression levels, and synaptic organization were assessed to explore the antidepressant mechanisms of folic acid. Our results showed that CUMS caused significant depression-like behaviors, neuropathological changes, and decreased brain 5-HT concentration, BDNF, and GluR1 expression in the hippocampus and association cortex. In conclusion, the results showed that folic acid significantly improved depression-like behaviors in CUMS-induced rats, and its antidepressant effects might be related to the increase of brain 5-HT concentration, BDNF and GluR1 expression, and repair of synaptic organization in the brain.",,England,2017,10.1097/WNR.0000000000000887,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28906345

Additionally, a gain-of-function mutation in CACNA1C is responsible for the neurodevelopmental disorder Timothy syndrome that presents with prominent behavioral features on the autism spectrum. Given an emerging role for serotonin in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we investigate the relationship between Cav1.2 and the ascending serotonin system in the Timothy syndrome type 2 (TS2-neo) mouse, which displays behavioral features consistent with the core triad of ASD. We find that TS2-neo mice exhibit enhanced serotonin tissue content and axon innervation of the dorsal striatum, as well as decreased serotonin turnover in the amygdala. These regionally specific alterations are accompanied by an enhanced active coping response during acute stress (forced swim), serotonin neuron Fos activity in the caudal dorsal raphe, and serotonin type 1A receptor-dependent feedback inhibition of the rostral dorsal raphe nuclei. Collectively, these results suggest that the global gain-of-function Cav1.2 mutation associated with Timothy syndrome has pleiotropic effects on the ascending serotonin system including neuroanatomical changes, regional differences in forebrain serotonin metabolism and feedback regulatory control mechanisms within the dorsal raphe. Altered activity of the ascending serotonin system continues to emerge as a common neural signature across several ASD mouse models, and the capacity for Cav1.2 L-type calcium channels to impact both serotonin structure and function has important implications for several neuropsychiatric conditions.",,France,2017,10.1111/ejn.13707,Journal Article,5-hydroxytryptamine-type 1A receptor and autism and dorsal raphe nucleus and neurodevelopment and serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-28921675

An ""optimal"" level of D2 receptor blockade with antipsychotics is thought to ameliorate the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. However, persistent D2 receptor blockade is associated with a deteriorating clinical response in a subset of patients. Interestingly, antipsychotics with a weaker D2 receptor binding profile appear somewhat superior in this respect. This evidence challenges the hypothesis that D2 receptor blockade is the sole mechanism of antipsychotic efficacy and points to consistent inter-individual responses to antipsychotic treatment. Here, we hypothesize that clinically effective doses of antipsychotics would lead to the formation of a D2 receptor ""reserve"" that is likely composed of presynaptic dopamine D2 autoreceptors. The majority of the remaining postsynaptic dopamine receptors are instead occupied by antipsychotics. Endogenous dopamine would then mainly interact with this D2 autoreceptor reserve, thereby reducing the presynaptic synthesis and release of dopamine and resulting in an indirect antipsychotic effect.

A greater number of cells responded to noradrenaline (NA) (30-66 nA) than to beta-phenylethylamine (PE) (30-100 nA). When responses were obtained to both, 90% of the neurones gave the same response to NA and PE. Applications of PE with small currents (0-12 nA) caused an increase in the response to NA without affecting the baseline firing rate or the response to acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA or 5-hydroxytryptamine. An increase was seen in both excitatory and inhibitory responses to NA. The enhancement lasted up to 39 minutes after the end of the PE application. Applications of NA with small currents (0-3 nA) failed to alter responses to NA. Possible mechanisms of the effect of PE on response to NA are discussed.

It has recently been found to have antidepressant effects and is a drug of abuse, suggesting it may have dopaminergic effects. To examine the effect of ketamine on the dopamine systems, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of dopamine measures in the rodent, human and primate brain following acute and chronic ketamine administration relative to a drug-free baseline or control condition. Systematic search of PubMed and PsychInfo electronic databases yielded 40 original peer-reviewed studies. There were sufficient rodent studies of the acute effects of ketamine at sub-anaesthetic doses for meta-analysis. Acute ketamine administration in rodents is associated with significantly increased dopamine levels in the cortex (Hedge's g= 1.33, P<0.01), striatum (Hedge's g=0.57, P<0.05) and the nucleus accumbens (Hedge's g=1.30, P<0.05) compared to control conditions, and 62-180% increases in dopamine neuron population activity. Sub-analysis indicated elevations were more marked in in vivo (g=1.93) than ex vivo (g=0.50) studies. There were not enough studies for meta-analysis in other brain regions studied (hippocampus, ventral pallidum and cerebellum), or of the effects of chronic ketamine administration, although consistent increases in cortical dopamine levels (from 88 to 180%) were reported in the latter studies. In contrast, no study showed an effect of anaesthetic doses (>100â€‰mgâ€‰kg(-1)) of ketamine on dopamine levels ex vivo, although this remains to be tested in vivo. Findings in non-human primates and in human studies using positron emission tomography were not consistent. The studies reviewed here provide evidence that acute ketamine administration leads to dopamine release in the rodent brain. We discuss the inter-species variation in the ketamine induced dopamine release as well as the implications for understanding psychiatric disorders, in particular substance abuse, schizophrenia, and the potential antidepressant properties of ketamine, and comparisons with stimulants and other NMDA antagonists.

Drugs abused by humans (e.g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e.g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U-50,488, tifluadom, and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation.

We have previously identified Shati/Nat8l, an N-acetyltransferase, in the brain using an animal model of psychosis. Shati/Nat8l synthesizes N-acetylaspartate from L-aspartate and acetyl-coenzyme A. Further, N-acetylaspartate is converted into N-acetylaspartylglutamate, a neurotransmitter for metabotropic glutamate receptor 3. METHODS: Because Shati/Nat8l mRNA levels were increased in the dorsal striatum of mice following the exposure to forced swimming stress, Shati/Nat8l was overexpressed in mice by the microinjection of adeno-associated virus vectors containing Shati/Nat8l gene into the dorsal striatum (dS-Shati/Nat8l mice). The dS-Shati/Nat8l mice were further assessed using behavioral and neurochemical tests. RESULTS: The dS-Shati/Nat8l mice exhibited behavioral despair in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests and social withdrawal in the 3-chamber social interaction test. These depression-like behaviors were attenuated by the administration of a metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 antagonist and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Furthermore, the metabolism of N-acetylaspartate to N-acetylaspartylglutamate was decreased in the dorsal striatum of the dS-Shati/Nat8l mice. This finding corresponded with the increased expression of glutamate carboxypeptidase II, an enzyme that metabolizes N-acetylaspartylglutamate present in the extracellular space. Extracellular serotonin levels were lower in the dorsal striatum of the dS-Shati/Nat8l and normal mice that were repeatedly administered a selective glutamate carboxypeptidase II inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the striatal expression of N-acetylaspartate synthetase Shati/Nat8l plays a role in major depressive disorder via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 3-mediated functional control of the serotonergic neuronal system.",,England,2017,10.1093/ijnp/pyx078,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Shati/Nat8l and behavioral despair and mGluR3 and serotonin and social withdrawal,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29020418

Because the serotonergic toxicity associated with the MDMA analog methamphetamine has been linked previously to endogenous dopamine and because MDMA, like methamphetamine, elicits pronounced dopamine release in vitro, we have examined the role of endogenous dopamine in both the immediate (3 hr) and longer-term (3 days) central serotonergic deficits induced by systemic MDMA administration to rats. Depletion of central dopamine content with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or reserpine, or selective destruction of nigrostriatal dopamine projections with bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced substantia nigral lesions, partially blocked the immediate MDMA-induced reduction in rat striatal tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity. In addition, the longer-term TPH deficits caused by a high single dose of MDMA were completely prevented by prior alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine or reserpine, and attenuated significantly by inhibition of dopamine uptake with the selective dopamine-uptake blocker GBR 12909. These results implicate endogenous drug-released dopamine as a partial mediator of the initial decrease in TPH activity caused by MDMA and as an important prerequisite to the development of long-term MDMA-induced neurotoxicity.

Mutations and polymorphisms in GRIN2A gene, coding for GluN2A, are linked to developmental brain disorders such as mental retardation, epilepsy, schizophrenia. Published data suggest that GluN2A is involved in maturation and phenotypic maintenance of parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs), and these interneurons suffer from a deficient glutamatergic neurotransmission via GluN2A-containing NMDARs in schizophrenia. In the present study, we find that although PVIs and their associated perineuronal nets (PNNs) appear normal in anterior cingulate cortex of late adolescent/young adult GRIN2A KO mice, a lack of GluN2A delays PNN maturation. GRIN2A KO mice display a susceptibility to redox dysregulation as sub-threshold oxidative stress and subtle alterations in antioxidant systems are observed in their prefrontal cortex. Consequently, an oxidative insult applied during early postnatal development increases oxidative stress, decreases the number of parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells, and weakens the PNNs in KO but not WT mice. These effects are long-lasting, but preventable by the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. The persisting oxidative stress, deficit in PVIs and PNNs, and reduced local high-frequency neuronal synchrony in anterior cingulate of late adolescent/young adult KO mice, which have been challenged by an early-life oxidative insult, is accompanied with microglia activation. Altogether, these indicate that a lack of GluN2A-containing NMDARs alters the fine control of redox status, leading to a delayed maturation of PNNs, and conferring vulnerability for long-term oxidative stress, microglial activation, and PVI network dysfunction.",,United States,2018,10.1016/j.nbd.2017.10.006,Journal Article,Anterior cingulate cortex and Glutahione and Microglia and Mouse and Oscillations and Oxidative stress and Parvalbumin interneuron and Perineuronal net and Peroxiredoxin and Sulfiredoxin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29024713

Other atypical antipsychotics (thioridazine, mesoridazine, melperone) increased dopamine release at only one dose tested but increased dopamine metabolism at most doses. Antipsychotic agents associated with extrapyramidal side effects (setoperone, perlapine, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and metoclopramide) increased dopamine release and metabolism at almost every dose tested. Thus, atypical antipsychotics increase the metabolism but not release of dopamine at behaviorally effective doses.

Some of the compounds had potent antihypertensive activity in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In pithed rats they antagonized the pressor effect induced by 5-HT in doses 100-1000 times lower than doses needed to antagonize the pressor effect of phenylephrine.

The peripheral administration of buspirone, and its injection into the dorsal raphe nucleus, lead to an increased time spent in the white area associated with enhanced exploratory behaviour with a decreased incidence of rearings and line crossings in the black section. In contrast, the injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raphe nucleus increased exploratory behaviour in the black section with decreased activity in the white area: the effects of 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine were antagonized by buspirone administered peripherally. Ritanserin, methysergide, metergoline and cyproheptadine failed, in non-sedative doses, to influence exploratory behaviour in the two-compartment system and ritanserin and methysergide also failed to antagonize the effects caused by 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. It is concluded that in the mouse model the ability of buspirone to reduce the aversive response to a brightly illuminated area may reflect an anxiolytic action, that the dorsal raphe nucleus may be an important locus of action, and that the effects of buspirone may reflect an interaction at 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors.",,England,1988,10.1111/j.2042-7158.1988.tb05284.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2904990

This selectivity was considerably greater than that observed for other beta-adrenoceptor ligands including propranolol (5-HT1A/5-HT1B ratio = 2), oxpenolol (3.5) and cyanopindolol (8.7). The 5-HT1B activity of the compound resided in the (-)-enantiomer. (-)-Isamoltane had weak activity (IC50 3-10 mumol/l) at 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The compound was devoid of activity at a number of other central neurotransmitter recognition sites including the 5-HT1C site. Isamoltane increased the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT from prelabeled rat cortical slices in a manner similar to that of cyanopindolol. While both compounds were similar in potency to methiothepin, they had lower efficacy. Oxprenolol was less potent that both isamoltane and cyanopindolol while propranolol was essentially inactive. The effects of the compounds on 5-HT release appeared to be correlated with their 5-HT1B rather than 5-HT1A activity. In vivo, isamoltane increased 5-HTP accumulation in rat cortex following central decarboxylase inhibition at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg i.p. At higher doses this effect was gradually diminished. Similar, but less clearcut results were obtained with cyanopindolol and oxprenolol, but propranolol was ineffective. No changes in brain tryptophan levels were associated with the isamoltane-evoked changes in brain 5-HTP levels. In reserpinized animals, isamoltane reduced 5-HTP accumulation even at doses which enhanced accumulation of this metabolite when given alone.

The possibility that isamoltane and the other beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are antagonists at 5-HT1B receptors and that their effect on 5-HT synthesis in vivo is the net result of their agonist/antagonist effects at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors is discussed in relation to the potential mechanism of the anxiolytic activity of isamoltane.",,Germany,1988,10.1007/BF00175785,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2905765

In contrast, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, is associated with acute and neurodevelopmental propsychotic side effects through its interaction with central cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs). CB1R stimulation in the ventral hippocampus (VHipp) potentiates affective memory formation through inputs to the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system, thereby altering emotional salience attribution. These changes in DA activity and salience attribution, evoked by dysfunctional VHipp regulatory actions and THC exposure, could predispose susceptible individuals to psychotic symptoms. Although THC can accelerate the onset of schizophrenia, CBD displays antipsychotic properties, can prevent the acquisition of emotionally irrelevant memories, and reverses amphetamine-induced neuronal sensitization through selective phosphorylation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) molecular signaling pathway. This review summarizes clinical and preclinical evidence demonstrating that distinct phytocannabinoids act within the VHipp and associated corticolimbic structures to modulate emotional memory processing through changes in mesolimbic DA activity states, salience attribution, and signal transduction pathways associated with schizophrenia-related pathology.",,Germany,2018,10.1007/s00213-017-4766-7,Journal Article and Review,Cannabidiol and Dopamine and Emotional salience and Endocannabinoid and Memory and Psychosis and Rapamycin and Schizophrenia and THC,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29063964

By convention this is regarded as a sympathomimetic response, however, recent studies suggest trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) involvement. There is also uncertainty whether these amines also release nitric oxide (NO) causing opposing vasodilatation. These questions were addressed in guinea-pig isolated aorta, a species not previously examined. Guinea-pig aortic rings were set up to measure contractile tension. Cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for the reference Î±-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, PEA or d-amphetamine before and in the presence of vehicles, the Î±(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (1ÂµM), the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(Ï‰)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NAME), or NO scavengers, curcumin and astaxanthin. Prazosin inhibited phenylephrine contractions with low affinity consistent with Î±(1L)-adrenoceptors. However, PEA and amphetamine were not antagonised, indicating non-adrenergic responses probably via TAARs. L-NAME potentiated contractions to PEA both in the absence and presence of prazosin, indicating that PEA releases NO to cause underlying opposing vasodilatation, independent of Î±(1)-adrenoceptors. L-NAME also potentiated amphetamine and phenylephrine. PEA was potentiated by the NO scavenger astaxanthin but less effectively. Curcumin, an active component of turmeric, however, inhibited PEA. Trace amines therefore constrict blood vessels non-adrenergically with an underlying NO-mediated non-adrenergic vasodilatation.

In the rat hypothalamus it has been reported that the density of these sites is increased in the dark period of the day, and this could result in an alteration in the release of 5-HT. The electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT was thus studied in preloaded hypothalamic slices prepared from rats kept under 12:12 h light/dark or dark/light schedules. The fractional release of [3H]5-HT evoked by electrical stimulation, but not by the 5-HT releasing agent fenfluramine, was significantly decreased during the dark period when compared with the light period. The effects of the 5-HT reuptake blocker citalopram, of the two 5-HT autoreceptor agonists 5-methoxytryptamine and RU 24969, and of the 5-HT autoreceptor antagonist methiothepin on the release of [3H]5-HT were the same in both groups of rats. In conclusion, the release of [3H]5-HT from prelabelled rat hypothalamic slices is decreased during the dark period of the day. This modification is not reflected by changes in the effects of citalopram, an inhibitor of 5-HT reuptake, to modify the overflow of [3H]5-HT.

Therefore, the environmental presence of psychopharmaceuticals, such as fluoxetine (FLU), are likely to interact with fish serotonergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic systems, affecting their response and associated biological functions. Hence, the present work aimed at evaluating the effects of FLU in the transcription of genes involved in serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic transporters and receptors signalling in early stages of Danio rerio development. Embryos (1 hpf) were exposed for 80Â h to different concentrations of FLU (0.0015, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 0.8Â Î¼M) and mRNA levels of sert, 5-ht1a, 5-ht2c, dat, drd1b, drd2b, net, adra2a, adra2b, adra2c, vmat and mao were evaluated. A sensorimotor reflex assay was also performed demonstrating a significant decrease in tail reflex at 0.1 and 0.5Â Î¼M. The transcription levels of serotonergic and dopaminergic transporters (sert and dat) and vmat were down-regulated at environmentally relevant concentration (0.0015Â Î¼M). Receptors 5-ht2c, drd2b adra2b and adra2c mRNA levels also displayed a down regulation pattern after FLU exposure. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the interaction of FLU with the neurotransmission system at environmentally relevant concentrations by changing transcription patterns. Therefore, given the importance of these signalling pathways it is possible that their disruption can ultimately disturb the escape behaviour and biological functions in fish.

The GABA-A receptor (Î² and Ï1 subunits) is modulated by dopamine (DA) and, interestingly, GABAÏ1 can be modulated by several biogenic amines. Here we explored the effects of the metabolites of the dopaminergic pathway and other structural analogues of DA on GABAÏ1 and the DA gated ion channel (LGC-53) from Caenorhabditis elegans expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our findings show an antagonistic effect of the metabolite 3-Methoxytyramine (3-MT, IC(50)â€‰=â€‰285â€‰Â±â€‰30â€‰ÂµM) with similar potency compared to DA on induced GABA currents; however, it was inactive on LGC-53.

Gestational intake of valproic acid (VPA) is linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterized by impaired sociability and stereotypies. VPA effects on the neurochemistry and functional morphology of the histaminergic system in ASD are unclear. Zebrafish are highly social, and given the similarities between zebrafish and human neurotransmitter systems, we have studied the effects of VPA on histamine in zebrafish. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Histaminergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems of larval and adult zebrafish exposed to VPA from the end of gastrulation until neural tube formation were studied using HPLC, quantitative PCR, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Sociability, dark-flash response and locomotion were also studied. KEY RESULTS: Zebrafish larvae exposed to VPA showed decreased locomotion and an abnormal dark-flash response. Additionally, a reduced number of histaminergic neurons, low histamine and altered mRNA expression of key genes of the monoaminergic systems were also detected. The reduced mRNA expression of genes of the studied systems persisted until adulthood. Furthermore, adult VPA-exposed animals presented lower brain levels of noradrenaline and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, along with impaired sociability. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: VPA exposure in early development causes molecular and neurochemical alterations in zebrafish, which persist into adulthood and accompany impaired sociability. These findings will highlight the possible involvement of the histaminergic system in outcomes related to neuropsychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it supports zebrafish as a tool to investigate mechanisms underlying these disorders.",,England,2018,10.1111/bph.14124,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29235100

Among the different existing receptor subtypes, the homomeric Î±7 nAChR has attracted considerable attention because of its possible implication in several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. Allosteric modulators of ligand-gated ion channels are of particular interest as therapeutic agents, as they modulate receptor activity without affecting normal fluctuations of synaptic neurotransmitter release. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy of Î±7-acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a humanized chimera of a snail AChBP, which has 71% sequence similarity with the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the human Î±7 nAChR, to investigate the structural determinants of allosteric modulation. We extended previous observations that an allosteric site located in the vestibule of the receptor offers an attractive target for receptor modulation. We introduced seven additional humanizing mutations in the vestibule-located binding site of AChBP to improve its suitability as a model for studying allosteric binding. Using a fragment-based screening approach, we uncovered an allosteric binding site located near the Î²8-Î²9 loop, which critically contributes to coupling ligand binding to channel opening in human Î±7 nAChR. This work expands our understanding of the topology of allosteric binding sites in AChBP and, by extrapolation, in the human Î±7 nAChR as determined by electrophysiology measurements.

Decreased levels of ÃŸ-PEA receptor, trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR-1), and postsynaptic DA D2 (D2L) receptor accompanied these alterations. Drug-naive PKO rats displayed normal locomotor activity; however, they displayed decreased locomotor response to a low dose of psychostimulant methamphetamine, suggesting altered DAergic neurotransmission in the striatum when challenged with an indirect agonist.

The present review surveys what is currently known about the interactions of CB1Rs with dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate systems, because all three of those neurotransmitters are well-established in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and psychosis. Identification of molecular mechanisms underlying the pro-psychotic effects of SCB drugs of abuse may establish certain classes of these substances as particularly dangerous, guiding regulations to control availability of these drugs.

Furthermore, CRS mice treated with VBFW exhibited a significantly decreased immobility time in FST and serum CORT, increased locomotor activity in OFT, and enhanced brain monoamine neurotransmitters. Similarly, VBFW significantly upregulated the ERKs/Akt signaling pathway in the hippocampus and PFC.

The dopaminergic system is involved in several neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. This complex system features multiple pathways implicated in emotion and cognition, psychomotor functions and endocrine control through activation of G protein-coupled dopamine receptors. This review focuses on the system-wide effects of dopaminergic agents on the multiple biochemical and endocrine pathways, in particular the biomarkers (i.e., indicators of a pharmacological process) that reflect these effects. Dopaminergic treatments developed over the last decades were found to be associated with numerous biochemical pathways in the brain, including the norepinephrine and the kynurenine pathway. Additionally, they have shown to affect peripheral systems, for example the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Dopaminergic agents thus have a complex and broad pharmacological profile, rendering drug development challenging. Considering the complex system-wide pharmacological profile of dopaminergic agents, this review underlines the needs for systems pharmacology studies that include: i) proteomics and metabolomics analysis; ii) longitudinal data evaluation and mathematical modeling; iii) pharmacokinetics-based interpretation of drug effects; iv) simultaneous biomarker evaluation in the brain, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma; and v) specific attention to condition-dependent (e.g., disease) pharmacology.

Since organisms are able to learn which environmental cues can cease an aversive event, relief learning helps to better cope with future aversive events. Literature data suggest that relief learning is affected in various psychopathological conditions, such as anxiety disorders. Here, we investigated the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system in relief learning. Using a relief learning procedure in Sprague Dawley rats, we applied a combination of behavioral experiments with anatomical tracing, c-Fos immunohistochemistry, and local chemogenetic and pharmacological interventions to broadly characterize the role of the mesolimbic dopamine system. The present study shows that a specific part of the mesolimbic dopamine system, the projection from the posterior medial ventral tegmental area (pmVTA) to the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), is activated by aversive electric stimuli. 6-OHDA lesions of the pmVTA blocked relief learning but fear learning and safety learning were not affected. Chemogenetic silencing of the pmVTA-AcbSh projection using the DREADD approach, as well as intra-AcbSh injections of the dopamine D2/3 receptor antagonist raclopride inhibited relief learning. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that the dopaminergic pmVTA-AcbSh projection is critical for relief learning but not for similar learning phenomena. This novel finding may have clinical implications since the processing of signals predicting relief and safety is often impaired in patients suffering from anxiety disorders.

Prolonged L-dopa administration counteracted the increased density of (3H)-spiroperidol binding sites but further enhanced the hypersensitivity of adenylate cyclase to DA and decreased the inhibitory effect of opiates on this enzyme. The apomorphine-induced contralateral rotations were also strongly potentiated. On the contrary the binding of (3H)-SCH-23390 was affected neither by DA nerve degeneration nor by chronic L-dopa treatment. These results suggest that DA-D1 and DA-D2 receptors are differently affected by prolonged L-dopa treatment. The biochemical changes of DA-D1 receptors associated with adenylate cyclase seem to be correlated with the enhanced behavioural responses to apomorphine and could be a consequence of a decreased opiate inhibitory tone on the enzyme.

In the latter case, it was shown that 3H-5-HT binding to 5-HT1A sites corresponded to that displaceable by 0.1 microM 8-OH-DPAT or 1 microM spiperone. The ""non-5-HT1A"" sites labeled by 3H-5-HT in the presence of 0.1 microM 8-OH-DPAT corresponded mainly to 5-HT1B sites. 5-HT1A binding was notably high in limbic regions (dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, lateral septum, frontal cortex), whereas 5-HT1B binding was particularly concentrated in extrapyramidal areas (caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, substantia nigra).

The effects of lesions in the parafascicular-intralaminar nuclei on D2 dopamine receptors and high affinity dopamine uptake.,Kilpatrick IC and Jones MW and Pycock CJ and Riches I and Phillipson OT ,Neuroscience,,"Dopamine receptor binding in the caudate-putamen was studied following bilateral lesions of the thalamostriatal pathway. Receptor binding was assayed using [3H]spiperone and defined with both (+)-butaclamol and S(-)-sulpiride. Radiofrequency lesions resulted in an increase in the Bmax of [3H]spiperone binding defined with both (+)-butaclamol and S(-)-sulpiride between 7 and 14 days following surgery. At longer survival times a fluctuating response was seen in which a decrease in receptor binding was observed at 28 days following lesion and a further rise again at 70 days. At no time point was significant change in Kd recorded. Further experiments were carried out to control for the possible effects of damage to fibres of passage and for inadvertent damage to habenula, as well as to define the receptor subtype involved. Ibotenic acid lesions resulted in similar effects to those reported with the radiofrequency method. Thus, 7 days following lesion, Bmax for (+)-butaclamol-defined [3H]spiperone binding increased by approximately 14-20% over that recorded in sham-lesioned animals. Using S(-)-sulpiride to define binding, Bmax was found to increase 13-17% in the same membrane preparations. Similar results were obtained in experiments at 14 days following ibotenic acid induced lesions. Again, no change in Kd was recorded. When radiofrequency lesions were made, which were largely restricted to habenula and associated fibres of passage, only small [(+)-butaclamol defined] or insignificant [S(-)-sulpiride defined] changes in Bmax were recorded. Combined radiofrequency lesions of habenula and ibotenic acid lesions of the thalamus resulted in a larger increase in Bmax for (+)-butaclamol defined binding than with S(-)-sulpiride defined binding. Our interpretation of these findings, in the light of the histology of the lesions, is that the predominant effect of removing thalamic input to the caudate-putamen is an increase in the number of D2 receptors, but without any change of affinity. A small component of the change in Bmax defined with (+)-butaclamol found with radiofrequency lesions may be due to a response at non-dopamine sites (possibly a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype) following damage to other caudate-putamen afferents which pass near the habenula or fasciculus retroflexus. Following unilateral ibotenic acid lesions of the thalamus, the number of high affinity uptake sites for dopamine was increased at long survival times.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,United States,1986,10.1016/0306-4522(86)90311-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2948134

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this action are poorly understood. Here we report a presynaptic glutamate/cannabinoid mechanism that may underlie this action. Systemic or intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) administration of the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) dose-dependently reduced cocaine (and sucrose) self-administration and cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior. The reduction in cocaine-taking and cocaine-seeking was associated with a reduction in cocaine-enhanced extracellular glutamate, but not cocaine-enhanced extracellular dopamine (DA) in the NAc. MPEP alone, when administered systemically or locally into the NAc, elevated extracellular glutamate, but not DA. Similarly, the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, rimonabant, elevated NAc glutamate, not DA. mGluR5s were found mainly in striatal medium-spiny neurons, not in astrocytes, and MPEP-enhanced extracellular glutamate was blocked by a NAc CB1 receptor antagonist or N-type Ca(++) channel blocker, suggesting that a retrograde endocannabinoid-signaling mechanism underlies MPEP-induced glutamate release. This interpretation was further supported by our findings that genetic deletion of CB1 receptors in CB1-knockout mice blocked both MPEP-enhanced extracellular glutamate and MPEP-induced reductions in cocaine self-administration. Together, these results indicate that the therapeutic anti-cocaine effects of mGluR5 antagonists are mediated by elevation of extracellular glutamate in the NAc via an endocannabinoid-CB1 receptor disinhibition mechanism.",,England,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-22087-1,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29487381

We compared the acute (1 day) and long-term (12 days) effects of vmPFC stimulation and fluoxetine on serotonin (5-HT) release and receptor expression in rats. Samples to measure serotonin levels were collected from the hippocampus using microdialysis. Serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) mRNA were measured using in situ hybridization. [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT and [(125)I]cyanopindolol autoradiography were used to measure 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) binding. Our results show that after fluoxetine injections serotonin levels were approximately 150% higher than at baseline. Twelve days later, pre-injection 5-HT extracellular concentration was substantially higher than on day 1. In contrast, serotonin levels following DBS were only 50% higher than at baseline. While pre-stimulation 5-HT on day 12 was significantly higher than on treatment day 1, no stimulation-induced 5-HT peak was recorded. SERT expression in the dorsal raphe was increased after acute fluoxetine and decreased following a single day of DBS. Neither fluoxetine nor DBS administered acutely substantially changed 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) binding. Chronic fluoxetine treatment, however, was associated with a decrease in [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT prefrontal cortex and hippocampus expression.

Experiments were performed to determine: (a.) the ability of several non-specific and subtype-specific DA receptor antagonists to stimulate ALDO secretion, (b.) the subtype DA receptor involved in regulating ALDO secretion, and (c.) if ALDO responses were associated with changes in plasma Na+(pNa), K+(pK), or osmolality (pOsm). Blood samples were withdrawn from carotid arterial catheters in conscious, fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats before and following intra-arterial administration of lactated Ringer's placebo, furosemide (10 mg/kg), or one of several DA receptor antagonists. Furosemide stimulated ALDO, decreased pK, and left pNa and pOsm unchanged. The non-selective DA receptor antagonists metoclopramide (0.2, 0.6 mg/kg), rs-sulpiride (0.2 mg/kg), and haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), and the DA-2 receptor antagonists domperidone (0.1 mg/kg) and s-sulpiride (0.1 mg/kg) each stimulated ALDO, and left pNa, pK, and pOsm unchanged. Conversely, the DA-1 receptor antagonists SCH 23390 (0.03, 0.1 mg/kg) and r-sulpiride (0.1 mg/kg) failed to stimulate ALDO, and left pNa, pK, and pOsm unaltered.

In our previous study, YYO played anxiolytic effects on the mice in several behavioral tests that based on the instinctive responses to novel environments. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects and mechanisms of YYO reversing the anxiety induced by 5-HT2C receptor agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl) piperazine (m-CPP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: m-CPP was administrated to the male ICR mice to develop an anxiety model. The anxiolytic effect of YYO (0.1%, 1% and 10%, v/v) was evaluated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test after odor exposure. Western blot was used to detect the phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and the expression of c-Fos in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus after the EPM test. Serotonin and its metabolite change in the brain were detected by liquid chromatogram with an electrochemical detector. The effect of YYO on the plasma corticosterone level was evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after the odor exposure. RESULTS: The behavior analysis showed that m-CPP (2â€¯mg/kg and 4â€¯mg/kg) could induce anxiety behaviors in the mice while diazepam (2â€¯mg/kg) reversed the anxiety behavior induced by m-CPP. YYO dose-dependently increased the time and number of entries in the open arms (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) compared to the Tween 80 group. YYO reduced the phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) in both PFC and hippocampus. Down-regulations of phosphor-CREB (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) and c-Fos (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05) were only observed in the hippocampus. YYO also affected the brain serotonin metabolism and reduced the blood plasma corticosterone level of the m-CPP treated mice. CONCLUSION: YYO odor exposure could reverse the anxiety behaviors generated by m-CPP.

One feature of the augmentation is a shift in the type of perseverative behaviors to those generally associated with higher acute doses of the drug. Consistent with these observations, rats pretreated with six daily injections of amphetamine (3 mg/kg) exhibited primarily oral stereotypies to a challenge dose of 2.5 mg/kg of amphetamine, whereas control animals exhibited focused sniffing and repetitive head movements. Previously we found that the acute administration of amphetamine or methylphenidate only at doses which induce oral stereotypies promotes a rapid desensitization of striatal dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase. We therefore examined the effects of repeated amphetamine pretreatment on this index of D1 dopamine receptors. The administration of 2.5 mg/kg of amphetamine produced a 2-fold shift to the right in the concentration-response curve for dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in animals pretreated with amphetamine, but not in saline pretreated controls. No effect of the chronic amphetamine pretreatment on dopamine stimulated cyclase in the absence of amphetamine challenge was observed.

Impairments in neurotransmission are reported in multiple brain regions in the weeks following experimental TBI and may contribute to behavioral dysfunction. Formation of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex is an important mechanism for neurotransmitter exocytosis. We previously showed that lithium treatment attenuated hippocampal decreases in Î±-synuclein and VAMP2, enhanced SNARE complex formation, and improved cognitive performance after TBI. However, the effect of TBI on striatal SNARE complex formation is not known. We hypothesized lithium treatment would attenuate TBI-induced impairments in evoked dopamine release and increase the abundance of synaptic proteins associated with dopamine neurotransmission. The current study evaluated the effect of lithium (1â€‰mmol/kg/day) administration on striatal evoked dopamine neurotransmission, SNARE complex formation, and proposed actions of lithium, including inhibition of GSK3Î², assessment of synaptic marker protein abundance, and synaptic proteins important for dopamine synthesis and transport following controlled cortical impact (CCI).

Despite evidence that risk for these disorders derives from heritable variation in DA-linked genes, a better understanding is needed of the molecular and circuit context through which gene variation drives distinct disease traits. Previously, we identified the DA transporter (DAT) variant Val559 in subjects with ADHD and established that the mutation supports anomalous DAT-mediated DA efflux (ADE). Here, we demonstrate that region-specific contributions of D(2) autoreceptors (D2AR) to presynaptic DA homeostasis dictate the consequences of Val559 expression in adolescent male mice. We show that activation of D2ARs in the WT dorsal striatum (DS), but not ventral striatum (VS), increases DAT phosphorylation and surface trafficking. In contrast, the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is D2AR-dependent in both regions. In the DS but not VS of Val559 mice, tonic activation of D2ARs drives a positive feedback loop that promotes surface expression of efflux-prone DATs, raising extracellular DA levels and overwhelming DAT-mediated DA clearance capacity. Whereas D2ARs that regulate DAT are tonically activated in the Val559 DS, D2ARs that regulate TH become desensitized, allowing maintenance of cytosolic DA needed to sustain ADE. Together with prior findings, our results argue for distinct D2AR pools that regulate DA synthesis versus DA release and inactivation and offer a clear example of how the penetrance of gene variation can be limited to a subset of expression sites based on differences in intersecting regulatory networks.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Altered dopamine (DA) signaling has been linked to multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. In an effort to understand and model disease-associated DAergic disturbances, we previously screened the DA transporter (DAT) in subjects with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and identified multiple, functionally impactful, coding variants. One of these variants, Val559, supports anomalous DA efflux (ADE) and in transgenic mice leads to changes in locomotor patterns, psychostimulant sensitivity, and impulsivity. Here, we show that the penetrance of Val559 ADE is dictated by region-specific differences in how presynaptic D(2)-type autoreceptors (D2ARs) constrain DA signaling, biasing phenotypic effects to dorsal striatal projections. The Val559 model illustrates how the impact of genetic variation underlying neuropsychiatric disorders can be shaped by the differential engagement of synaptic regulatory mechanisms.",,United States,2018,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0055-18.2018,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",dopamine and dopamine D2 autoreceptor and dopamine transporter and neuropsychiatric disorders,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29739866

Antinociceptive effects of PLZ were identified in the formalin model of tonic pain (Mifflin et al., 2016) and in allodynia associated with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, (EAE) a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (Potter et al., 2016). Here, we further clarify the specific types of stimuli and contexts in which PLZ modulates nociceptive sensitivity. Our findings indicate that PLZ selectively inhibits ongoing inflammatory pain while sparing transient reflexive and acute nociception. We also investigated the cellular mechanisms of action of PLZ in the dorsal horn, and as expected of a monoamine-oxidase inhibitor, PLZ increased serotonin (5HT) immunoreactivity. We next used two approaches to test the hypothesis that PLZ inhibits the activation of spinal nociresponsive neurons. First, we evaluated the formalin-evoked protein expression of the immediate early gene, c-fos. PLZ reduced Fos expression in the superficial dorsal horn. Second, we evaluated the effects of PLZ on intracellular calcium responses to superfusion of glutamate (0.3-1.0â€¯mM) in an ex vivo lumbar spinal cord slice preparation. Superfusion with PLZ (100-300â€¯Î¼M) reduced 1â€¯mM glutamate-evoked calcium responses. This was blocked by pretreatment with the 5HT1A-receptor antagonist WAY-100,635, but not the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan.

The frontal cortex serotonin receptors are thought to contribute to psychosis-like behaviors. This study investigated changes in serotonergic markers in the frontal cortex following methamphetamine self-administration and hallucinogenic drug-induced behavior. METHODS: Consistent with previously published studies, freely cycling male and female rats were allowed to self-administer methamphetamine (males: 0.12 mg/infusion; females: 0.09 mg/infusion) or saline (10 ÂµL) for 7 days. On the day following self-administration or following 10 days of extinction training, animals were given the serotonin 2A/2C agonist, 1-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (2 mg/kg, i.p.), and head twitches were analyzed. Autoradiography was also used to assess serotonin receptors and transporters in the frontal cortex following self-administration. RESULTS: Methamphetamine self-administration led to an increase in DOI-induced head-twitch behavior compared to saline only on the day following self-administration. Increases in serotonin receptors in the orbitofrontal cortex and decreases in serotonin transporters in the orbitofrontal cortex and infralimbic cortex were observed following methamphetamine self-administration as assessed by autoradiography.

Flunitrazepam, a potent hypnotic, was used alone or combined with parachlorophenylalanine (pCPA), an inhibitor of the synthesis of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of the reuptake of 5-HT. Flunitrazepam increased the amount of orthodox sleep, the latency of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decreased the amount of REM sleep. The drug pCPA decreased the total sleep time and the amount of orthodox and REM sleep. Administration of flunitrazepam to pCPA-pretreated rats induced orthodox sleep in an identical way to that found in the controls. The drug 8-OH-DPAT increased wakefulness and the latency of REM sleep. The association of flunitrazepam with 8-OH-DPAT abolished the increase in waking seen after 8-OH-DPAT alone. In contrast, the combined treatment with flunitrazepam and 8-OH-DPAT resulted in a lengthening of the latency of REM sleep significantly greater than that observed with the same dose of each drug alone. Fluvoxamine increased the latency a decrease the amount of REM sleep. The association of fluvoxamine with flunitrazepam induced a decrease in REM sleep, equal to the sum of the effects of the two drugs alone. Fluvoxamine did not modify the other effects of flunitrazepam. The present experiments demonstrate that the association of pCPA, 8-OH-DPAT and fluvoxamine, did not alter the hypnogenic effect of flunitrazepam. The possibility of an involvement of 5-HT mechanisms in the effect of flunitrazepam on the phasic events in sleep is questionable.",,England,1988,10.1016/0028-3908(88)90024-x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2977426

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) can modulate dopamine neurotransmission to reduce rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. A recent study from our laboratory shows that rewarding effects of morphine are inhibited in rats co-treated with buspirone. To understand the neurochemical mechanism involved in morphine addiction and its inhibition with buspirone, present study determines the effects of buspirone, morphine and their co-administration on the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine in the NAc and CN. We find that rewarding effects of morphine are associated with an enhancement and attenuation of dopamine metabolism, respectively in the CN and NAc. Serotonin metabolism is enhanced in both regions. Co-administration of buspirone not only prevents rewarding effects of morphine, but its effects on the metabolism of dopamine and serotonin in the NAc and CN are also reversed. Results suggest that 5-HT1A receptor dependent modulation of dopamine neurotransmission in the CN and NAc is involved in the modulation of the rewarding effects of morphine in buspirone co-treated animals.

Perturbations of DA signaling in humans are associated with multiple neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders, including Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction and schizophrenia. In the nematode C. elegans, DA signaling regulates mating behavior, learning, food seeking and locomotion. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of function mutations in the dat-1 gene that encodes the presynaptic DA transporter (DAT-1) results in a rapid cessation of movement when animals are placed in water, termed Swimming Induced Paralysis (Swip). Loss of function mutations in genes that support DA biosynthesis, DA vesicular packaging and DA action at the extrasynaptic D2-type DA receptor DOP-3 suppress Swip in dat-1 animals, consistent with paralysis as arising from excessive DA signaling. Although animals grown on the vesicular monoamine transporter antagonist reserpine diminish Swip, the drug must be applied chronically, can impact the signaling of multiple biogenic amines, and has been reported to have penetrant, off-target actions. Here, we demonstrate that the antipsychotic drug azaperone potently and rapidly suppresses Swip behavior in either dat-1 mutants, as well as in wildtype animals treated with the DAT-1 antagonist nisoxetine, with genetic experiments consistent with DOP-3 antagonism as the mechanism of Swip suppression. Reversal of Swip in previously paralyzed dat-1 animals by azaperone application demonstrates an otherwise functionally-intact swimming circuit in these mutants. Finally, whereas azaperone suppresses DA-dependent Swip, the drug fails to attenuate the DA-independent paralysis induced by Î²PEA, aldicarb or genetic disruption of Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling. We discuss our findings with respect to the use of azaperone as a potent and selective tool in the identification and analysis of presynaptic mechanisms that regulate DA signaling.",,England,2019,10.1016/j.neuint.2018.05.013,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Azaperone and C. elegans and D2-type dopamine receptor and Dopamine and Swip,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-29800604

A large body of evidence indicates a functional crosstalk between both receptors in the brain, but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely elucidated. Here, we have explored the influence of 5-HT(2A) receptor upon the phosphorylation pattern of mGlu(2) receptor in light of the importance of specific phosphorylation events in regulating G protein-coupled receptor signaling and physiological outcomes. Among the five mGlu(2) receptor-phosphorylated residues identified in HEK-293 cells, the phosphorylation of Ser(843) was enhanced upon mGlu(2) receptor stimulation by the orthosteric agonist LY379268 only in cells co-expressing the 5-HT(2A) receptor. Likewise, administration of LY379268 increased mGlu(2) receptor phosphorylation at Ser(843) in prefrontal cortex of wild-type mice but not 5-HT(2A)(-/-) mice. Exposure of HEK-293 cells co-expressing mGlu(2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors to 5-HT also increased Ser(843) phosphorylation state to a magnitude similar to that measured in LY379268-treated cells. In both HEK-293 cells and prefrontal cortex, Ser(843) phosphorylation elicited by 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation was prevented by the mGlu(2) receptor antagonist LY341495, while the LY379268-induced effect was abolished by the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907. Mutation of Ser(843) into alanine strongly reduced G(i/o) signaling elicited by mGlu(2) or 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation in cells co-expressing both receptors.

Supplementum,,"Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs, stereotyped or dyskinetic movements) were induced with different dopamine mimetics in rat, cat, and monkey. In the rat only stereotyped movements were observed, whereas in the cat dopamine agonists (apomorphine) preferentially induced dyskinesia but dopamine/noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (d-amphetamine, nomifensine) induced predominantly stereotypes; L-dopa induced an equal, low, number of both kinds of movements in the cat. In the monkey with bilateral lesions of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathways the AIMs could be divided into type 1 dyskinesia (behavioral), type 2 dyskinesia (oral and psychomotor), and chorea. GABA agonists (progabide, muscimol) had a biphasic action on apomorphine stereotypes in the rat, slightly (10%-20%) augmenting these movements at low doses and antagonizing (greater than 50%) them at higher doses. As these latter doses of progabide also antagonize apomorphine-induced circling in rats with a unilateral lesion of the substantia nigra, it is likely that this action is exerted at or beyond the dopamine target cell. In cats the dyskinetic movements induced by apomorphine were abolished by progabide. In contrast, L-dopa-induced stereotypies were resistant to the antidyskinetic action of progabide, and at low doses of L-dopa an increased incidence of stereotypies was noted. In the monkey, the type 1 dyskinesia following L-dopa and piribedil were also relatively resistant to progabide administration, whereas the type 2 dyskinesia and chorea were abolished by progabide. These studies are parallel to and support the clinical observations that dyskinetic movements following a direct action at the dopamine receptor (tardive dyskinesia) may be reversed by progabide whereas those associated with dopamine neuron activity, perhaps together with noradrenergic activation (L-dopa dyskinesia), are resistant to the antidyskinetic action of progabide.",,Germany,1985,10.1007/978-3-642-70140-5_25,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-2987905

We recently reported that the regionally-selective blockade of the glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) by dihydrokainic acid (DHK) microinfusion in rat infralimbic cortex (IL), the most ventral part of the mPFC, evoked immediate (10â€¯min) antidepressant-like responses, which involved AMPA-R activation and were associated to increased serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) release. Given the reciprocal connectivity between the mPFC and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), here we examined the serotoninergic mechanisms involved in the reported antidepressant-like responses of DHK microinfusion. First, we show that antidepressant-like responses evoked by IL application of DHK and citalopram are mediated by local 5-HT(1A) receptors (5-HT(1A)-R), since they are cancelled by previous IL WAY100635 microinfusion. Second, IL DHK microinfusion increases excitatory inputs onto DR, as shown by an increased glutamate and 5-HT release in DR and by a selective increase of c-Fos expression in DR 5-HT neurons, not occurring in putative GABAergic neurons. This view is also supported by an increased 5-HT release in ventral hippocampus following IL DHK microinfusion. Interestingly, antidepressant-like responses evoked by IL DHK lasted for 2â€¯h and could be prolonged for up to 24â€¯h by attenuating self-inhibitory effects via 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. In contrast, the antidepressant-like effects of S-AMPA microinfusion in IL were short-lasting.

Neuronal serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine (DA) activities were examined in the medial preoptic hypothalamic area (MPOH), medial basal hypothalamic area (MBH), and median eminence (ME). Ether stress increased plasma PRL, ACTH, and beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (beta end) as well as NE metabolism in the MPOH and MBH and neuronal 5-HT activity in the MBH, and decreased neuronal DA activity in the ME of prepubertal animals. Ether stress elicited similar changes in infantile animals, with the important exceptions that plasma PRL, neuronal 5-HT activity in the MBH, and neuronal DA synthesis in the ME were not affected at this earlier age. Morphine increased plasma PRL, ACTH, and beta end levels, elevated neuronal NE and 5-HT activities in the MPOH and MBH, and decreased DA synthesis in the ME in both infantile and prepubertal animals. Naloxone administration did not alter basal hormone concentrations or neuronal monoamine activity in any brain area, but did prevent all of the morphine-induced changes as well as the ether stress-induced changes in PRL, MBH neuronal 5-HT activity, and DA synthesis in the ME of prepubertal animals. In addition, naloxone augmented the ether stress-induced increases in ACTH and beta end in prepubertal rats. Indirect stimulation of 5-HT neurons by administration of the amino acid precursor of 5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptophan, resulted in decreased DA synthesis in the ME of infantile animals and increased plasma PRL levels in that age group, indicating that this portion of the neurochemical connection is already present in infantile animals. Furthermore, the 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced increase in PRL was blocked by pretreatment with naloxone. The results demonstrate that both the ether stress- and morphine-induced increases in plasma PRL, but not in ACTH or beta end, are associated with increased neuronal 5-HT activity in the MBH and a decreased neuronal DA activity in the ME, that these are opiate receptor-mediated effects, and that infantile rats apparently lack a functional opiate-5-HT connection, which matures some time between days 13 and 36 postnatally.",,United States,1986,10.1210/endo-118-2-797,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3002767

In contrast, modafinil enhances cognition by increasing PFC function. Accumulated evidence indicates that psychostimulant drugs, including modafinil and METH, regulate gene expression via epigenetic modifications. In this study, we measured the effects of single-dose injections of modafinil and METH on the protein levels of acetylated histone H3 (H3ac) and H4ac, deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, and of the NMDA subunit GluN1 in the medial PFC (mPFC) of mice euthanized 1â€¯h after drug administration. To test if dopamine (DA) receptors (DRs) participate in the biochemical effects of the two drugs, we injected the D1Rs antagonist, SCH23390, or the D2Rs antagonist, raclopride, 30â€¯min before administration of METH and modafinil. We evaluated each drug effect on glutamate synaptic transmission in D1R-expressing layer V pyramidal neurons. We also measured the enrichment of H3ac and H4ac at the promoters of several genes including DA, NE, orexin, histamine, and glutamate receptors, and their mRNA expression, since they are responsive to chronic modafinil and METH treatment. Acute modafinil and METH injections caused similar effects on total histone acetylation, increasing H3ac and decreasing H4ac, and they also increased HDAC1, HDAC2 and GluN1 protein levels in the mouse mPFC. In addition, the effects of the drugs were prevented by pre-treatment with D1Rs and D2Rs antagonists. Specifically, the changes in H4ac, HDAC2, and GluN1 were responsive to SCH23390, whereas those of H3ac and GluN1 were responsive to raclopride. Whole-cell patch clamp in transgenic BAC-Drd1a-tdTomato mice showed that METH, but not modafinil, induced paired-pulse facilitation of EPSCs, suggesting reduced presynaptic probability of glutamate release onto layer V pyramidal neurons. Analysis of histone 3/4 enrichment at specific promoters revealed: i) distinct effects of the drugs on histone 3 acetylation, with modafinil increasing H3ac at Drd1 and Adra1b promoters, but METH increasing H3ac at Adra1a; ii) distinct effects on histone 4 acetylation enrichment, with modafinil increasing H4ac at the Drd2 promoter and decreasing it at Hrh1, but METH increasing H4ac at Drd1; iii) comparable effects of both psychostimulants, increasing H3ac at Drd2, Hcrtr1, and Hrh1 promoters, decreasing H3ac at Hrh3, increasing H4ac at Hcrtr1, and decreasing H4ac at Hcrtr2, Hrh3, and Grin1 promoters. Interestingly, only METH altered mRNA levels of genes with altered histone acetylation status, inducing increased expression of Drd1a, Adra1a, Hcrtr1, and Hrh1, and decreasing Grin1. Our study suggests that although acute METH and modafinil can both increase DA neurotransmission in the mPFC, there are similar and contrasting epigenetic and transcriptional consequences that may account for their divergent clinical effects.",,England,2019,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.07.019,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",Dopamine receptors and Glutamate and Histone acetylation and Methamphetamine and Modafinil and Prefrontal cortex,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30056065

RESULTS: The present study found acute lurasidone reversed the cognitive deficit in novel object recognition (NOR) in subchronic (sc) phencyclidine (PCP)-treated mice, an animal model for CIAS. This effect of lurasidone was blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A)R antagonist, WAY-100635, or the 5-HT(7)R agonist, AS 19. Lurasidone significantly increased medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) ACh, DA, and Glu efflux, all of which were blocked by WAY-100635, with similar effects in the dorsal striatum (dSTR), except for the absence of an effect on Glu increase. AS 19 inhibited Glu, but not DA efflux, in the dSTR. The selective 5-HT(7)R antagonist, SB-26970, increased mPFC DA, 5-HT, Glu, and, importantly, also GABA efflux and striatal DA, NE, 5-HT, and Glu efflux, indicating tonic inhibition of the release of these neurotransmitters by 5-HT(7)R stimulation. These results provide new evidence that GABA release in the mPFC is tonically inhibited by 5-HT(7)R stimulation and suggest that a selective 5-HT(7)R antagonist might be clinically useful to enhance cortical GABAergic release. All SB-269970 effects were blocked by AS 19 or WAY-100635, suggesting 5-HT(1A)R agonism is necessary for the release of these neurotransmitters by SB-269970. Lurasidone increased ACh, DA, and NE but not Glu efflux in mPFC and dSTR DA and Glu efflux in 5-HT(7) KO mice. CONCLUSION: We conclude that lurasidone-induced Glu efflux in mPFC requires 5-HT(7)R antagonism while its effects on cortical ACh and DA efflux are mainly due to 5-HT(1A)R stimulation.",,Germany,2018,10.1007/s00213-018-4972-y,Journal Article,Cognition and Lurasidone and SB-269970 and Schizophrenia and WAY-100635,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30066135

A program to identify and test new drugs to decrease ethanol intake has focused on drugs that enhance central serotonergic neurotransmission and consistently attenuate ethanol consumption. Animal studies have shown consistent findings with direct and indirect serotonin (5-HT) agonists. Ethanol intake decreased after the administration of 5-HT precursors, 5-HT uptake inhibitors, intracerebral 5-HT, and postsynaptic 5-HT agonists; in contrast, destruction of serotonin-containing neurons with 5,6- or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine increased ethanol intake. Administration of zimelidine (200 mg/day p.o.) to 16 healthy alcohol abusers was associated with a significant increase in number of abstinent days and a decrease in number of drinks consumed. Approximately 50% of the subjects were responders, 35% were partial responders, and 10%-15% were nonresponders. In a recent double-blind crossover study, citalopram, an even more selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, produced similar results. Because serotonin uptake inhibitors acted rapidly and subjects were not clinically depressed, this action is distinct from antidepressant effects. These drugs most likely interfere with the neurobiologic mechanisms regulating ethanol intake and provide an innovative approach for modulating the use of alcohol in problem drinkers.",,United States,1986,,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3007443

This developmental disorder has been related to dysfunctions in the brains' rewards circuitry, which, in turn, has been linked to dysfunctions in dopaminergic (DA) signaling. The present study investigated if FLX affects processes involved in dopaminergic neuronal differentiation. Mouse neuronal precursors were differentiated into midbrain dopaminergic precursor cells (mDPCs) and concomitantly exposed to clinically relevant doses of FLX. Subsequently, dopaminergic precursors were evaluated for expression of differentiation and stemness markers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. FLX treatment led to increases in early regional specification markers orthodenticle homeobox 2 (Otx2) and homeobox engrailed-1 and -2 (En1 and En2). On the other hand, two transcription factors essential for midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurogenesis, LIM homeobox transcription factor 1 Î± (Lmx1a) and paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (Pitx3) were downregulated by FLX treatment. The stemness marker nestin (Nes) was increased, whereas the neuronal differentiation marker Î²3-tubulin (Tubb3) decreased. Additionally, we observed that FLX modulates the expression of several genes associated with autism spectrum disorder and downregulates the estrogen receptors (ERs) Î± and Î² Further investigations using ERÎ² knockout (BERKO) mDPCs showed that FLX had no or even opposite effects on several of the genes analyzed. These findings suggest that FLX affects differentiation of the dopaminergic system by increasing production of dopaminergic precursors, yet decreasing their maturation, partly via interference with the estrogen system.",,United States,2018,10.1124/mol.118.112342,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30115672

Modafinil is an awakening agent approved for narcolepsy. In addition to its clinical uses some reports revealed that modafinil was associated with some alterations in seizure threshold. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of acute administration of modafinil in clonic seizure threshold (CST) induced by pentylenetetrazole in mice and the involvement of glutamate, nitric oxide, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), and serotonin systems in this feature. Modafinil at 80 and 150Â mg/kg showed anti- and pro-convulsant effects respectively and expressed maximum anti- and pro-convulsant activities at 30Â min after injection. Both modulatory effects were blunted by pretreatment of L-NAME [nonspecific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor; 10Â mg/kg, i.p.], 7-nitroindazole (a neuronal NOS inhibitor; 40Â mg/kg, i.p.), and aminoguanidine (an inducible NOS inhibitor; 50Â mg/kg, i.p.). Injection of the NOS precursor L-arginine (60Â mg/kg, i.p.) before modafinil did not change the anti-convulsant effect, while thoroughly reversed the pro-convulsant one.

Finally, pretreatment of citalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; 0.1Â mg/kg, i.p.) did not modify the convulsant activities of modafinil. Therefore, nitric oxide system may mediate anti-convulsant activity, while glutamate, nitric oxide, and GABA pathways may involve in pro-convulsant property.

In the presence of carbamylcholine, we found that C6SLMel competitively inhibits [3H]phencyclidine binding with high affinity (KD = 8.7 X 10(-7) M for C6SLMel), whereas in the presence of alpha-toxin or in the absence of agonist, C6SLMel binds with lower affinity (KD = 2 X 10(-5) M). At concentrations lower than 1 X 10(-5) M, C6SLMel does not bind to the agonist site but enhances [3H]acetylcholine binding. These findings show that C6SLMel binds to the allosterically coupled noncompetitive inhibitor site which is regulated by agonist binding. In addition, C6SLMel preferentially associates with the desensitized receptor state known to exhibit high affinities for agonists and local anesthetics. ESR measurements of C6SLMel bound to receptor membranes in the absence of agonist show moderately immobilized spectra. Addition of carbamylcholine results in the appearance of a strongly immobilized component. Prior exposure to alpha-toxin blocks the carbamylcholine-induced, strongly immobilized component in the ESR spectrum. Furthermore, in the presence of carbamylcholine, back-titration of bound C6SLMel with phencyclidine decreases the highly immobilized component at concentrations consistent with the KD for phencyclidine. These findings indicate that C6SLMel detects conformational changes between the resting and desensitized acetylcholine receptor states that occur at the noncompetitive inhibitor binding site.

The binding of [3H]serotonin to choroid plexus membranes was also unaffected by GppNHp while a dose-dependent decrease was observed in pig cortical and hippocampal membranes. The porcine choroid plexus contained a forskolin- and histamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase. Serotonin, however, was ineffective in this preparation. While forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the rat hippocampus was inhibited by serotonin forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the choroid plexus was insensitive to serotonin.

As a means to examine this conflict, we have utilized an in vitro superfusion system to study the effects of DA, norepinephrine (NE), phentolamine (alpha-antagonist), pimozide (DA antagonist), and two DA agonists (apomorphine and bromocryptine) on GnRH release from isolated mediobasal hypothalami from adult male rats. In this dynamic system, graded concentrations of both NE and DA (2.0 nM to 2.0 microM) led to a dose-dependent increase in GnRH output during the 10 min interval that followed each pulse dose of NE (P less than 0.02) or DA (P less than 0.05). The DA-induced GnRH release was reproducible, consistent, and significant over five successive pulses (20 microM) at 30-min intervals (P less than 0.02). Coinfusion of phentolamine (20 microM) prevented the DA (20 microM) induced release of GnRH (P less than 0.03), but pimozide (20 microM) had no significant effect on DA-induced GnRH release (P greater than 0.3). The two DA agonists, apomorphine and bromocryptine, at doses up to 2.0 microM and 200 nM, respectively, had no significant effect on GnRH release. To determine whether DA was causing a direct stimulation of alpha-adrenergic receptors or being enzymatically converted to NE which could then stimulate alpha-receptors to induce GnRH release, rats were injected with sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) (550 mg/kg BW) ip, 1 h before death. DDC blocks the enzymatic conversion of DA to NE, and this was reflected by a 37% decrease in hypothalamic NE efflux during the superfusion. However, pulses of DA, even in the presence of DDC, were associated with a marked dose-dependent increase in hypothalamic NE efflux, and DDC failed to prevent the subsequent stimulation of GnRH release. We conclude that the apparent DA-induced release of GnRH is most probably attributable to DA-induced release of hypothalamic NE which, in turn, acts through alpha-adrenergic receptors on peptidergic neurons to stimulate GnRH release.",,United States,1986,10.1210/endo-119-4-1726,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3019641

While the neuromodulatory actions of NE have been well characterized, the response and involvement of cortical astrocytes to physiological noradrenergic systems remain largely unknown, especially at the molecular level. In this study, we biochemically characterize the action of NE on astrocytes of the murine neocortex. NE stimulation of acute brain slices rapidly increase phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43) at Serine (Ser) 368, in slices from both juvenile and adolescent animals. The phosphorylation is mediated by the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway under the Î±1-adrenergic receptor and remains elevated for tens of minutes following brief exposure to NE, well after the intracellular calcium level returns to normal level, suggesting the plastic nature of this phosphorylation event. Importantly, this phosphorylation event persists in the absence of neuronal transmissions, suggesting that the effect of NE on Cx43 phosphorylation is induced directly on astrocytes. Furthermore, these NE-induced phosphorylations are associated with biochemical dissociation of Cx43 from gap-junctional plaques to non-junctional compartments. Finally, we show that pharmacological manipulation of the noradrenergic system using psychoactive drugs modulates phosphorylation of Cx43 in the cerebral cortex inÂ vivo. These data suggest that NE acts directly on astrocytes in parallel with neurons and modulates functionally critical connexin channel proteins in a plastic manner. Thus, plasticity of astrocytes induced by the ""gliomodulatory"" actions of NE may play important roles in their physiological as well as pharmacological actions in the brain.",,United States,2018,10.1016/j.bbrc.2018.09.021,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Astrocyte and Connexin and Gap junction and Norepinephrine and Phosphorylation,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30213630

Stress conditions can cause dopaminergic dysfunction, reduce motivational processes and induce compensatory drug use. The susceptibility to stress is characterized by individual variability. Psychostimulants such as cocaine, amphetamine and its derivatives act as positive reinforcers, affecting mood changes. Prolonged use of psychoactive substances can cause persistent plastic changes in the limbic system (disruption of neurogenesis, neurons atrophy), resulting in addictions or other forms of psychopathology like mood disorders. One of the reason is dysregulation of the dopaminergic system and dysfunction of local dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Stress factors also inhibit neuronal plasticity. In turn, antidepressants may increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and TrkB receptors expression and improve neuronal proliferation, restoring proper functioning of the limbic regions. An important manifestation of the distinct functioning of the dopaminergic mesolimbic system is the difference between the sexes and the aging process. Epidemiological studies indicate that depression, anxiety disorders, and other emotional disorders often accompany drug abuse. The search for neurobiological basis of affective disorders and identification of factors, including epigenetic ones (interdependence of genetic and environmental factors), associated with different susceptibility to stress and predisposition to addiction to psychoactive substances is currently being carried out by many researches.

It is an endogenous agonist of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) that acts as a neuromodulator of classic neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. At high concentrations, Î²-PEA contracts smooth muscle, and a role for TAARs in these responses has been postulated. The high dietary intake of trace amines has been associated with such symptoms as hypertension and migraine, especially after the intake of foods containing such compounds. In gastrointestinal tissues, TAAR expression was reported, although the effect of Î²-PEA on gastric contractile behaviour is unknown. Here, isolated strips that were obtained from the rat gastric fundus were stimulated with high micromolar concentrations of Î²-PEA. Under resting tonus, Î²-PEA induced contractions. In contrast, when the strips were previously contracted with KCl, a relaxant response to Î²-PEA was observed. The contractile effect of Î²-PEA was inhibited by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor antagonists (i.e., cyproheptadine and ketanserin) but not by the TAAR(1) antagonist EPPTB. In gastric fundus strips that were previously contracted with 80Â mmol/L KCl, the relaxant effect of Î²-PEA intensified in the presence of 5-HT receptor antagonists, which was inhibited by EPPTB and the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330A. The guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ did not alter the relaxant effects of Î²-PEA. In conclusion, Î²-PEA exerted dual contractile and relaxant effects on rat gastric fundus.

fafcd397-70ed-43ae-b254-a690de4492c4,Serotonin-norepinephrine receptor interactions in the brain: implications for the pharmacology and pathophysiology of affective disorders.,Sulser F ,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,,"When chronically administered, most clinically effective antidepressant treatments (pharmacotherapy and ECT) reduce the sensitivity of the norepinephrine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in brain which, in turn, is associated with a down-regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor subpopulation. Because this norepinephrine receptor system is linked to an amplifier system, small changes in the number of receptors or in the accumulation of the second messenger cyclic AMP will be amplified. Results of the studies discussed in this paper demonstrate that an intact serotonergic neuronal input is required for the proper functioning of beta-adrenoceptors and for the down-regulation of the density of these receptors by antidepressant treatments. Under conditions of impaired serotonergic activity, beta-adrenoceptors display profound decreases in agonist but not in antagonist affinity. The changes are reminiscent of ""uncoupled"" receptors. While beta-adrenoceptors are coupled in a stimulatory fashion to adenylate cyclase, resulting in the formation of the second messenger cyclic AMP, serotonin (5-HT) receptors are linked to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (5-HT2 receptors in cortex, 5-HT1C receptors in choroid plexus) generating two second messengers, diacylglycerol and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate. The final common pathway of aminergic receptor activation seems to be protein-kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation leading to changes in cellular activity. Evidence is presented suggesting that the delayed down-regulation of the linked 5-HT/norepinephrine beta-adrenoceptor system by antidepressant treatment reflects a therapeutically relevant biochemical action and prompts the generation of the ""5-HT/norepinephrine link hypothesis"" of affective disorders.",,United States,1987,,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3029044

Many investigators believe that norepinephrine (NE) receptor down-regulation is more important than serotonin (5-HT) receptor down-regulation. The ability to accurately determine which receptor types or subtypes have been down-regulated has been impaired by the lack of sufficiently specific ligands for labeling these receptor subtypes. Studies that have attempted to examine 5-HT2 receptor down-regulation have used [3H]-ketanserin as the ligand of choice to label 5-HT2 receptors, but this ligand also labels a nondescript site. The binding of [3H]-ketanserin to sites other than 5-HT2 receptors can be examined and controlled for by autoradiographic techniques. The authors briefly review potential problems involved in analyzing receptor binding after antidepressant treatment and present new findings of receptor alterations in rat brain as examined by autoradiographic techniques following chronic exposure to fluoxetine (a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor that has been shown to be an effective antidepressant). Laboratory animals injected with fluoxetine showed receptor down-regulation (reduced density) in the serotonergic system. A provocative and potentially important finding of this study is that this selective 5-HT uptake blocker also down-regulates beta-adrenergic receptors in the CNS.",,United States,1987,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3029045

The measurement of the inhibition of PGE1-induced cyclic AMP accumulation in the whole platelet indicated that the biological event immediately associated with alpha 2-adrenergic stimulation was not modified. The aggregatory response to ADP or ADP plus adrenaline was totally abolished in clomipramine-treated platelets.

The evidence indicates that, if the stimulus persists or recurs within 24 hours, the indole-2, 3-dioxygenase enzyme (IDO) of the kynurenine metabolic pathway, which increases the synthesis of quinolinic acid, is activated with an associated reduction of serotonin synthesis. Quinolinic acid activates NMDA receptors in the central nervous system and stimulates the secretion of interleukins IL-6 and 1L-1Î², among others, promoting hyper-activity of the HPA axis and reinforcing a bias of the tryptophan metabolism to produce quinolinic acid, and interleukins by the innate immune system, further reducing the synthesis of serotonin and consolidating the depressive process.

Nevertheless, few studies were performed attempting to investigate the caffeine addiction. The present review was mainly aimed to answer the following question: is caffeine an abuse drug? To adress this point, the effects of caffeine in preclinical and clinical studies were summarized and critically analyzed taking account the abuse disorders described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). We concluded that the diagnostic criteria evidenced on DSM-V to intoxication-continued use and abstinence are not well supported by clinical studies. The fact that diagnostic criteria is not widely supported by preclinical or clinical studies may be due specially to a controversy in its exactly mechanism of action: recent literature point to an indirect, rather than direct modulation of dopamine receptors, and auto-limitant consumption due to adverse sensations in high doses. On the other hand, it reports clear withdrawal-related symptoms. Thus, based on a classical action on reward system, caffeine only partially fits its mechanism of action as an abuse drug, especially because previous research does not report a clear effect of dopaminergic activity enhance on nucleus accumbens; despite this, there are reports concerning dopaminergic modulation by caffeine on the striatum.

McN-5707 blocked tetrabenazine-induced sedation and ptosis in mice and rats, and potently inhibited the uptake of norepinephrine by synaptosomes from rat hypothalamus (Ki approximately 2 nM), and the uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex (Ki approximately 10 nM). McN-5707 also inhibited the uptake of dopamine by synaptosomes from rat striatum (Ki approximately 40 nM); however, the stereotypic behavior often caused by dopamine uptake inhibitors was not evident in rats at doses of 300 mg/kg (p.o.) or less. In receptor binding assays, McN-5707 potently inhibited ketanserin binding to serotonin 5-HT2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex (apparent Ki approximately 8 nM). In mice, McN-5707 antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitches. Spiperone binding to dopamine D2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat striatum was weakly inhibited by McN-5707 (apparent Ki approximately 400 nM), as was the binding of WB4101 to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (apparent Ki approximately 150 nM). McN-5707 was essentially inactive as an inhibitor of [3H]clonidine binding to alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors.

Thus, we have identified some of the most potent antagonists of TBZ-induced ptosis and some of the most potent inhibitors of the uptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin (in rat brain synaptosomes) ever reported. Compounds of particular note, in this regard, are 52b, 29b, 22b, and 48b, respectively. Biological activity was chiefly manifested by the trans isomeric class. Also, through resolution of four compounds, 7b, 24b, 37b, and 48b, biological activity was found to be associated with the (+) enantiomer subgroup (salts measured at 589 nm in MeOH), corresponding to the 6S, 10bR absolute configuration for 7b, 37b, and 48b, and the 6R,10bR configuration for 24b. An X-ray determination on (+)-24b X HBr established its absolute configuration; configurations for the other compounds were verified by enantiospecific synthesis starting with (+)-(R)-2-phenylpyrrolidine. Regarding the pendant phenyl ring, diverse substitution patterns were investigated. Those substitutions that were particularly unfavorable were 3',4',5'-trimethoxy (20b), 2',3',4',5',6'-pentafluoro (34b), 2'-trifluoromethyl (38b), 3',5'-bis(trifluoromethyl) (42b), 4'-n-butyl (44b), 2'-cyano (47b), 4'-methylsulfonyl (50b), and 2'-carboxy (58b). Exceedingly potent compounds, in one way or another, were 10b-12b, 22b, 23b, 25b, 28b, 29b, 33b, 45b, 48b, 51b-53b. The pattern of aromatic substitution had a strong impact on selectivity in the uptake tests (NE vs. DA vs. 5-HT). Activity was significantly diminished by methyl substitution of 7b at the 5 (65, 66), 6 (61b), or 10b (60b) position, by changing the phenyl group of 7b to cyclohexyl (67b), benzyl (68b), or H (72), by moving the phenyl group of 7b to the 5 (69) or 10b (70) position, by expansion of ring B to an azepine (78b), and by modification of ring C to an azetidine (77b), piperidine (75b), or azepine (74b). The interaction of selected analogues with various CNS receptors is reported. Little affinity was shown for the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, suggesting a lack of anticholinergic side effects. Interestingly, 24b and 33b displayed a high affinity for the serotonin-2 receptor, analogous to mianserin and clomipramine.

Quantitative analysis of imipramine competition curves confirmed the existence of two classes of [3H]imipramine sites: high-affinity with IC50 and 11.2 nM and low-affinity with IC50 of 630 nM for the competing ligand. The proportion of high- and low-affinity sites was 73 +/- 4 and 26 +/- 4%, respectively. Chronic treatment with all antidepressant drugs except iprindole significantly decreased the affinity but not the proportion of high-affinity sites for imipramine. IC50 of imipramine at low-affinity sites was even more markedly increased at low-affinity sites by all treatments except for phenelzine. Fluoxetine was by far the most effective in altering the affinity of both high- and low-affinity [3H]imipramine recognition sites. Both NE and 5-HT levels were significantly enhanced only by phenelzine treatment, whereas 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were found to be lower after fluoxetine. Kinetics of 5-HT uptake were altered significantly only in rats treated with fluoxetine: rate of 5-HT uptake (Vmax) was decreased by 43% and Km value increased from 104 to 184 nM. Changes in affinity of imipramine for its binding sites were not found to be associated with the effect of tested drugs on 5-HT levels or uptake. They may be due to adaptive alterations in physico-chemical properties of binding proteins although the presence of residual drug interfering with the binding assay cannot be excluded.

The pharmacological profile of inhibition by drugs of [3H]-imipramine and [3H]-paroxetine binding is highly correlated with the potency of the drugs to inhibit the uptake of 5HT. Denervation of serotonergic neurons by electrolytic lesions or with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine produces marked decreases in the density of [3H]-imipramine as well as [3H]-paroxetine binding. Dissociation kinetic experiments support the view that the substrate recognition site for 5HT is different from the modulatory site which is labelled by [3H]-imipramine or [3H]-paroxetine. The existence of an endogenous ligand acting on the [3H]-imipramine recognition site to modulate the 5HT transporter was proposed by several laboratories.

This narrative review aims to summarize the sex-related biological factors, which underpin anxiety, focusing on the interactions of sex and tryptophan/serotonin with anxiety. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases from inception until December 31, 2017. RESULTS: This review shows that sex may interact with many serotonin functions thereby modulating anxiety, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors, 5-HT transporter and central 5-HT concentrations and metabolism. Sex-steroids modulate the expression of serotonin transporter genes, creating a difference in serotonin availability. Sex and estrous cycle phases lead to varying anxiety responses to tryptophan depletion. Testosterone, progesterone and estrogen are important factors in mediating sex differences in serotonin responses to anxiety-generating behavioral tests. At prenatal levels, there are sexrelated differences in the reciprocal relationships between serotonin and the HPA-axis, which modulate anxiety-like behaviors. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways induce indoleamine-2,3-dioxynease (IDO) and the tryptophan catabolite (TRYCAT) pathway thereby increasing tryptophan degradation and increasing the production of TRYCATs including kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which may create an overall anxiogenic effect. The effects of immune activation on IDO are significantly more pronounced in women than men, and therefore, females may show increased levels of anxiogenic TRYCAT following immune challenge. Aberrations in the IDO-activated TRYCAT pathway are found in pregnant females and parturients and are associated with increased anxiety levels in the postnatal period. CONCLUSION: The results of this review underscore the necessity of studying the associations between serotonin and anxiety in both sexes taking into account the effects of immune activation on IDO and production of anxiogenic TRYCATs. Future anxiety research should focus on the interactions between serotonin/tryptophan and sex, sex hormones, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, the HPA axis and the immune system through the production of anxiogenic TRYCATs.",,United Arab Emirates,2018,10.2174/1568026618666181115093136,Journal Article and Review,5-HT and Anxiety disorders and Immune system and Inflammation and Sex and Tryptophan.,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30430940

Dopamine receptors are widely expressed in the body and function in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. Dopaminergic signaling pathways are crucial to the maintenance of physiological processes and an unbalanced activity may lead to dysfunctions that are related to neurodegenerative diseases.

BUP/SAM (ALKS 5461), a combination of buprenorphine (BUP) and samidorphan (SAM), is a novel opioid system modulator in development as an adjunct treatment for MDD. Using a rat strain (Wistar Kyoto rat) that is predisposed to stress and has an inadequate response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), we investigated the effect of BUP and SAM, individually and in combination, in established nonclinical assays used to study antidepressants (the forced swim test, FST) and anxiolytics (marble burying test). As opioids and their receptors are expressed in mesocorticolimbic regions of the brain, we analyzed extracellular concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and/or their metabolites in brain areas associated with mood and motivation. BUP alone and in combination with SAM significantly reduced immobility in the FST. Similarly, the BUP/SAM combination significantly reduced immobility in SSRI (escitalopram)-treated rats. BUP/SAM also decreased burying behavior. SAM attenuated BUP-induced changes of extracellular levels of serotonin and dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens shell. The latter suggests that the addition of SAM to BUP may limit activation of the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway and thereby reduce BUP's reinforcing properties.

Differences in potency in vitro and in vivo would appear to be due partly to the presence of active metabolites, formed in vivo, that show different selectivities for the serotonin transport site. Evidence suggests that the initial reduction in serotonin turnover after acute administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is followed by a return to control values after the drug has been administered for at least 2 weeks. These changes in amine turnover are associated with normalization of both the serotonergic and beta-adrenergic receptor systems. Evidence suggests that changes in neurotransmitter receptor numbers and function of blood cells (platelets and lymphocytes) in depressed patients are possible state markers of the illness and that antidepressant efficacy may not be directly associated with specificity of amine reuptake inhibition. Studies also show that the bilaterally bulbectomized rat exhibits deficits in platelet and synaptosomal serotonin transport that resemble those shown in depressed patients.

Considering the well-described sex differences in schizophrenia, we investigated whether sex affects MIA impact on dopamine system and on schizophrenia-related behavioral phenotype. Furthermore, considering peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î± (PPARÎ±) expression in the CNS as well as its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, we tested if PPARÎ± activation by prenatal treatment with a clinically available fibrate (fenofibrate) may mitigate MIA-related effects. METHODS: We induced MIA in rat dams with polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (Poly I:C) and assessed prepulse inhibition and dopamine neuron activity in the VTA by means of electrophysiological recordings in male and female preweaned and adult offspring. RESULTS: Poly I:C-treated males displayed prepulse inhibition deficits, reduced number and firing rate of VTA dopamine neurons, and paired-pulse facilitation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses. Prenatal fenofibrate administration attenuated detrimental effects induced by MIA on both the schizophrenia-like behavioral phenotype and dopamine transmission in male offspring.

In addition, cumulating evidences have linked alteration in 5-HT neurotransmission with the onset of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, such as depression, autisms and schizophrenia. Nevertheless only 5% of the total body content of serotonin exerts its action in the CNS, while the rest is synthetized and stored in peripheral tissues where it acts as an autacoid. In 2003 it became evident that two distinct isoforms of tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of serotonin, are selectively expressed in peripheral tissues and in the CNS, with Tph2 as the brain specific isoform. In the present review we describe how the discovery of Tph2 has improved our understanding on the role of serotonergic neurotransmission. We mainly focus on the analysis of animal models generated by genetic manipulation of Tph2, in which the synthesis of brain serotonin was either reduced or disrupted. The consequences of an altered serotonergic neurotransmission on brain development, as well as on physiological and behavioral processes will be assessed. Finally, we report on several association studies that have linked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human TPH2 gene with behavioral disturbances and neuropsychiatric disorders.",,France,2019,10.1016/j.biochi.2018.11.016,Journal Article and Review,Animal models and Behavior and Brain development and Neuropsychiatric disorders and Serotonin and Tph2 and Tryptophan hydroxylase 2,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30513372

The present study utilized cortical EEG and brain microdialysis in rats to compare the effects of MDPV (0.25, 1 and 2â€¯mg/kg, i.p.) with the hallucinogenic drugs MK-801 (0.05, 0.1 and 0.5â€¯mg/kg, i.p.) and ketamine (5, 15 and 25â€¯mg/kg, i.p.). Results revealed that MDPV similar to MK-801 and ketamine caused a dose-dependent increase in the cortical EEG synchronization. In addition, all three drugs produced an increase in DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex (FCx). However, there existed difference between the three drugs. In contrast to MDPV, MK-801 and ketamine had only moderate or little effects on DA efflux in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Except for ketamine, the effects of MDPV and MK-801 on EEG synchronization were blocked by the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH23990 (0.1â€¯mg/kg, i.p.) and D(2) receptor antagonist sulpiride (100â€¯mg/kg, i.p.). SCH23990 or sulpiride had no effect on ketamine-induced increases in EEG synchronization. In summary, the present comparative studies suggest that DA in the FCx, but unlikely the NAcc, exerts a critical role in increasing EEG synchronization associated with the excited delirium syndrome.

My overarching hypothesis is that these opposing effects are mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in different brain regions. My laboratory has shown that GR in the serotonergic dorsal raphÃ© nucleus (DRN) promote depression-like social and behavioral withdrawal in mice. We have also shown that GR in the DRN and noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) exhibit divergent regulation by antidepressants that have differential efficacy for depression subtypes with opposing abnormalities in glucocorticoids. The current study tested the hypothesis that LC GR would have effects opposite to those in the DRN by preventing rather than promoting social withdrawal. GR was deleted from LC NE neurons in female and male floxed GR mice by bilateral injections of lentivirus transducing Cre recombinase under control of a multimerized Phox 2a/2b response sequence (PRS) from the dopamine Î²-hydroxylase promoter (PRS-Cre). Female but not male PRS-Cre mice exhibited lower social interaction compared to controls injected with lentivirus transducing green fluorescent protein (PRS-GFP). Differences in social interaction between PRS-GFP and PRS-Cre females were not associated with differences in exploratory behavior, plasma corticosterone, male-female differences in LC GR expression, or changes in LC mineralocorticoid receptor or tyrosine hydroxylase gene expression. These results indicate that LC NE GR have sex-dependent effects to prevent social withdrawal, supporting the concept that glucocorticoids exert opposing effects on depression symptoms via different brain targets, and potentially revealing novel drug targets to treat depression, particularly in women.",,Netherlands,2019,10.1016/j.brainres.2018.12.026,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Depression and Glucocorticoid and Locus coeruleus and Norepinephrine and PRS promoter,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30576626

In mammals, it inhibits monoamine uptake through binding to the dopamine transporter, with a mechanism of action similar to cocaine, resulting in higher levels of dopamine at the synapse. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in a broad spectrum of processes such as locomotion, cognition, reward, and mental disorders. In this work we have studied, for the first time, the effects of TDF on behavior of both larval and adult zebrafish and its connection with changes in the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. We evaluated the acute exposure of 5 dpf larvae to different concentrations of TDF, ranging from 5â€¯mg/L to 35â€¯mg/L. The lowest concentration does not alter neither locomotor activity nor dopamine levels but produced changes in the expression of two genes, tyrosine hydroxylase 1 (th1) and dopamine transporter (dat). Besides, it induced a reduction in extracellular serotonin and had an anxiolytic-like effect, supported by a decrease in cortisol production. On the other hand, a high concentration of TDF produced a dose-dependent reduction in locomotion, which was reversed or enhanced by D1 (SCH-23390) or D2 (Haloperidol) dopamine receptor antagonists, respectively. Using in vivo electrochemistry, we show that these changes could be associated with higher levels of dopamine in the brain. Thus, in adult zebrafish, though not in larvae, TDF exposure increases locomotor activity, anxiety and aggressiveness, which coincides with the behaviors observed in mammals.",,England,2019,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.12.012,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Behavior and Dopamine and Serotonin and Triadimefon and Zebrafish,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30593828

However, over the course of drug exposure the control over drug seeking progressively devolves to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms. The causal importance of this functional recruitment of aDLS in the switch from controlled to compulsive drug use in vulnerable individuals remains to be established. Here we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the susceptibility to aDLS dopamine-dependent control over alcohol seeking predicts and underlies the development of compulsive alcohol seeking. Male alcohol-preferring rats, the alcohol-preferring phenotype of which was confirmed in an intermittent two-bottle choice procedure, were implanted bilaterally with cannulae above the aDLS and trained instrumentally on a seeking-taking chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement until some individuals developed compulsive seeking behavior. The susceptibility to aDLS dopamine control over behavior was investigated before and after the development of compulsivity by measuring the extent to which bilateral aDLS infusions of the dopamine receptor antagonist Î±-flupenthixol (0, 5, 10, and 15 Î¼g/side) decreased alcohol seeking at different stages of training, as follows: (1) after acquisition of instrumental taking responses for alcohol; (2) after alcohol-seeking behavior was well established; and (3) after the development of punishment-resistant alcohol seeking. Only alcohol-seeking, not alcohol-taking, responses became dependent on aDLS dopamine. Further, marked individual differences in the susceptibility of alcohol seeking to aDLS dopamine receptor blockade actually predicted the vulnerability to develop compulsive alcohol seeking, but only in subjects dependent on aDLS dopamine-dependent control.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Over the course of addictive drug exposure, there is a transition in the control over drug seeking from ventral to anterior dorsal striatum (aDLS) dopamine-dependent mechanisms, but it is unclear whether this is causally involved in the development of compulsive drug seeking. We tested the hypothesis that individual differences in the reliance of alcohol seeking on aDLS dopamine predicts and underlies the emergence of compulsive alcohol seeking. We identified individual differences in the reliance of well established alcohol seeking, but not taking behavior, on aDLS mechanisms and also showed that this predicted the subsequent development of compulsive alcohol-seeking behavior.

To further our knowledge of the activity of N-benzyltryptamines, we have synthesized a family of tryptamine derivatives and, for comparison, a few 5-methoxytryptamine analogs with many different substitution patterns on the benzyl moiety, and subjected them to in vitro affinity and functional activity assays vs. the human 5-HT2 receptor subtypes. In the binding (radioligand displacement) studies some of these compounds exhibited only modest selectivity for either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors suggesting that a few of them, with affinities in the 10-100 nanomolar range for 5-HT2A receptors, might presumably be psychedelic. Unexpectedly, their functional (calcium mobilization) assays reflected very different trends.

Despite this, ascribing a specific set of functions to brain serotonin and its receptors has been difficult and controversial. The 2A subtype of serotonin receptors (5-HT2A receptor) is the major excitatory serotonin receptor in the brain and has been linked to the effects of drugs that produce profound sensory and cognitive changes. Numerous studies have shown that this receptor is upregulated by a broad variety of stressors, and have related 5-HT2A receptor function to associative learning. This review proposes that stress, particularly stress related to danger and existential threats, increases the expression and function of 5-HT2A receptors. It is argued that this is a neurobiological adaptation to promote learning and avoidance of danger in the future. Upregulation of 5-HT2A receptors during stressful events forms associations that tune the brain to environmental cues that signal danger. It is speculated that life-threatening situations may activate this system and contribute to the symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, which activates 5-HT2A receptors, has been successful in the treatment of PTSD and has recently achieved status as a breakthrough therapy. An argument is presented that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine may paradoxically act through these same 5-HT2A receptors to ameliorate the symptoms of PTSD. The central thematic contention is that a key role of serotonin may be to function as a stress detection and response system.",,England,2019,10.1097/FBP.0000000000000459,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30632995

Accordingly, pharmacological agents that influence catecholamine neurotransmission exert prominent effects on cognition. Many such agents are used clinically to treat attention disorders. For example, methylphenidate blocks DA and NE reuptake and is the leading choice for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) treatment. Recently, we have designed SK609 - a selective small molecule agonist of the DA D3 receptor (D3R). In this study, we further characterized SK609's ability to selectively inhibit the reuptake of NE by NE transporters (NET). Our results indicate SK609 selectively inhibits NET with a K(i) value of âˆ¼500â€¯nM and behaves as a NET substrate. Systemic dosing of SK609 (4â€¯mg/kg; i.p.) in naÃ¯ve rats produced a 300% and 160% increase in NE and DA, respectively, in the PFC as measured by microdialysis. Based on these neurochemical results, SK609 was tested in a PFC-dependent, visually-guided sustained attention task in rats. SK609 improved performance in a dose-dependent manner with a classical inverted-U dose response function with a peak effect at 4â€¯mg/kg. SK609's peak effect was blocked by a pre-treatment with either the D2/D3R antagonist raclopride (0.05â€¯mg/kg; i.p) or the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin (0.25â€¯mg/kg; i.p), confirming a role for both DA and NE in promoting sustained attention. Additionally, SK609 improved sustained attention more prominently among low-performing animals. Doses of SK609 (2, 4, and 8â€¯mg/kg) associated with cognitive enhancement did not produce an increase in spontaneous locomotor activity, suggesting a lack of side effects mediated by DA transporter (DAT) activity.

MSCs were harvested from adipose tissue using a collagenase enzyme digestion method and were allowed to differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells. Various concentrations of fluoxetine were added to the cells, which were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry to detect apoptotic markers Annexin V and caspaseâ€‘3, in order to assess the levels of apoptosis. The levels of endogenous serotonin released in the extracellular matrix were measured using a serotonin ELISA kit.

Disturbances in DA signaling have been linked to an array of different neurologic and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and addiction, but the underlying pathologic mechanisms have never been fully elucidated. One major obstacle limiting interpretation of standard pharmacological and transgenic interventions is the complexity of the DA system, which only appears to widen as research progresses. Nonetheless, development of new genetic tools, such as chemogenetics, has led to an entirely new era for functional studies of neuronal signaling. By exploiting receptors that are engineered to respond selectively to an otherwise inert ligand, so-called Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs), chemogenetics enables pharmacological remote control of neuronal activity. Here we review the recent, extensive application of this technique to the DA field and how its use has advanced the study of the DA system and contributed to our general understanding of DA signaling and related behaviors. Moreover, we discuss the challenges and pitfalls associated with the chemogenetic technology, such as the metabolism of the DREADD ligand clozapine N-oxide (CNO) to the D2 receptor antagonist clozapine. We conclude that despite the recent concerns regarding CNO, the chemogenetic toolbox provides an exceptional approach to study neuronal function.

Although they have been used since ancient times and are still in use today, the mechanistic basis for their regulation of adrenergic receptors (ARs) is still not clear. PURPOSE: In this study, we aimed to determine the active components and mechanisms of action of CRP, AFI and AF in treating gastrointestinal disorders related to ARs. METHODS: First, the phenethylamine alkaloid components of CRP, AFI and AF were identified and compared across 30 samples of three Citrus species by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS in combination with content difference analysis. Second, the effect of the main active alkaloid component on AR-based gastrointestinal disorders was investigated by an in vivo small intestinal propulsive test and an in vitro relaxing small intestinal smooth muscle activity test. The mechanism of AR regulation of the active alkaloid was further studied by evaluating its effect on relaxing small intestinal smooth muscle in the presence of an inhibitor. Lastly, the enzymes, which played an important role in epinephrine synthesis and AR regulation, were detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Three phenethylamine AR regulators (N-methyltyramine, synephrine and hordenine) in CRP, AFI and AF were characterized. It was found that N-methyltyramine could relax mouse small intestinal smooth muscle and inhibit small intestinal propulsion. The effect of N-methyltyramine on relaxing small intestinal smooth muscle could be inhibited by a-methyl-l-tyrosine. The enzymes related epinephrine synthesis and AR function were found in the mouse small intestine. The biotransformation process that converts N-methyltyramine to epinephrine was determined. CONCLUSION: The treatment of gastrointestinal disorders of CRP, AFI and AF is associated with their alkaloid component N-methyltyramine via the regulation of ARs, and the mechanism is considered to be the biotransformation of N-methyltyramine to epinephrine by serial synthase, which takes place at the nerves cells in small intestine.",,France,2019,10.1016/j.biopha.2018.12.145,Journal Article,Adrenergic receptor and Biotransformation and Citrus species and N-methyltyramine and Treating gastrointestinal disorders,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30841454

These results revealed that a single facial injection of BoNT/A induced a rapid and prolonged improvement of depression-like behaviors in naÃ¯ve and space-restriction-stressed (SRS) mice, reflected by a decreased duration of immobility in behavioral despair tests. BoNT/A significantly increased the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and hypothalamus, in SRS mice. BoNT/A increased the expression of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B in the hippocampus, which were significantly decreased in SRS mice. Furthermore, BoNT/A significantly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala, which were decreased in SRS mice. Finally, BoNT/A transiently increased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and cAMP-response element binding protein (p-CREB), which were suppressed in the hippocampus of SRS mice. Collectively, these results demonstrated that BoNT/A treatment has anti-depressant-like activity in mice, and this is associated with increased 5-HT levels and the activation of BDNF/ERK/CREB pathways in the hippocampus, supporting further investigation of BoNT/A therapy in depression.",,Singapore,2019,10.1007/s12264-019-00367-8,Journal Article,5-HT and BDNF and Botulinum neurotoxin and Depression and Hippocampus,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30900142

This study examined the question of whether lesion-induced sprouting of dopaminergic axons is associated with changes in dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase and dopamine receptor density in the partially denervated olfactory tubercle. The results indicate that dopamine- and NaF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity increased as early as 7 d, while forskolin-sensitive activity increased at 3 d and persisted up to 20 d after lesioning; higher levels of GTP- and NaF-stimulated enzyme activity were found in detergent extracts of olfactory tubercle membranes from 20 d lesioned rats; higher levels of 3H-forskolin binding were found in membranes from 14 and 20 d lesioned rats; and there was an increase in dopamine receptor density, but not affinity, in olfactory tubercle membranes from lesioned rats.

After this conditioning period half of the rats received haloperidol in the haloperidol-associated environment, whereas the other half received haloperidol in the saline-associated environment. All rats were tested for catalepsy and at the end of the last catalepsy test, striatal DOPAC, HVA and ACh were determined. Only the rats tested in the haloperidol-associated environment were behaviourally tolerant to haloperidol. In contrast, both groups were biochemically tolerant to haloperidol. These results indicate that environmental cue factors govern the development of behavioural tolerance to haloperidol, rather than biochemical factors (striatal DA super-sensitivity).

The interaction between serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) could play a role as upstream effectors involved in mediating associations between anorectic and noxious/stressful stimuli. We hypothesize that 5-HT acts as an endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system to mediate satiation and malaise in rats. Here, we investigate whether interactions between central 5-HT and GLP-1 signaling are behaviorally and physiologically relevant for the control of food intake and pica (i.e., behavioral measure of malaise). Results show that the anorexia and body weight changes induced by administration of exogenous hindbrain 5-HT are dependent on central GLP-1 receptor signaling. Furthermore, anatomical evidence shows mRNA expression of 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptors on GLP-1-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius by fluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that PPG neurons are likely to express both of these receptors. Behaviorally, the hypophagia induced by the pharmacological activation of both of these receptors is also dependent on GLP-1 signaling. Finally, 5-HT3, but not 5-HT2C receptors, are required for the anorectic effects of the interoceptive stressor LiCl, suggesting the hypophagia induced by these 5-HT receptors may be driven by different mechanisms. Our findings highlight 5-HT as a novel endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system and suggest that the central interaction between 5-HT and GLP-1 is involved in the control of food intake in rats.",,England,2019,10.1038/s41386-019-0384-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-30959513

Spontaneous firing rates were increased relative to control values when recorded 4-8 days or 4-6 weeks postlesion in animals displaying aphagia, adipsia and akinesia. In contrast, spontaneous activity was not increased when recorded 4-6 weeks after the lesion in animals that had recovered from behavioral deficits. Other animals that had recovered from the effects of an earlier 6-OHDA treatment were given either a second injection of 6-OHDA or a systemic injection of haloperidol, a DA receptor antagonist. In both groups, discharge rates were elevated relative to control levels in association with a reinstatement of behavioral deficits. These results demonstrate that behavioral recovery after large DA-depleting brain lesions is associated with a return of spontaneous activity of striatal neurons to normal levels, and suggest that both behavioral and electrophysiological measures are dependent on the functioning of residual elements of the DA system.",,Netherlands,1986,10.1016/0006-8993(86)91481-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3099976

Based on these findings, we used fMRI in healthy human participants and measured the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations to assess spontaneous neural activity strength in regions of the mesostriatal dopamine system before and after tDCS over prefrontal regions (n = 40, 22 females). In a second study, we examined the effect of a single dose of the dopamine precursor levodopa (l-DOPA) on mesostriatal fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values in male humans (n = 22) and compared the results between both studies.

Adverse reactions from these drugs, however, have been regularly reported, with allergic skin reactions noted in some cases. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying anaphylaxis by these drugs have not been described. In the present study, we found that phenothiazine antipsychotics increased calcium mobilization and activated mast cells to release Î²-hexosaminidase, histamine, and tumor necrosis factor-Î± via Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor member X2 (MRGPRX2) in vitro. In addition, they induced histamine release in serum via Mrgprb2 in C57BL/6 mice without Evans blue extravasation or paw swell. Further experiments indicated these drugs had good interaction with the histamine H(1) receptor (H1R) and show an anti-calcium mobilization effect on H(1)R-HEK293 cells, which confirmed a potential antagonist effect of these drugs on the H(1)R. The molecular docking and activity experiments indicated that the N-methyl substitution on the side chain of these drugs played a significant role in activating MRGPRX2, while the phenothiazine tricyclic ring was associated with the inhibiting effect on the H(1)R. Therefore, due to their dual properties of increasing histamine levels without obvious allergic symptoms, clinicians should be highly vigilant for damage from histamine accumulation and long-term inflammatory reactions during the clinical use of phenothiazine antipsychotics.",,England,2019,10.1016/j.molimm.2019.04.008,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",H(1) receptor antagonist and MRGPRX2 and Mast cell and Phenothiazine antipsychotics and Pseudo-allergic reactions,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31051313

Methods: We examined whether intra-dHip injection of both 5-HT(6) receptor agonist and antagonist was involved in the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors in sham-operated rats and rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle by the open-field and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. Four weeks after injection of 6-OHDA, the concentrations of dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in relative related brain regions were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: In sham-operated rats, intra-dHip injection of both 5-HT(6) receptor agonist WAY208466 (3 and 6 Âµg/rat) and antagonist SB258585 (4 Âµg/rat) increased the percentage of time spent in the center area in the open-field test and percentages of open arm entries and open arm time in EPM test, indicating that induced anxiolytic effects. In the lesioned rats, WAY208466 (1.5, 3 and 6 Âµg/rat) produced anxiolytic responses, whereas SB258585 (2 and 4 Âµg/rat) produced anxiogenic effects. Neurochemical results showed that intra-dHip injection of WAY208466 (6 Âµg/rat) decreased NA level in the amygdala, and SB258585 (4 Âµg/rat) increased DA levels in the dHip and vHip in sham-operated rats, whereas WAY208466 increased DA levels in the dHip, vHip, and amygdala in the lesioned rats.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the metabolic, microcirculatory parameters, and histologic changes under the effect of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) in a renal I/R model in rats. METHOD: In 26 anesthetized rats both kidneys were exposed. In the control group (nÂ = 6) no other intervention happened. In 20 other animals, the right renal vessels were ligated, and after 60 minutes the right kidney was removed. The left renal vessels were clamped for 60 minutes then released, followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion. In the I/R group (nÂ =Â 10), there was no additive treatment, while in I/RÂ + DMT group (nÂ = 10) DMT was administered 15 minutes before ischemia. Blood samples were taken, laser Doppler measurement was performed, and both kidneys were evaluated histologically. RESULTS: Microcirculation (blood flux units [BFU]) diminished in all groups, but remarkably so in the I/RÂ + DMT group. This group compensated better after the 30th minute of reperfusion. The control and I/RÂ + DMT groups had similar BFUs after 120 minutes of reperfusion, but in the I/R group BFU was higher. Tubular necrosis developed in the I/R and I/RÂ + DMT groups too; it was moderated under DMT effect, and severe without. Histologic injuries were less in I/RÂ + DMT Group compared to non-treated animals.

Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the CB(1) receptor ligands (oleamide and AM251) affect the activity of the common antidepressant drugs that influence the monoaminergic system. In order to determine the antidepressant-like activity, the forced swim test and the tail suspension test in mice were used. Additionally, brain concentrations of the tested antidepressants were evaluated by the HPLC method. Concurrent intraperitoneal administration of per se inactive doses of oleamide (5â€¯mg/kg) or AM251 (0.25â€¯mg/kg) and imipramine (15â€¯mg/kg), escitalopram (2â€¯mg/kg), and reboxetine (2.5â€¯mg/kg) reduced the immobility time of animals in the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. The observed effect was not associated with hyperlocomotion of animals. Summarizing, the outcomes of the present study demonstrated that modulation (i.e., activation or inhibition) of the CB(1) receptor function potentiates the antidepressant activity of common drugs that influence the monoaminergic (serotonergic and noradrenergic) system.

Pretreatment with haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) antagonised the place preference induced by diazepam (1 mg/kg). Pretreatment with domperidone (2 mg/kg) failed to influence this effect of diazepam.

Unfortunately, available pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments have small effect sizes, and improved treatments are needed. Smoking and AUD share heritability and are pharmacologically associated, since drug-induced dopamine (DA) output in nucleus accumbens (nAc) involves nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in both cases. Smoking therapy agents, such as the partial nAChR agonist varenicline or the DA/noradrenaline transporter inhibitor bupropion, could potentially also be used for AUD. To investigate this hypothesis, the effects of varenicline, bupropion, or a combination of the two on nAc DA levels, ethanol intake, and the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) were examined. In vivo microdialysis showed that varenicline (1.5Â mg/kg) and bupropion (2.5, 5, or 10Â mg/kg) elevated nAc DA levels and that the combination produced additive effects. Five days treatment with varenicline, bupropion, or the combination did not suppress ethanol consumption, as compared with vehicle-treated control.

Despite the numerous reports on the effects of Radix rehmanniae extract (RRE) on various types of depression, there are few studies exploring the effects of RRE on the menopausal anxiety and depression. PURPOSE: To investigate whether RRE could alleviate the menopausal anxiety and depression in ovariectomized (OVX) mice submitted to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). METHODS: OVX mice were treated with 2.6â€¯g/kg RRE for 5 weeks. After a series of behavior tests, serum, uterus, and brain tissues were collected for the measurement of neurotransmitters and their related biomarkers, neurotrophins, and estrogen receptor Î± (ERÎ±) and Î² (ERÎ²). RESULTS: RRE showed antidepressant and anxiolytic effects through these behavior tests, but had no effects on the OVX-induced weight gains, uterine shrinkage and drop of serum estrogen level. RRE restored the levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), Glutamate (Glu), gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and their related biomarkers in different brain regions. RRE also reversed OVX-induced decrease in the expression levels of neurotrophins in uterus and brain regions except for uterine nerve growth factor (NGF). Moreover, RRE restored and even enhanced ERÎ² expression levels in uterus and brain without affecting uterine, hippocampal and cortical ERÎ±. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of RRE in OVX mice, which were possibly mediated via their modulation of brain neurotransmitters, and regulation of neurotrophins and activation of ERÎ².",,Germany,2019,10.1016/j.phymed.2019.153012,Journal Article,Anxiety and Depression and Menopause and Radix rehmanniae extract and estrogen receptor (ER<ce><b2>) and neurotrophins,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31301535

However, severe side effects, including abnormal mental functions, behavioral disturbances and intolerance are associated with this treatment. 5-HTP-induced elevation of plasma and brain serotonin levels may affect blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, edema formation and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) disturbances. Breakdown of BBB to serum proteins leads to vasogenic brain edema formation and cellular injuries. However, 5-HTP-neurotoxicity is still not well known. In this investigations 5-HTP induced elevation of endogenous plasma and brain serotonin levels and its effect on BBB breakdown, edema formation neuronal injuries was examined in a rat model. Furthermore, potential role of oxidative stress and nitric oxide (NO) was evaluated. In addition, several neurochemical agents such as p-CPA (5-HT synthesis inhibitor) indomethacin (prostaglandin synthase inhibitor), diazepam (ant stress drug), cyproheptadine, ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonists) and vinblastine (inhibitor of microtubule function) were examined on 5-HT neurotoxicity. Our observations suggest that 4h after 5-HTP administrations, the endogenous serotonin levels increased by fourfold (150mg/kg) in the plasma and brain associated with profound hyperthermia (+3.86Â±0.24Â°C, oxidative stress and NO upregulation. Breakdown of the BBB to Evans blue albumin (EBA) in 8 brain regions and to ([131])Iodine in 14 brain regions was observed. The CBF exhibited marked reduction in all the brain regions examined. Brain edema and cellular injuries are present in the areas associated with BBB disruption. Drug treatments reduced the BBB breakdown, edema formation NO production and brain pathology.

Consistent with the evidence that MCHergic neurons send projections to dorsal and median raphe nuclei, we have previously demonstrated that MCH microinjections in both nuclei induced a depressive-like behavior. Even though MCH neurons also project to Locus Coeruleus (LC), only a few studies have reported the behavioral and neurochemical effect of MCH into the LC. We studied the effects of MCH (100 and 200â€‰ng) into the LC on coping-stress related behaviors associated with depression, using two different behavioral tests: the forced swimming test (FST) and the learned helplessness (LH). To characterize the functional interaction between MCH and the noradrenergic LC system, we also evaluated the neurochemical effects of MCH (100â€‰ng) on the extracellular levels of noradrenaline (NA) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an important LC terminal region involved in emotional processing. MCH administration into the LC elicited a depressive-like behavior evidenced in both paradigms. Interestingly, in the LH, MCH (100) elicited a significant increase in escape failures only in stressed animals. A significant decrease in prefrontal levels of NA was observed after MCH microinjection into the LC. Our results demonstrate that increased MCH signaling into the LC triggers depressive-like behaviors, especially in stressed animals.

However, a serotonin syndrome is not always followed by serotonergic injury, indicating different mechanisms responsible for two adverse effects. The goal of present study was to determine causes for two adverse events and further test that dose and environment have a differential role in initiating and intensifying MDMA neurotoxicity. METHODS: Initiation and intensification were examined by comparing neurotoxic effects of a high-dose (10â€‰mg/kgâ€‰Ã—â€‰3 at 2â€‰h intervals) with a low-dose (2â€‰mg/kgâ€‰Ã—â€‰3) under controlled-environmental conditions. Initiation of a serotonin syndrome was estimated by measuring extracellular 5-HT, body-core temperature, electroencephalogram and MDMA concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, while intensification determined in rats examined under modified environment. Initiation and intensification of the serotonergic injury were assessed in rats by measuring tissue 5-HT content, SERT density and functional integrity of serotonergic retrograde transportation. RESULTS: Both low- and high-dose could cause increases in extracellular 5-HT to elicit a serotonin syndrome at the same intensity. Modification of environmental conditions, which had no impact on MDMA-elicited increases in 5-HT levels, markedly intensified the syndrome intensity. Although either dose would cause the severe syndrome under modified environments, only the high-dose that resulted in high MDMA concentrations in the brain could cause serotonergic injury. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that extracellular 5-HT is the cause of a syndrome and activity of postsynaptic receptors critical for the course of syndrome intensification. Although the high-dose has the potential to initiate serotonergic injury due to high MDMA concentrations present in the brain, whether an injury is observed depends upon the drug environment via the levels of reactive oxygen species generated. This suggests that brain MDMA concentration is the determinant in the injury initiation while reactive oxygen species generation associated with the injury intensification. It is concluded that the two adverse events utilize distinctly different mediating molecules during the toxic initiation and intensification.",,England,2019,10.1186/s40360-019-0326-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",EEG and Environment and Hyperthermia and Hypothermia and Initiation and Intensification and MDMA toxicity and Microdialysis and Serotonergic injury and Serotonin syndrome,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31383036

However, whether 5-HT plays a functional role in bacteria from the gut microbiota remains unknown. We demonstrate that elevating levels of intestinal lumenal 5-HT by oral supplementation or genetic deficiency in the host 5-HT transporter (SERT) increases the relative abundance of spore-forming members of the gut microbiota, which were previously reported to promote host 5-HT biosynthesis. Within this microbial community, we identify Turicibacter sanguinis as a gut bacterium that expresses a neurotransmitter sodium symporter-related protein with sequence and structural homology to mammalian SERT. T. sanguinis imports 5-HT through a mechanism that is inhibited by the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. 5-HT reduces the expression of sporulation factors and membrane transporters in T. sanguinis, which is reversed by fluoxetine exposure. Treating T. sanguinis with 5-HT or fluoxetine modulates its competitive colonization in the gastrointestinal tract of antibiotic-treated mice. In addition, fluoxetine reduces the membership of T. sanguinis in the gut microbiota of conventionally colonized mice. Host association with T. sanguinis alters intestinal expression of multiple gene pathways, including those important for lipid and steroid metabolism, with corresponding reductions in host systemic triglyceride levels and inguinal adipocyte size. Together, these findings support the notion that select bacteria indigenous to the gut microbiota signal bidirectionally with the host serotonergic system to promote their fitness in the intestine.",,England,2019,10.1038/s41564-019-0540-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31477894

In a chronic stress model, a single low-dose administration of scopolamine reversed depressive-like reactivity. This antidepressant-like effect was mediated via a muscarinic M1 receptor-SKC pathway because it was mimicked by intra-medial prefrontal cortex (intra-mPFC) infusions of scopolamine, of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine or of the SKC antagonist apamin, but not by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant fluoxetine. Extracellular and whole-cell recordings revealed that scopolamine and ketamine attenuate the SKC-mediated action potential hyperpolarization current and rapidly enhance mPFC neuronal excitability within the therapeutically relevant time window. The SKC agonist 1-EBIO abrogated scopolamine-induced antidepressant activity at a dose that completely suppressed burst firing activity. Scopolamine also induced a slow-onset activation of raphe serotonergic neurons, which in turn was dependent on mPFC-induced neuroplasticity or excitatory input, since mPFC transection abolished this effect. These early behavioral and mPFC activational effects of scopolamine did not appear to depend on prefrontocortical brain-derived neurotrophic factor and serotonin-1A activity, classically linked to SSRIs, and suggest a novel mechanism associated with antidepressant response onset through SKC-mediated regulation of activity-dependent plasticity.",,United States,2020,10.1093/cercor/bhz187,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",SK channel and chronic unpredictable mild stress and dorsal raphe nucleus and muscarinic M1 receptor and prelimbic cortex,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31504265

The present study examined the effect of AMPK on current generated by dopamine, which unlike quinpirole, is a substrate for the dopamine transporter (DAT). Using whole-cell patch-clamp, we constructed current-voltage (I-V) plots while superfusing brain slices with dopamine (100â€¯Î¼M) for 25â€¯min. Two minutes after starting superfusion, dopamine evoked a peak current with an average slope conductance of 0.97â€¯nS and an estimated reversal potential (E(rev)) of -113â€¯mV, which is near that expected for K(+). But after 10â€¯min of superfusion, dopamine-evoked currents had shifted to more depolarized values with a slope conductance of 0.64â€¯nS and an E(rev) of -83â€¯mV. This inward shift in current was completely blocked by the DAT inhibitor GBR12935. However, an AMPK blocking agent (dorsomorphin) permitted the emergence of inward current despite the continued presence of the DAT inhibitor. When D2 autoreceptors were blocked by sulpiride, I-V plots showed that dopamine evoked an inward current with an estimated slope conductance of 0.45â€¯nS with an E(rev) of -57â€¯mV. Moreover, this inward current was completely blocked by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) antagonist EPPTB. These results suggest that dopamine activates a TAAR1-dependent non-selective cation current that is regulated by AMPK.",,United States,2020,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2019.11.044,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",AMP kinase and brain slice and dopamine and dopamine transporter and patch-clamp and trace amine,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31883822

These disorders are frequently associated with cognitive deficits in attention or learning and memory, suggesting that persistent activation of dopamine signaling may change neural plasticity to induce cognitive or emotional malfunction. METHODS: Dopamine transporter knockdown (DAT-KD) mice were used to mimic a hyper-dopamine state. Novel object recognition (NOR) task was performed to assess the recognition memory. To test the role of dopamine D(3) receptor (D(3)R) on NOR, DAT-KD mice were treated with either a D(3)R antagonist, FAUC365 or by deletion of D(3)R. Total or phospho-GSK3 and -ERK1/2 signals in various brain regions were measured by Western blot analyses. To examine the impact of GSK3 signal on NOR, wild-type mice were systemically treated with GSK3 inhibitor SB216763 or, micro-injected with lentiviral shRNA of GSK3Î² or GSK3Î± in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). RESULTS: We confirmed our previous findings that DAT-KD mice displayed a deficit in NOR memory, which could be prevented by deletion of D(3)R or exposure to FAUC365. In WT mice, p-GSK3Î± and p-GSK3Î² were significantly decreased in the mPFC after exposure to novel objects; however, the DAT-KD mice exhibited no such change in mPFC p-GSK3Î±/Î² levels. DAT-KD mice treated with FAUC365 or with D(3)R deletion exhibited restored novelty-induced GSK3 dephosphorylation in the mPFC. Moreover, inhibition of GSK3 in WT mice diminished NOR performance and impaired recognition memory. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of GSK3Î², but not GSK3Î±, in the mPFC of WT mice also impaired NOR. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that D(3)R acts via GSK3Î² signaling in the mPFC to play a functional role in NOR memory. In addition, treatment with D(3)R antagonists may be a reasonable approach for ameliorating cognitive impairments or episodic memory deficits in bipolar disorder patients.",,England,2020,10.1186/s12929-019-0613-y,Journal Article,Dopamine and Dopamine D3 receptor and Dopamine transporter knockdown (DAT-KD) and Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and Novel object recognition (NOR),,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-31900153

Previous work identified the trace amine-associated receptor 1 gene (Taar1) as a quantitative trait gene for MA intake that also impacts thermal response to MA. All MAHDR mice are homozygous for the mutant Taar1 (m1J) allele, whereas all MALDR mice possess at least one copy of the reference Taar1 (+) allele. To determine if their differential sensitivity to MA-induced hypothermia extends to drugs of similar and different classes, we examined sensitivity to the hypothermic effect of the stimulant cocaine, the amphetamine-like substance 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and the opioid morphine in these lines. The lines did not differ in thermal response to cocaine, only MALDR mice exhibited a hypothermic response to MDMA, and MAHDR mice were more sensitive to the hypothermic effect of morphine than MALDR mice. We speculated that the Î¼-opioid receptor gene (Oprm1) impacts morphine response, and genotyped the mice tested for morphine-induced hypothermia. We report genetic linkage between Taar1 and Oprm1; MAHDR mice more often inherit the Oprm1 (D2) allele and MALDR mice more often inherit the Oprm1 (B6) allele. Data from a family of recombinant inbred mouse strains support the influence of Oprm1 genotype, but not Taar1 genotype, on thermal response to morphine.

Using local-field-potential recording in the rat prefrontal cortex (PFC), we have shown that systemic administration of methylphenidate promotes PFC Up states and reduces PFC slow oscillation, suggesting a depolarizing effect of the drug on PFC neurons. Here, we report that systemic injection of d-amphetamine produced similar effects. Our evidence further suggests that norepinephrine (NE) plays a major role in the effects of d-amphetamine since they were mimicked by the NE reuptake inhibitors tomoxetine and nisoxetine and completely blocked by the Î±(1) receptor antagonist prazosin. The effects of d-amphetamine persisted, however, in the presence of Î±(2) or Î² receptor blockade. Experiments with Î±(1) subtype-selective antagonists further suggest that d-amphetamine's effects depend on activation of central, but not peripheral, Î±(1A) receptors. Unexpectedly, the putative Î±(1) receptor agonist cirazoline failed to mimic the effects of d-amphetamine. Previous studies suggest that cirazoline is also an antagonist at Î±(2) receptors. Furthermore, it is a partial, not full, agonist at Î±(1B) and Î±(1D) receptors. Whether or not these properties of cirazoline contribute to its failure to mimic d-amphetamine's effects remains to be determined. Methylphenidate and d-amphetamine are two most common medications for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Both, however, are associated with adverse effects including abuse potential and psychotomimetic effects.

The kynurenine pathway is a paramount source of several immunoregulatory metabolites, including l-kynurenine (Kyn), the main product of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) that catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the pathway. In the serotonin pathway, the metabolite N-acetylserotonin (NAS) has been shown to possess antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and neuroprotective properties in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, little is known about the exact mode of action of the serotonin metabolite and the possible interplay between the 2 Trp metabolic pathways. Prompted by the discovery that NAS neuroprotective effects in EAE are abrogated in mice lacking IDO1 expression, we investigated the NAS mode of action in neuroinflammation. We found that NAS directly binds IDO1 and acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the IDO1 enzyme in vitro and in vivo. As a result, increased Kyn will activate the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor and, consequently, antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. Because NAS also increased IDO1 activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a significant proportion of MS patients, our data may set the basis for the development of IDO1 PAMs as first-in-class drugs in autoimmune/neuroinflammatory diseases.",,United States,2020,10.1073/pnas.1918215117,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","N-acetylserotonin (NAS) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and dendritic cells and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and neuroinflammation",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32024760

Recent evidence also suggests that OT can play an important role in the mediation of anxiety-associated defensive responses, including a role for serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission in this action. However, it is presently unknown whether OT additionally regulates the expression of panic-related behaviors, such as escape, by acting in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), a key panic-regulating area. This study aimed to investigate the consequence of OT injection in the dPAG on escape expression and whether facilitation of 5-HT neurotransmission in this midbrain area is implicated in this action. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were injected with OT in the dPAG and tested for escape expression in the elevated T-maze (ETM) and dPAG electrical stimulation tests. Using the latter test, OT's effect was also investigated after previous intra-dPAG injection of the OT receptor antagonist atosiban, the preferential antagonists of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors, WAY-100635 and ketanserin, respectively, or systemic pretreatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-CPA. RESULTS: OT impaired escape expression in the two tests used, suggesting a panicolytic-like effect. In the ETM, the peptide also facilitated inhibitory avoidance acquisition, indicating an anxiogenic effect. Previous administration of atosiban, WAY-100635, ketanserin, or p-CPA counteracted OT's anti-escape effect. CONCLUSIONS: OT and 5-HT in the dPAG interact in the regulation of panic- and anxiety-related defensive responses.

A polymorphic form of NQO1 is associated with mood disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the role of NQO1 in dopaminergic system has not yet been elucidated. To determine the role of NQO1 in the dopaminergic system, we investigated pharmaco-behavioral effects of d-amphetamine using NQO1-deficienct mice. According to our comparative study involving NQO1(+/+) and NQO1(-/-) mice, NQO1 deficiency increased d-amphetamine-induced psychomotor activity and psychological dependency compared to wild-type mice. Basal and d-amphetamine-induced dopamine levels were also enhanced by NQO1 deficiency. In NQO1(-/-) mice, neural activation induced by d-amphetamine was higher in dorsolateral striatum, but not in dorsomedial and ventral striata. Although protein level of CaMKIIÎ±, which is a key player in amphetamine-induced dopamine efflux, was decreased in striata of NQO1(-/-) mice, phosphorylation of CaMKIIÎ± was markedly enhanced in NQO1(-/-) mice compared to wild-type mice. Interestingly, experiments with pharmacological antagonist showed that D2 antagonist-induced suppression of locomotion required activation of NQO1. Moreover, the rewarding effect in response to D1 agonist was increased by NQO1 deficiency.

We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal.

The agonist dissociation constant for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was estimated in the guinea-pig isolated trachea by the method of receptor inactivation. The value obtained (pKA = 6.45) was significantly lower than estimates previously obtained in the rabbit aorta and rat jugular vein, although all three tissues are supposed to contain the same 5-HT2 class of receptor. 2. The antagonist dissociation constant for alpha,alpha-dimethyltryptamine was also estimated in the guinea-pig trachea. The pKB value (5.43) was not significantly different from previous estimates in the rabbit aorta and rat jugular vein, consistent with receptor homogeneity between the three tissues. 3. The effect-time profiles corresponding to individual 5-HT applications were more transient in the guinea-pig trachea than in the rabbit aorta. This difference could be accounted for using a simple model of acute receptor desensitization (Leff, 1986), assuming that the conversion of active agonist-receptor complexes into inactive ones was faster in the guinea-pig trachea than in the rabbit aorta. 4. Computer simulation of the desensitization model showed that the discrepancy of pKA estimates for 5-HT between the rabbit aorta and guinea-pig trachea could also be explained using the same rate constant difference that accounted for the difference in effect-time profiles. This analysis indicated that the estimate made in the trachea was erroneously low, whereas that made in the aorta was concluded to be correct. 5.

Whereas most studies on NRG1-ErbB4 signaling have focused on GABAergic interneurons, ErbB4 is also expressed by midbrain dopaminergic neurons where it modulates extracellular dopamine (DA) levels. Here, we report that extracellular steady-state levels of DA are reduced in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; -65%), hippocampus (-53%) and nucleus accumbens (NAc; -35%), but are elevated in the dorsal striatum (+25%) of ErbB4 knock-out mice (ErbB4 KOs) relative to wild-type controls. This pattern of DA imbalance recapitulates the reported prefrontal cortical reduction and striatal increase of DA levels in schizophrenia patients. Next, we report on a battery of behavioral tasks used to evaluate locomotor, cognitive and motivational behaviors in ErbB4 KOs relative to controls. We found that ErbB4 KOs are hyperactive in a novel open field but not in their familiar home cage, are more sensitive to amphetamine, perform poorly in the T-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tasks, exhibit reduced spatial learning and memory on the Barnes maze, and perform markedly worse in conditioned place preference (CPP) tasks when associating cued-reward palatable food with location. However, we found that the poor performance of ErbB4 KOs in CPP are likely due to deficits in spatial memory, instead of reward seeking, as ErbB4 KOs are more motivated to work for palatable food rewards.

c1915168-e972-438a-8554-250b7e58e182,A pain-induced tonic hypodopaminergic state augments phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.,Gee TA and Weintraub NC and Lu D and Phelps CE and Navratilova E and Heien ML and Porreca F ,Pain,,"Diseases and disorders such as Parkinson disease, schizophrenia, and chronic pain are characterized by altered mesolimbic dopaminergic neurotransmission. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens influences behavior through both tonic and phasic signaling. Tonic dopamine levels are hypothesized to inversely regulate phasic signals through dopamine D2 receptor feedback inhibition. We tested this hypothesis directly in the context of ongoing pain. Tonic and phasic dopamine signals were measured using fast-scan controlled-adsorption voltammetry and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, respectively, in the nucleus accumbens shell of male rats with standardized levels of anesthesia. Application of capsaicin to the cornea produced a transient decrease in tonic dopamine levels. During the pain-induced hypodopaminergic state, electrically evoked phasic dopamine release was significantly increased when compared to baseline, evoked phasic release. A second application of capsaicin to the same eye had a lessened effect on tonic dopamine suggesting desensitization of TRPV1 channels in that eye. Capsaicin treatment in the alternate cornea, however, again produced coincident decreased dopaminergic tone and increased phasic dopamine release. These findings occurred independently of stimulus lateralization relative to the hemisphere of dopamine measurement. Our data show that (1) the mesolimbic dopamine circuit reliably encodes acute noxious stimuli; (2) ongoing pain produces decreases in dopaminergic tone; and (3) pain-induced decreases in tonic dopamine correspond to augmented evoked phasic dopamine release. Enhanced phasic dopamine neurotransmission resulting from salient stimuli may contribute to increased impulsivity and cognitive deficits often observed in conditions associated with decreased dopaminergic tone, including Parkinson disease and chronic pain.",,United States,2020,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001925,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32453137

Mechanisms by which the function of 5-HT1AR (expressed as an autoreceptor in serotonergic raphe neurons and as a heteroreceptor in serotonin [5-HT] projection areas) is altered include regulation of its expression, but 5-HT1AR trafficking may also be involved. METHODS: We investigated the consequences of the lack of Yif1B (the 5-HT1AR trafficking protein) on 5-HT neurotransmission in mice, and whether Yif1B expression might be affected under conditions known to alter 5-HT neurotransmission, such as anxious or depressive states or following treatment with fluoxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) in humans, monkeys and mice. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type mice, Yif1B-knockout mice showed a significant decrease in the forebrain density of 5-HT projection fibres and a hypofunctionality of 5-HT1A autoreceptors expressed on raphe 5-HT neurons. In addition, social interaction was less in Yif1B-knockout mice, which did not respond to the antidepressant-like effect of acute fluoxetine injection. In wild-type mice, social defeat was associated with downregulated Yif1B mRNA in the prefrontal cortex, and chronic fluoxetine treatment increased Yif1B expression. The expression of Yif1B was also downregulated in the postmortem prefrontal cortex of people with major depressive disorder and upregulated after chronic treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor in monkeys. LIMITATIONS: We found sex differences in Yif1B expression in humans and monkeys, but not in mice under the tested conditions. CONCLUSION: These data support the concept that Yif1B plays a critical role in 5-HT1AR functioning and brain 5-HT homeostasis. The opposite changes in its expression observed in anxious or depressive states and after therapeutic fluoxetine treatment suggest that Yif1B might be involved in vulnerability to anxiety and depression, and fluoxetine efficacy.",,Canada,2020,10.1503/jpn.190134,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32459080

We comparatively examined the effects of norepinephrine (NE) as an endogenous candidate regulator of PGN neurogenesis in the SVZ as well as the periventricular hypothalamus and the periaqueductal midbrain. Histological and neurochemical analyses revealed that the pattern of NE innervation of the adult PGNs is inversely associated with their in vivo NPC proliferation capacity with low NE levels coupled to high NPC proliferation in the SVZ but high NE levels coupled to low NPC proliferation in hypothalamic and midbrain PGNs. Intraventricular infusion of NE decreased NPC proliferation and neurogenesis in the SVZ-olfactory bulb system, while pharmacological NE inhibition increased NPC proliferation and early neurogenesis events in the caudal PGNs. Neurotoxic ablation of NE neurons using the Dsp4-fluoxetine protocol confirmed its inhibitory effects on NPC proliferation. Contrarily, NE depletion largely impairs NPC proliferation within the hippocampus in the same animals. Our data indicate that norepinephrine has opposite effects on the two fundamental neurogenic niches of the adult brain with norepinephrine being a negative regulator of adult periventricular neurogenesis.

Changes in serotonergic signaling during human fetal development have been associated with changes in brain development and with changes in affective behavior in adulthood. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is known to be modulated by serotonin and it is therefore assumed that SSRIs may affect circadian rhythms. However, effects of perinatal SSRI treatment on circadian system functioning in the offspring are largely unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effects of perinatal exposure to the SSRI fluoxetine (FLX) on circadian behavior, affective behavior, and 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity in female rats. In addition, we studied the expression of clock genes and the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the SCN, as they are potentially involved in underlying mechanisms contributing to changes in circadian rhythms. RESULTS: Perinatal FLX exposure shortened the free-running tau in response to the 5-HT(1A/7) agonist 8-OH-DPAT. However, FLX exposure did not alter anxiety, stress coping, and 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity. No differences were found in 5-HT(1A) receptor and clock genes Per1, Per2, Cry1, and Cry2 SCN gene expression.

The anorectic effect of the potent serotonin uptake inhibitor SL 81.0385 (ED50 = 4 mg/kg, i.p.) was potentiated by pretreatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan and blocked by the serotonin receptor antagonist metergoline. A good correlation (r = 0.98, p less than 0.01) was obtained between the ED50 values of anorectic action and the ED50 values of serotonin uptake inhibition in vivo (but not in vitro) for several specific serotonin uptake inhibitors. Most of the drugs tested displaced [3H]-mazindol from its binding to the anorectic recognition site in the hypothalamus, except the pro-drug zimelidine which was inactive (IC50 greater than 100 microM). Excluding zimelidine, a good correlation (r = 0.835, p less than 0.01) was obtained between the affinities of these drugs for [3H]-mazindol binding and their anorectic action indicating that their anorectic activity may be associated with an effect mediated through this site. Taken together these results suggest that the anorectic action of serotonin uptake inhibitors is directly associated to their ability to inhibit serotonin uptake and thus increasing the synaptic levels of serotonin.

The present study aimed to investigate whether the antidepressant effects of resveratrol involved in the energy levels and neurotransmission in the hippocampus. We found that resveratrol and fluoxetine significantly attenuated depressive-like behaviors induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), which evidenced by the increased sucrose preference and the reduced immobility time in a forced swimming test. In addition, resveratrol increased hippocampal ATP levels, decreased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase and pyruvate levels, and upregulated the levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), mRNA expression of sirtuin (SIRT)1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator (PGC)1Î±. Furthermore, resveratrol and fluoxetine increased serotonin (5-HT) levels and downregulated the mRNA expression of 5-HT transporter (SERT) in the hippocampus. The decreased protein expression of growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 induced by CUMS was also ameliorated by resveratrol and fluoxetine.

The mechanisms of the double-edged sword clinical action of NMDAR antagonists remained to be clarified. The present study determined the interaction between the NMDAR antagonist (MK801), Î±1 adrenoceptor antagonist (prazosin), and Î±2A adrenoceptor agonist (guanfacine) on mesocortical and mesothalamic catecholaminergic transmission, and thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission using multiprobe microdialysis. The inhibition of NMDAR in the locus coeruleus (LC) by local MK801 administration enhanced both the mesocortical noradrenergic and catecholaminergic coreleasing (norepinephrine and dopamine) transmissions. The mesothalamic noradrenergic transmission was also enhanced by local MK801 administration in the LC. These mesocortical and mesothalamic transmissions were activated by intra-LC disinhibition of transmission of Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via NMDAR inhibition. Contrastingly, activated mesothalamic noradrenergic transmission by MK801 enhanced intrathalamic GABAergic inhibition via the Î±1 adrenoceptor, resulting in the suppression of thalamocortical glutamatergic transmission. The thalamocortical glutamatergic terminal stimulated the presynaptically mesocortical catecholaminergic coreleasing terminal in the superficial cortical layers, but did not have contact with the mesocortical selective noradrenergic terminal (which projected terminals to deeper cortical layers). Furthermore, the Î±2A adrenoceptor suppressed the mesocortical and mesothalamic noradrenergic transmissions somatodendritically in the LC and presynaptically/somatodendritically in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RTN).

Pretreatment with different serotoninergic antagonists (pindolol, WAY100635 and ketanserin) blocked the anxiolytic effect caused by 4-PSQ (50 mg/kg, per oral) in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The contribution of the GABAergic system was investigated by pretreatment with pentylenetetrazole (a GABA(A) receptor antagonist) (PTZ). 4-PSQ diminished the PTZ-induced anxiety, and did not modify the locomotor, exploratory and motor activities of mice.

Finally, 4-PSQ restored the Na(+), K(+) ATPase activity in the cerebral structures evaluated.

This seems to be due mainly to the ability of NA to reduce the activation of microglial cells. We previously observed that NA induces the production of the chemokine Fractalkine/CX3CL1 in neurons. The activation of microglial CX3CR1, sole receptor for CX3CL1, reduces the activation of microglia, which is known to largely contribute to the neuronal damage characteristic of AD. Therefore, alterations of CX3CR1 production in microglia could translate into the enhancement or inhibition of CX3CL1 anti-inflammatory effects. In order to determine if microglial CX3CR1 production is altered in AD and if NA can control it, CX3CR1 expression and synthesis were analyzed in 5xFAD mice and human AD brain samples. In addition, the effects of NA and its reuptake inhibitor reboxetine were analyzed in microglial cultures and mice respectively. Our results indicate that in AD CX3CR1 production is increased in the brain cortex and that reboxetine administration further increases it and enhances microglial reactivity toward amyloid beta plaques.

Six-week-old KPPC mice were orally administered 4 mg/kg/d duloxetine (n = 12); 4 mg/kg/d duloxetine with 0.15 mg/kg/d atipamezole, a synthetic Î±2 adrenergic receptor antagonist (n = 9); or vehicle water (n = 11).

At the endpoint, the tumor status, angiogenesis, and immunoinflammatory condition were analyzed. The pain level using the hunching and mouse grimace scale scores improved by duloxetine in KPPC mice (P < 0.01), whereas the scores that had been reduced by duloxetine were elevated by administration of atipamezole. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that duloxetine-treated mice had significantly prolonged survival (P < 0.05) with delayed appetite loss, cachexia, and body weight loss. Duloxetine inhibited the proliferation of PDAC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in vivo with a shift into an antitumor immunoinflammatory condition and the corresponding plasma cytokine levels. The migrative/invasive potentials of PDAC were inhibited by duloxetine in vitro. Meanwhile, atipamezole did not inhibit the antitumor effects of duloxetine in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our results indicate that duloxetine mainly improves cancer-associated pain by enhancement of the noradrenergic pathway rather than the serotonergic pathway, whereas duloxetine modulates antitumor effects on PDAC without involvement of the noradrenergic pathway.",,United States,2020,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001997,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32694385

The high degree of cross interactions of dopamine receptor ligands with many other targets including G-protein coupled receptors, transporters, enzymes, and ion-channels, add to the complexity of discovering new targets for the treatment of nausea and vomiting.

We have previously shown elevated serotonin (5-HT) turnover rate in Lsamp-deficient mice. The purpose of the current study was to elucidate the role of Lsamp in serotonergic neurotransmission. Chronic (18Â days) administration of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram (10Â mg/kg) significantly increased general activity in wild-type mice in the open field and protected exploration in Lsamp(-/-) mice in the elevated-plus maze. An important psychopathology-related endophenotype, elevated 5-HT turnover in the brain of Lsamp-deficient mice, was reproduced in the saline group. Escitalopram restored the elevated 5-HT turnover of Lsamp-deficient mice to a level comparable with their wild-type littermates, suggesting that high 5-HT turnover in mutants is mediated by the increased activity of serotonin transporter (SERT protein encoded by Slc6a4 gene). The baseline level of Slc6a4 transcript was not changed in Lsamp-deficient mice, however, our immunohistochemical analysis showed partial co-expression of Lsamp with both SERT and Tph2 proteins in raphe. Overactivity of SERT in Lsamp(-/-) mice is further supported by significant elevation of Maoa transcript and increase of DOPAC, another Mao A product, specifically in the raphe. Again, elevation of DOPAC was reduced to the level of wild-type by chronic SSRI treatment. The activity of Lsamp gene promoters varied in 5-HT producing nuclei: both Lsamp 1a and 1b promoters were active in the dorsal raphe; most of the expression in the median raphe was from 1b promoter, whereas Lsamp 1a promoter was almost exclusively active in the caudal subgroup of raphe nuclei. We suggest that Lsamp may have an impact on the integrity of serotonergic synapses, which is possibly the neurochemical basis of the anxiety- and sociability-related phenotype in Lsamp-deficient mice.",,United States,2020,10.1016/j.pbb.2020.173017,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Escitalopram and Limbic system associated protein and Raphe and Serotonin and Serotonin transporter and Tryptophan hydroxylase,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32828972

Accordingly, we investigated the possible rewarding and reinforcing effects of 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB through conditioned place preference (CPP), self-administration, and locomotor sensitization tests. We also determined the possible influence of 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB administration on dopamine- and plasticity-related proteins in the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area. 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB induced CPP at different doses and were self-administered by rats. Only 5-EAPB induced locomotor sensitization in mice. 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB did not alter the expressions of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, nor changed tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expressions in the ventral tegmental area. Both 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB enhanced deltaFosB, but not transcription factor cyclic AMP-response-element binding protein and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the nucleus accumbens. Hence, the potential rewarding and reinforcing effects on rodents induced by 2-EAPB and 5-EAPB may possibly be associated with alterations in other neurotransmitter systems (besides mesolimbic) and/or neuro-plastic modifications.",,Netherlands,2020,10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173527,Journal Article,2-EAPB and 5-EAPB and Abuse potential and Conditioned place preference and Locomotor sensitization and Self-administration,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32871174

DA modulates important physiologic functions and perturbations in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and, its signaling have been associated with alterations in behavioral, molecular, and morphologic properties in C. elegans. Here, we evaluated the possible involvement of dopaminergic receptors in the onset of these alterations followed by haloperidol exposure. Haloperidol increased lifespan and decreased locomotor behavior (basal slowing response, BSR, and locomotion speed via forward speed) of the worms. Moreover, locomotion speed recovered to basal conditions upon haloperidol withdrawal. Haloperidol also decreased DA levels, but it did not alter neitherÂ dop-1, dop-2, and dop-3 gene expression, nor CEP dopaminergic neurons' morphology. These effects are likely due to haloperidol's antagonism of the D2-type DA receptor, dop-3. Furthermore, this antagonism appears to affect mechanistic pathways involved in the modulation and signaling of neurotransmitters such as octopamine, acetylcholine, and GABA, which may underlie at least in part haloperidol's effects. These pathways are conserved in vertebrates and have been implicated in a range of disorders. Our novel findings demonstrate that the dop-3 receptor plays an important role in the effects of haloperidol.",,United States,2021,10.1007/s12035-020-02124-9,Journal Article,Basal slowing response and Dopamine signaling and Lifespan and Locomotor behavior and Neurotransmitter and Worm,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-32935232

In the present study, we provide preclinical and clinical evidences for this latter mechanism. Two animal models for the study of schizophrenia endophenotypes, namely the phencyclidine (PCP) mouse model and the A(2A)R knockout mice, were used to establish correlations between behavioural and molecular studies.

Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system and has a crucial role in pruriceptive processing in the spinal dorsal horn. It is well known that glutamate exerts its effects by binding to various glutamate receptors including Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, and that AMPA/kainate receptors play a crucial role in pruriceptive processing; however, the precise role of AMPA receptors remains uncertain. Perampanel, an antiepileptic drug, is an antagonist of AMPA receptors. Pretreatment with perampanel dose-dependently attenuated the induction of scratching, a behavior typically associated with pruritus, by intradermal administration of the pruritogen chloroquine. In addition, the induction of scratching in mice painted with diphenylcyclopropenone and NC/Nga mice treated with Biostir AD, animal models of contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis, respectively, was dose-dependently alleviated by administration of perampanel.

Its growing acceptance and legalization have markedly increased the risks of child psychopathology, including psychotic-like experiences, which lowers the age of onset for a first psychotic episode. As the majority of patients with schizophrenia go through a premorbid condition long before this occurs, understanding neurobiological underpinnings of the prodromal stage of the disease is critical to improving illness trajectories and therapeutic outcomes. We have previously shown that male rat offspring prenatally exposed to Î”(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a rat model of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), exhibit extensive molecular and synaptic changes in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), converging on a hyperdopaminergic state. This leads to a silent psychotic-like endophenotype that is unmasked by a single exposure to THC. Here, we further characterized the VTA dopamine neuron and sensorimotor gating functions of PCE rats exposed to acute stress or a challenge of the D2 receptor agonist apomorphine, by using in vivo single-unit extracellular recordings and Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) analyses. At pre-puberty, PCE male rat offspring display a reduced population activity of VTA dopamine neurons in vivo, the majority of which are tonically active. PCE male progeny also exhibit enhanced sensitivity to dopamine D2 (DAD2) receptor activation and a vulnerability to acute stress, which is associated with compromised sensorimotor gating functions. This data extends our knowledge of the multifaceted sequelae imposed by PCE in the mesolimbic dopamine system of male pre-adolescent rats, which renders a neural substrate highly susceptible to subsequent challenges that may trigger psychotic-like outcomes.",,England,2021,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110128,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Cannabis and Dopamine and Dopamine D2 receptor and Neurodevelopment and Neuropsychiatric disorders and Stress and Vulnerability,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33031862

Such dyskinesia is associated with aberrant gene regulation in neurons of the striatum, which is caused by abnormal dopamine release from serotonin terminals. Previous work showed that modulating the striatal serotonin innervation with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or 5-HT1A receptor agonists could attenuate L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. We investigated the effects of a novel serotonergic agent, vilazodone, which combines SSRI and 5-HT1A partial agonist properties, on L-DOPA-induced behavior and gene regulation in the striatum in an animal model of Parkinson's disease. After unilateral dopamine depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), rats received repeated L-DOPA treatment (5 mg/kg) alone or in combination with vilazodone (10 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. Gene regulation was then mapped throughout the striatum using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Vilazodone suppressed the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia and turning behavior but did not interfere with the prokinetic effects of L-DOPA (forelimb stepping). L-DOPA treatment drastically increased the expression of dynorphin (direct pathway), 5-HT1B, and zif268 mRNA in the striatum ipsilateral to the lesion. These effects were inhibited by vilazodone. In contrast, vilazodone had no effect on enkephalin expression (indirect pathway) or on gene expression in the intact striatum. Thus, vilazodone inhibited L-DOPA-induced gene regulation selectively in the direct pathway of the dopamine-depleted striatum, molecular changes that are considered critical for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. These findings position vilazodone, an approved antidepressant, as a potential adjunct medication for the treatment of L-DOPA-induced motor side effects.",,Switzerland,2020,10.3390/cells9102265,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",L-DOPA and Parkinson<e2><80><99>s disease and antidepressant and dopamine and gene expression and serotonin and striatum,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33050305

In this study, we investigated the effects of psilocybin on FC across the entire brain with a view to investigate underlying mechanisms. Psilocybin effects were investigated in lightly-anaesthetized mice using resting-state fMRI. Dual-regression analysis identified reduced FC within the ventral striatum in psilocybin- relative to vehicle-treated mice. Refinement of the analysis using spatial references derived from both gene expression maps and viral tracer projection fields revealed two distinct effects of psilocybin: it increased FC between 5-HT-associated networks and cortical areas, including elements of the murine DMN, thalamus, and midbrain; it decreased FC within dopamine (DA)-associated striatal networks. These results suggest that interactions between 5-HT- and DA-regulated neural networks contribute to the neural and therefore psychological effects of psilocybin.

Most current antidepressants are associated with significant limitations, and in particular, a delayed onset and low rate of efficacy. Consequently, there remains an ongoing need for antidepressants that are either more effective or better tolerated than existing standards. We previously identified ZY-1408 as a drug with a novel chemical structure and potential anti-depressant-like activity. Specifically, ZY-1408 is a novel serotonin 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor antagonist and serotonin/norepinephrine (5-HT/NE) reuptake inhibitor. In this study, we further investigated the antidepressant-like efficacy of ZY-1408 using in vitro and in vivo behavioral tests. ZY-1408 showed 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist and 5-HT/NE reuptake inhibitor properties in vitro. Meanwhile, ZY-1408 decreased immobility in vivo in a dose-dependent manner in rats (via the forced-swim test) and mice (via the tail-suspension test). The behavioral test results do not appear to result from stimulation of locomotor activity. In chronically stressed rats, repeated ZY-1408 treatment significantly reversed depressive-like behavior, including reduced sucrose preference, decreased locomotor activity, and prolonged time to begin eating. Furthermore, in vivo microdialysis showed that administration of ZY-1408 significantly increased extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and NE in the hippocampus of freely moving rats.

Heart and circulatory physiology,,"Heart failure (HF) is associated with neurohumoral activation, which in turn leads to an increased peripheral resistance. In mesenteric vasculature, perivascular innervation plays relevant role maintaining vascular tonus and resistance. Therefore, we aimed to determine the possible alterations in superior mesenteric artery (SMA) perivascular innervation function in HF rats. HF was induced by coronary artery occlusion in male Wistar rats, and sham-operated (SO) rats were used as controls. After 12â€‰wk, a greater vasoconstrictor response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) was observed in endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded SMA of HF rats. Alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine diminished this response in a higher magnitude in HF than in SO animals. However, the noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor desipramine increased EFS-induced vasoconstriction more in segments from HF rats. Besides, EFS-induced NA release was greater in HF animals, due to a higher tyrosine hydroxylase expression and activity. P2 purinoceptor antagonist suramin reduced EFS-induced vasoconstriction only in segments from SO rats, and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) release was lower in HF than in SO. Moreover, nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor N(Ï‰)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) enhanced EFS-induced vasoconstriction in a similar extent in both groups. HF was not associated with changes in EFS-induced NO release or the vasodilator response to NO donor sodium nitroprusside. In conclusion, HF postmyocardial infarction enhanced noradrenergic function and diminished purinergic cotransmission in SMA and did not change nitrergic innervation. The net effect was an increased sympathetic participation on the EFS-induced vasoconstriction that could help to understand the neurotransduction involved on the control of vascular tonus in HF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study reinforces the pivotal role of noradrenergic innervation in the regulation of mesenteric vascular tone in a rat model of heart failure.

Signalling between oxytocin (OT) and 5-HT has been demonstrated during neurodevelopment and in the regulation of specific emotion-based behaviours. It is suggested that crosstalk between neurotransmitters is driven by interaction between their specific receptors, particularly the oxytocin receptor (OTR) and the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor (5-HTR(2C)), but evidence for this and the downstream signalling consequences that follow are lacking. Considering the overlapping central expression profiles and shared involvement of OTR and 5-HTR(2C) in certain endocrine functions and behaviours, including eating behaviour, social interaction and locomotor activity, we investigated the existence of functionally active OTR/5-HTR(2C) heterocomplexes. Here, we demonstrate evidence for a potential physical interaction between OTR and 5-HTR(2C)in vitro in a cellular expression system using flow cytometry-based FRET (fcFRET). We could recapitulate this finding under endogenous expression levels of both receptors via in silico analysis of single cell transcriptomic data and ex vivo proximity ligation assay (PLA). Next, we show that co-expression of the OTR/5-HTR(2C) pair resulted in a significant depletion of OTR-mediated GÎ±q-signalling and significant changes in receptor trafficking. Of note, attenuation of OTR-mediated downstream signalling was restored following pharmacological blockade of the 5-HTR(2C). Finally, we demonstrated a functional relevance of this novel heterocomplex, in vivo, as 5-HTR(2C) antagonism increased OT-mediated hypoactivity in mice. Overall, we provide compelling evidence for the formation of functionally active OTR/5-HTR(2C) heterocomplexes, adding another level of complexity to OTR and 5-HTR(2C) signalling functionality.

From our studies, low-intensity exercise training (LET) based on physiological indices, such as lactate threshold, easily translates to humans and positively affects the brains. Hence, LET during adolescence may ameliorate abnormalities in neurodevelopment and prevent the development of schizophrenia. In the current study, LET prevented sensitization to phencyclidine (PCP) treatment, impairment of cognition, and affective behavioral abnormalities in an animal model of schizophrenia induced by prenatal PCP treatment. Further, LET increased dopamine turnover and attenuated the impairment of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 after exposure to a novel object in the prenatal PCP-treated mice.

In this regard, we have previously shown that the piperazine derivative 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-((4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)phenol (LQFM212) has anxiolytic-like activity which involves serotonergic pathway, nicotinic receptors and BZD-site of GABA(A) receptor, without cognitive impairments. Herein, was evaluated the potential antidepressant-like effect of LQFM212 on forced swimming test (FST) after a single dose of 54 Î¼mol/kg and after repeated treatment for 15 days in mice. Pretreatment with WAY-100635, PCPA, prazosin, SCH-23390, sulpiride or AMPT reversed the antidepressant-like effect on FST, suggesting that monoaminergic pathway contributes for effects of LQFM212. Furthermore, repeated treatment with LQFM212 increased hippocampal BDNF levels dosed by ELISA kit. In assessment of possible adverse effects, repeated treatment with LQFM212 did not alter the body weight of the animals, glutathione levels in the liver, and serum levels of AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine. Taken together, the results showed that LQFM212 has an antidepressant-like effect that involves monoaminergic pathway and increased BDNF levels.

The sites have been distinguished and characterized in [3H]ketanserin binding assays by selective inhibition with tetrabenazine (Ki = 4 nM), a monoamine depleting agent. In rats, the nonserotonergic ketanserin sites were enriched in the striatum (KD = 12.4 +/- 0.3 nM, maximal number of binding sites = 53.2 +/- 11.8 fmol/mg of tissue at pH 7.7, 37 degrees C) and nucleus accumbens. The sites were decreased by 65 to 78% after 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, suggesting an association with dopaminergic nerve terminals. In in vitro superfusion experiments using [3H]dopamine, [3H]norepinephrine and [3H]serotonin loaded rat brain tissue and [3H]serotonin loaded human platelets, 5 min superfusion with 10(-6) M ketanserin, tetrabenazine and reserpine caused instantaneously a marked increase in tritium efflux. The effect was attenuated by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline, in brain slices but not in platelets. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of endogenous catecholamines, serotonin and metabolites in superfusates from striatal slices revealed that stimulation with these drugs provoked mainly release of 3,4-dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Potencies of a series of ketanserin derivatives, benzoquinolizine derivatives and a variety of drugs affecting neurotransmission were assessed in the in vitro release test using [3H]dopamine loaded striatal slices, and in [3H]ketanserin binding assays to nonserotonergic sites in the striatum and to serotonin-S2 receptors in brain tissue. Activities of drugs in the release test correlated strongly with their binding affinities for nonserotonergic ketanserin sites (rs = 0.83, n = 30, P less than .001). High potency in the latter two tests was confined to few close structural congeners of ketanserin and tetrabenazine. Distinct structural activity relationships for interaction with nonserotonergic ketanserin sites and serotonin-S2 receptors were found. It was concluded that nonserotonergic ketanserin sites mediate release of oxidated metabolites of biogenic amines from nerve endings and of serotonin from platelets. Hence release of biogenic amine metabolites or of cytoplasmic amines is probably not a mere diffusion process but involves specific membranous molecules. Unlike tetrabenazine, ketanserin caused no obvious depletion of central catecholamine and indoleamine stores.

It has been suggested that HSDD is associated with an imbalance of hormone and neurotransmitter levels in the brain, resulting in decreased excitation, increased inhibition, or a combination of both. Evidence suggests neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), norepinephrine, and serotonin, as well as hormones such as estradiol and testosterone, contribute to female sexual desire and response. Current treatments for HSDD include psychotherapy, and two US Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for premenopausal women: flibanserin, a serotonin mixed agonist and antagonist, and bremelanotide, a melanocortin receptor (MCR) agonist. Melanocortins are endogenous neuropeptides associated with the excitatory pathway of the female sexual response system. MCRs are found throughout the body, including the brain. Bremelanotide is an MCR agonist that nonselectively activates several of the receptor subtypes, of which subtype 4 (MC4R) is the most relevant at therapeutic doses. MC4R is predominantly expressed in the medial preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus in the brain, and is important for female sexual function. Animal studies suggest that bremelanotide may affect female sexual desire by activating presynaptic MC4Rs on neurons in the mPOA of the hypothalamus, leading to increased release of DA, an excitatory neurotransmitter that increases sexual desire.

MTZ is reportedly associated with an increased risk of bleeding. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the antiplatelet effect of MTZ in mice via light transmission aggregometry to elucidate the mechanism of MTZ-induced bleeding. The results of the ex vivo study showed that the oral administration of MTZ (20 or 100â€‰mg/kg) significantly suppressed platelet aggregation mediated by the synergic interaction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and adrenaline. Additionally, MTZ significantly suppressed platelet aggregation, mediated by the synergic interaction of ADP and 5-HT or adrenaline. Similar results were obtained in vitro, under the condition of 5-HT- and adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation. Overall, the results suggest that MTZ exerts antiplatelet effect by co-blocking 5-HT(2A) and Î±(2)-adrenergic receptors on platelets and suppresses platelet aggregation mediated by ADP, increased by either 5-HT or adrenaline.

The effects of ORM-10921 were compared to the non-selective Î±(2)-AR antagonist, idazoxan (IDAZ; 3Â mg/kg/d), and to imipramine (IMI; 15Â mg/kg/d), a reference antidepressant in this model. FSL rats displayed significantly reduced 5-HT (pÂ =Â 0.03) and DA (pÂ =Â 0.02) levels vs. FRL controls, while NA levels showed a similar trend. ORM-10921 significantly increased NA (all doses pÂ â‰¤Â 0.02), 5-HT (0.1 and 0.3Â mg/kg pÂ â‰¤Â 0.03) and DA levels (all doses pÂ â‰¤Â 0.03), which correlated with decreased monoamine turnover.

Moreover, the serotonergic system modulates the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a structure involved in reward encoding, and reward prediction error. However, the role played by 5-HT on BLA during a reward-driven task has not been fully elucidated. In this paper, we investigated whether serotonergic modulation of the BLA is involved in reward-driven learning. To this end, we trained Long Evans rats in an operant conditioning task, and examined the effects of fluoxetine treatment (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, 10 mg/kg) in combination with BLA lesions with NMDA (20 mg/mL) on extinction learning. We also investigated whether intra-BLA injection of the serotonergic 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH DPAT, or antagonist WAY-100635, alters extinction performance. We found that fluoxetine treatment strongly accelerated extinction learning, while BLA lesions partially reverted this effect and slightly impaired consolidation of extinction. Stimulation and inhibition of 5-HT(1A) receptors in BLA induced opposite effects to those of fluoxetine, impairing or accelerating extinction performance, respectively. Our findings suggest that 5-HT modulates reward-driven learning, and 5-HT(1A) receptors located in the BLA are relevant for extinction.",,Netherlands,2021,10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113161,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT(1A) and Basolateral amygdala and Extinction and Fluoxetine and Operant conditioning and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33571570

Recently, we reported that the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) works in concert with the ventral hippocampus to regulate dopamine system function; however, the PVT has yet to be investigated as target for the treatment of the disease. Given the dense expression of orexin receptors in the thalamus, we believe these to be a possible target for pharmacological regulation of PVT activity. METHODS: Here we used the methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) rodent model, which displays pathological alterations consistent with schizophrenia to determine whether orexin receptor blockade can restore ventral tegmental area dopamine system function. We measured dopamine neuron population activity, using in vivo electrophysiology, following administration of the dual orexin antagonist, TCS 1102 (both intraperitoneal and intracranial into the PVT in MAM- and saline-treated rats), and orexin A and B peptides (intracranial into the PVT in naÃ¯ve rats). RESULTS: Aberrant dopamine system function in MAM-treated rats was normalized by the systemic administration of TCS 1102. To investigate the potential site of action, the orexin peptides A and B were administered directly into the PVT, where they significantly increased ventral tegmental area dopamine neuron population activity in control rats. In addition, the direct administration of TCS 1102 into the PVT reproduced the beneficial effects seen with the systemic administration in MAM-treated rats.

It is part of the benzodiazepine family, substances known to primarily act by binding and enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptors. The objective of the present work was to investigate the influence of short and medium-term diazepam exposures on neurotransmitters measured through targeted metabolomics using a zebrafish embryo model. METHODS: Short-term (2.5Â h) and medium-term (96Â h) exposures to diazepam were performed at drug concentrations of 0.8, 1.6, 16, and 160Â Î¼g/L. Intervention groups were compared with a vehicle control group. Each group consisted of 20 zebrafish eggs/larvae. Metabolites related with neurotransmission were determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). RESULTS: Thirty-six compounds were quantified. Significantly increased tryptophan and serotonin concentrations were found in the intervention groups receiving higher doses of diazepam in 2.5Â h exposure (pÂ <Â 0.05 control versus intervention groups). Tyrosine concentrations were higher (pÂ <Â 0.05) at higher concentrations in 2.5Â h exposure, but lower (pÂ <Â 0.05) at higher concentrations in 96Â h exposure. Both phenylalanine and aspartic acid concentrations were higher (pÂ <Â 0.05) at higher doses in 2.5Â h and 96Â h exposure.

In contrast, the equivalent dose of a deuterated analog (alpha, alpha, beta, beta-tetradeutero-PLZ, d4PLZ) elicits a biphasic behavioral syndrome in rats. In an attempt to correlate changes in cerebral monoamines with behavior, the concentration of various amines were measured at various times after the administration of either d4PLZ or PLZ (25 mg/kg). In general, PLZ and d4PLZ caused elevations in brain amine levels, particularly in the time period 2-12 hours after drug administration. Furthermore, d4PLZ increased the concentrations of serotonin (5-HT), phenylethylamine (PE), tryptamine (T), meta-tyramine (mTA), and 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT) to a greater extent than PLZ. Since the time course of behavioral excitation closely parallels the elevations in T and PE levels in the brain and since the percentage increases in PE and T levels following d4PLZ compared to PLZ treatment were substantially greater than those of the other amines, it was postulated that PE and T are involved in d4PLZ-induced behaviors.",,United States,1988,10.1007/BF00973322,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3362290

Most of the associated symptoms are related to the deficiency of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) stores. A deficiency of 5-HT can modulate dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum to elicit hyperactivity and psychosis in AN patients. Also, the release and availability of 5-HT are modulated by serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) auto-receptor. The present study investigates the role of striatal metabolism of 5-HT and dopamine in precipitating hyperactivity in the rat model of diet restriction (DR) induced AN. The role of tryptophan (Trp) in influencing the 5-HT metabolism and the mRNA expression of 5-HT1A auto-receptor is also investigated. We find that long-term DR for 38 days reduces body-weight in rats and produces hyperactivity, similar to AN. This hyperactivity is characterized by declined striatal metabolism of both, dopamine and 5-HT. The mRNA expression of 5-HT1A auto-receptor in the raphe nuclei is also decreased. Trp co-treatment improves these deficiencies in monoamine metabolism and alleviates hyperactivity. Interestingly, DR-induced changes in body-weights are not effected by Trp co-treatment. The study suggests that the striatal metabolism of 5-HT and dopamine and mRNA expression of 5-HT1A auto-receptor has an important role in the pathogenesis of AN. The finding suggests that co-use of Trp can prevent precipitation of AN by normalizing 5-HT metabolism.",,England,2022,10.1080/1028415X.2021.1901046,Journal Article,Anorexia nervosa and diet restriction and dopamine and hyperactivity and serotonin and serptonin-1A autoreceptor and striatum and tryptophan,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33722185

Because of the modulatory role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on the serotonin system and the effects of METH, we included both BDNF heterozygous (HET) mice and wildtype (WT) controls. Male and female mice of both genotypes were treated with an escalating METH dose regimen from the age of 6-9Â weeks. At least two weeks later, acute locomotor hyperactivity induced by a 5Â mg/kg D-amphetamine challenge was significantly enhanced in METH-pretreated mice, showing long-term sensitisation. METH pretreatment caused a small, but significant decrease of 5-HT(1A) receptor binding in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of males independent of genotype, but there were no changes in the median raphe nucleus (MRN) or in SERT binding density. METH treatment reduced the number of TPH2 positive cells in ventral subregions of the rostral and medial DRN independent of genotype. METH treatment selectively reduced DRN cell counts in BDNF HET mice compared to wildtype mice in medial and caudal ventrolateral subregions previously associated with panic-like behaviour.

A genome-wide association study identified links between PDZK1 polymorphisms and altered visual contrast sensitivity, an endophenotype for schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. The PDZK1 protein is implicated in neurological functioning, interacting with synaptic molecules including postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95), N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 (CRFR1), and serotonin 2A receptors. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the role of PDZK1. METHODS: We generated pdzk1-knockout (pdzk1-KO) zebrafish using CRISPR/Cas-9 genome editing. Visual function of 7-day-old fish was assessed at behavioral and functional levels using the optomotor response and scotopic electroretinogram (ERG). We also quantified retinal morphology and densities of PSD-95, NMDAR1, CRFR1, and serotonin in the synaptic inner plexiform layer at 7 days, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of age. Standard RT-PCR and nonsense-mediated decay interference treatment were also performed to assess genetic compensation in mutants. RESULTS: Relative to wild-type, pdzk1-KO larvae showed spatial frequency tuning functions with increased amplitude (likely due to abnormal gain control) and reduced ERG b-waves (suggestive of inner retinal dysfunction).

Agarwood smoke has been used in traditional medicine as a sedative anti-anxious, and anti-restless therapy. Its scent emitted from heat induces people to enter a stable state; however, the underlying molecular effect is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study analyzed novel biological events and gene expression signatures induced by agarwood incense smoke in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Incense smoke was produced by heating at 150Â Â°C for 30Â min in a headspace autosampler oven. We treated mice with exposure to incense smoke from Kynam agarwood for 45Â min/day for 7 consecutive days. After a 7-day inhalation period, the potent agarwood smoke affected-indicators in serum were measured, and the RNA profiles of the mouse brains were analyzed by microarray to elucidate the biological events induced by agarwood incense smoke. RESULTS: Chemical profile analysis showed that the major component in the incense smoke of Kynam was 2-(2-phenylethyl) chromone (26.82%). Incense smoke from Kynam induced mice to enter a stable state and increased the levels of serotonin in sera. The emotion-related pathways, including dopaminergic synapse, serotonergic synapse, GABAergic synapse, long-term depression and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, were significantly affected by incense smoke. Moreover, the expression of Crhr2 and Chrnd genes, involved with neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, was upregulated by incense smoke. CONCLUSIONS: By a newly-established incense smoke exposure system, we first identified that anti-anxious and anti-depressant effects of agarwood incense smoke were likely associated with the increase of serotonin levels and multiple neuroactive pathways in mice.",,Ireland,2021,10.1016/j.jep.2021.114069,Journal Article,Agarwood and Gene expression profile and Incense smoke and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33794334

CTA is a learning paradigm in which a novel taste stimulus (CS) is associated with gastric malaise (US), inducing aversion to the CS in future encounters. The role of the IC in CTA memory formation has been extensively studied. However, the functional significance of neurotransmitter release during the presentation of taste stimuli and gastric malaise-inducing agents remains unclear. Using microdialysis in free-moving animals, we evaluated simultaneous changes in glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine release in response to the presentation of an innate appetitive or aversive gustatory novel stimulus, as well as after i.p. administration of isotonic or hypertonic gastric malaise-inducing solutions. Our results demonstrate that the presentation of novel stimuli, regardless of their innate valence, induces an elevation of norepinephrine and dopamine. Administration of a gastric malaise inducing agent (LiCl) promotes an elevation of glutamate regardless of its concentration. In comparison, norepinephrine release is related to the LiCl concentration and its equimolar NaCl control. Additionally, we evaluated their functional role on short and long-term taste aversion memory. Results indicate that the blockade of noradrenergic Î²1,2 receptors in the IC spares CTA acquisition and memory consolidation. In contrast, blockade of dopamine D1/D5 receptors impaired CTA consolidation, whereas the NMDA receptor blockade impedes both acquisition and consolidation of CTA. These results suggest that dopaminergic and noradrenergic release are related to the salience of conditioned taste stimuli. However, only cortical D1/D5 dopaminergic activity, but not the noradrenergic Î²1,2 activity, is involved in the acquisition and consolidation of taste memory formation. Additionally, glutamatergic activity signals visceral distress caused by LiCl administration and activates NMDA receptors necessary for the acquisition and consolidation of long-lasting taste aversion memory.",,United States,2021,10.1016/j.nlm.2021.107437,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Consolidation and Dopamine and Glutamate and Interoception and Norepinephrine and Novelty and Taste aversion,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33831511

JWH-018 has cannabinoid CB(1) receptor-dependent reinforcing properties and acutely increases dopaminergic transmission selectively in the NAc shell. Here, we tested the hypothesis that repeated administration of JWH-018 (i) modulates behaviour, (ii) affects dopaminergic transmission and its responsiveness to motivational stimuli, and (iii) is associated with a neuroinflammatory phenotype. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Rats were administered with JWH-018 once a day for 14 consecutive days. We then performed behavioural, electrophysiological, and neurochemical evaluation at multiple time points after drug discontinuation. KEY RESULTS: Repeated JWH-018 exposure (i) induced anxious and aversive behaviours, transitory attentional deficits, and withdrawal signs; (ii) decreased spontaneous activity and number of dopamine neurons in the VTA; and (iii) reduced stimulation of dopaminergic transmission in the NAc shell while potentiating that in the NAc core, in response to acute JWH-018 challenge. Moreover, (iv) we observed a decreased dopamine sensitivity in the NAc shell and core, but not in the mPFC, to a first chocolate exposure; conversely, after a second exposure, dialysate dopamine fully increased in the NAc shell and core but not in the mPFC. Finally, selected dopamine brain areas showed (v) astrogliosis (mPFC, NAc shell and core, VTA), microgliosis (NAc shell and core), and downregulation of CB(1) receptors (mPFC, NAc shell and core).

In addition to canonical pathway, D2-receptor (D2R) exerts some of its biological actions through regulating the activity of Akt and GSK3, which in turn were found to be altered in several psychiatric illnesses. The present study examined the impacts of maternal separation, an early-life stress model which has been associated with disturbed neurodevelopment and appearance of many psychiatric disorders, on developmental changes in dopamine concentration and the expression of D2Rs, Akt and GSK-3Î² in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC; a key target of stress) in adolescent and young adult male rats. METHODS: Maternal separation was performed 3 h per day from postnatal days 2 to 11. The PFC protein and dopamine contents were determined using western blotting analysis and Eliza, respectively. RESULTS: Results indicated long-term increases in the prefrontal dopamine levels in stressed adolescent and young adult male rats, accompanied by significant downregulation of D2R as well as upregulation of p-Akt and GSK-3Î² contents in stressed adolescence compared to controls, with all protein levels that returned to control values in stressed adult rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that early-life stress differentially modulates prefrontal D2R/Akt/GSK-3Î² levels during development. Since adolescence period is susceptible to the onset of specific mental illnesses, disruption of noncanonical components of D2R signaling during this critical period may have an important role in programming neurobehavioral phenotypes in adulthood and manipulations influencing Akt/GSK-3Î² pathway may improve the expression of specific dopamine-related behaviors and the effects of dopaminergic drugs.",,Germany,2022,10.1515/jcim-2020-0539,Journal Article,D2-receptor and GSK-3<ce><b2> and adolescence and dopamine and early-life stress and prefrontal cortex and rat,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-33962496

Such limitations might stem from the insufficient enhancement of plasticity mechanisms, crucial for functional recovery. Here, we designed a clinically relevant strategy that combines robotic rehabilitation with chemogenetic stimulation of serotonin release to boost plasticity. These two approaches acted synergistically to enhance post-stroke motor performance. Indeed, mice treated with our combined therapy showed substantial functional gains that persisted beyond the treatment period and generalized to non-trained tasks. Motor recovery was associated with a reduction in electrophysiological and neuroanatomical markers of GABAergic neurotransmission, suggesting disinhibition in perilesional areas. To unveil the translational potentialities of our approach, we specifically targeted the serotonin 1A receptor by delivering Buspirone, a clinically approved drug, in stroke mice undergoing robotic rehabilitation.

The nuclear transcription factor Nurr1, essential for DA neuron (DAN) development, survival, and maintenance, is also known to interact with circadian rhythm regulating clock proteins. In the Nurr1-null heterozygous (+/-) mice, a Nurr1 deficient model which reproduces some of the alterations in DA function found in schizophrenia and PD, we measured, using wheel-running activity, the free running period (tau) and photoperiod entrainment. Because Nurr1 has a role in regulating the DA phenotype, we also measured the circadian fluctuations in the number of DANs using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunofluorescence. In Nurr1 +/- mice, tau was significantly shorter and entrainment to a 6 h earlier shift in the dark cycle was accelerated. The Nurr1 wild-type (+/+) mice cycled DAN numbers across time, with a significantly greater number (âˆ¼2-fold increase) of DANs at zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 than ZT12. The +/- mice, however, did not cycle the DA phenotype, as no differences in DAN numbers were observed between ZT0 and ZT12. Additionally, the +/- mice had significantly fewer DANs at ZT0 but not at ZT12 as compared to +/+ mice.

Due to increasing CO(2) concentrations in the ocean, pH levels are expected to drop by 0.4 units by the end of the century. There is an urgent need to understand the impact of ocean acidification on chemical-ecological processes. To date, the extent and mechanisms by which the decreasing ocean pH influences chemical communication are unclear. Combining behaviour assays with computational chemistry, we explore the function of the predator related cue 2-phenylethylamine (PEA) for hermit crabs (Pagurus bernhardus) in current and end-of-the-century oceanic pH. Living in intertidal environments, hermit crabs face large pH fluctuations in their current habitat in addition to climate-change related ocean acidification. We demonstrate that the dietary predator cue PEA for mammals and sea lampreys is an attractant for hermit crabs, with the potency of the cue increasing with decreasing pH levels. In order to explain this increased potency, we assess changes to PEA's conformational and charge-related properties as one potential mechanistic pathway. Using quantum chemical calculations validated by NMR spectroscopy, we characterise the different protonation states of PEA in water. We show how protonation of PEA could affect receptor-ligand binding, using a possible model receptor for PEA (human TAAR1).

By means of in vivo microdialysis, dopamine release induced by local administration of amphetamine was monitored in nAc and DMS of amphetamine naÃ¯ve rats, and in rats subjected to five days of systemic amphetamine administration (2.0Â mg/kg/day) followed by two weeks of withdrawal. In parallel, ex vivo electrophysiology was conducted to outline the effect of acute and repeated amphetamine exposure on striatal neurotransmission. The data shows that amphetamine increases dopamine in a concentration-dependent and subregion-specific manner. Furthermore, repeated administration of amphetamine followed by abstinence resulted in a selective decrease in baseline dopamine in the nAc, and a potentiation of the relative dopamine elevation after systemic amphetamine in the same area. Ex vivo electrophysiology demonstrated decreased excitatory neurotransmission in brain slices from amphetamine-treated animals, and a nAc selective shift in the responsiveness to the dopamine D2-receptor agonist quinpirole.

Electrophysiological data also indicated that SR58611A (1â€‰mg/kg) selectively enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) through interacting with norepinephrine (NE) system and activating Î²3-AR, whereas higher dosage of SR58611A (20â€‰mg/kg) reduced both AMPA receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated EPSC. SR58611A-induced different effects on EPSC linked with the change of the surface expression quantity of NMDA receptor and/or AMPA receptor subunits. Synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25), which is a key soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein involved in incorporation of NMDA receptor to postsynaptic membrane, contributed to SR58611A (1â€‰mg/kg)-induced enhancement of recognition memory and NMDA receptor function. Moreover, SR58611A (1â€‰mg/kg) could rescue repeated stress-induced defect of both recognition memory and NMDA receptor function through a SNAP-25-dependent mechanism. These results provide a potential mechanism underlying the cognitive-enhancing effects of SR58611A (1â€‰mg/kg).",,Netherlands,2021,10.1016/j.bbr.2021.113417,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Behaviors and Glutamate receptor and Prefrontal cortex and Rat and <ce><b2>3-adrenoceptor,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34157371

Na2S2O3 mediated neuro- and cardioprotective effects in ischemia/reperfusion models and anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced acute lung injury. Moreover, Na2S2O3 improved lung function during resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in swine with pre-existing atherosclerosis, characterized by decreased expression of cystathionine Î³-lyase (CSE), a major source of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) synthesis in the vasculature. Based on these findings, we investigated the effects of Na2S2O3 administration during resuscitation from trauma-and-hemorrhage in mice under conditions of whole body CSE deficit. METHODS: After blast wave-induced blunt chest trauma and surgical instrumentation, CSE knockout (CSE-/-) mice underwent 1 h of hemorrhagic shock (MAP 35â€ŠÂ±â€Š5 mm Hg). At the beginning of resuscitation comprising retransfusion, norepinephrine support and lung-protective mechanical ventilation, animals received either i.v. Na2S2O3 (0.45â€Šmgâ€Šg-1, nâ€Š=â€Š12) or vehicle (saline, nâ€Š=â€Š13). Hemodynamics, acid-base status, metabolism using stable isotopes, and visceral organ function were assessed. Blood and organs were collected for analysis of cytokines, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Na2S2O3 treatment improved arterial paO2 (Pâ€Š=â€Š0.03) coinciding with higher lung tissue glucocorticoid receptor expression. Norepinephrine requirements were lower in the Na2S2O3 group (Pâ€Š<â€Š0.05), which was associated with lower endogenous glucose production and higher urine output. Na2S2O3 significantly increased renal tissue IÎºBÎ± and heme oxygenase-1 expression, whereas it lowered kidney IL-6 and MCP-1 levels. CONCLUSION: Na2S2O3 exerted beneficial effects during resuscitation of murine trauma-and-hemorrhage in CSE-/- mice, confirming and extending the previously described organ-protective and anti-inflammatory properties of Na2S2O3. The findings make Na2S2O3 a potentially promising therapeutic option in the context of impaired CSE activity and/or reduced endogenous H2S availability.",,United States,2022,10.1097/SHK.0000000000001828,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34172609

However, relatively few studies have detailed specific brain pathways that mediate NE-associated binge-like ethanol consumption. To begin to fill this gap in the literature, male and female C57BL6/J and TH-ires-cre mice underwent pharmacological and chemogenetic testing, respectively, in combination with ""drinking in the dark"" procedures to model binge-like consumption of ethanol or sucrose solutions. First, we showed that intraperitoneal administration of the NE reuptake inhibitor, reboxetine, blunted binge-like ethanol intake in C57BL6/J mice. Chemogenetic activation of locus coeruleus (LC) tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-expressing neurons blunted binge-like ethanol intake regardless of sex. Chemogenetic activation of LC projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH), a region implicated in ethanol consumption, blunted binge-like ethanol drinking without altering sucrose intake in ethanol-experienced or ethanol-naÃ¯ve mice. In C57BL/6Â J mice, LH-targeted microinfusion of an Î±1-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist blunted binge-like ethanol intake across both sexes, while LH infusion of a Î²-AR agonist blunted binge-like ethanol intake in females exclusively. Finally, in mice with high baseline ethanol intake both an Î±1- AR agonist and an Î±-2 AR antagonist blunted binge-like ethanol intake. The present results provide novel evidence that increased NE tone in a circuit arising from the LC and projecting to the LH reduces binge-like ethanol drinking in mice, and may represent a novel approach to treating binge or heavy drinking prior to the development of dependence.

Consolidation stabilizes new memories, whereas reconsolidation restabilizes memories destabilized when reactivated during recall. However, the biological role of the destabilization/reconsolidation cycle is still unknown. It has been hypothesized that reconsolidation links new information with reactivated memories, but some reports suggest that new and old memories are associated through consolidation mechanisms instead. Object-recognition memory (ORM) serves to judge the familiarity of items and is essential for remembering previous events. We took advantage of the fact that ORM consolidation, destabilization, and reconsolidation can be pharmacologically dissociated to demonstrate that, depending on the activation state of hippocampal dopamine D1/D5 receptors, the memory of a novel object presented during recall of the memory of a familiar one can be formed via reconsolidation or consolidation, but only reconsolidation can link them. We also found that recognition memories formed through reconsolidation can be destabilized even if indirectly reactivated. Our results indicate that dopamine couples novelty detection with memory destabilization to determine whether a new recognition trace is associated with an active network and suggest that declarative reminders should be used with caution during reconsolidation-based psychotherapeutic interventions.",,United States,2021,10.1073/pnas.2025275118,Journal Article,CaMKII and PKM<ce><b6> and indirect recall and memory schemata and memory updating,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34253612

The intimate mechanism of protection remains difficult to be analyzed in vivo. In fact, this may occur directly on target neurons or as the indirect consequence of NE-induced alterations in the activity of trans-synaptic loops. Therefore, to elude neuronal networks, which may contribute to these effects in vivo, the present study investigates whether NE still protects when directly applied to Meth-treated PC12 cells. Meth was selected based on its detrimental effects along various specific brain areas. The study shows that NE directly protects in vitro against Meth-induced cell damage. The present study indicates that such an effect fully depends on the activation of plasma membrane Î²2-adrenergic receptors (ARs). Evidence indicates that Î²2-ARs activation restores autophagy, which is impaired by Meth administration. This occurs via restoration of the autophagy flux and, as assessed by ultrastructural morphometry, by preventing the dissipation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) from autophagy vacuoles to the cytosol, which is produced instead during Meth toxicity. These findings may have an impact in a variety of degenerative conditions characterized by NE deficiency along with autophagy impairment.",,Switzerland,2021,10.3390/ijms22137232,Journal Article,LC3 and PC12 and autophagy and autophagy vacuoles and cell compartmentalization and methamphetamine and norepinephrine,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34281286

Dopamine dysfunction is associated with symptoms of schizophrenia. However, whether the dopamine system is involved in MMN impairment remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole on mismatch responses to sound frequency changes in an animal model. METHODS: Event-related potentials were recorded from electrocorticogram electrodes placed on the auditory and frontal cortices of freely moving rats using a frequency oddball paradigm consisting of ascending and equiprobable (ie, many standards) control sequences before and after the subcutaneous administration of quinpirole. To detect mismatch responses, difference waveforms were obtained by subtracting nondeviant control waveforms from deviant waveforms. RESULTS: Here, we show the significant effects of quinpirole on frontal mismatch responses to sound frequency deviations in rats. Quinpirole delayed the frontal N18 and P30 mismatch responses and reduced the frontal N55 MMN-like response, which resulted from the reduction in the N55 amplitude to deviant stimuli. Importantly, the magnitude of the N55 amplitude was negatively correlated with the time of the P30 latency in the difference waveforms. In contrast, quinpirole administration did not clearly affect the temporal mismatch responses recorded from the auditory cortex. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the disruption of dopamine D2-like receptor signaling by quinpirole reduces frontal MMN to sound frequency deviations and that delays in early mismatch responses are involved in this MMN impairment.",,United States,2021,10.1002/npr2.12199,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",animal model and dopamine and middle-latency response and mismatch negativity and schizophrenia,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34296531

Notably, action and valence are not independent in motivated tasks, and it is particularly difficult for humans to learn the inhibition of an action to obtain a reward. We have previously observed that the carriers of the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA A1 allele, that has been associated with reduced striatal dopamine D2 receptor expression, showed a diminished learning performance when required to learn response inhibition to obtain rewards, a finding that was replicated in two independent cohorts. With our present study, we followed two aims: first, we aimed to replicate our finding on the DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA polymorphism in a third independent cohort (Nâ€‰=â€‰99) and to investigate the nature of the genetic effects more closely using trial-by-trial behavioral analysis and computational modeling in the combined dataset (Nâ€‰=â€‰281). Second, we aimed to assess a potentially modulatory role of prefrontal dopamine availability, using the widely studied COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism as a proxy. We first report a replication of the above mentioned finding. Interestingly, after combining all three cohorts, exploratory analyses regarding the COMT Val108/158Met polymorphism suggest that homozygotes for the Met allele, which has been linked to higher prefrontal dopaminergic tone, show a lower learning bias.

In elderly people, drug-induced and aging-associated urinary disorders are likely to occur. The most significant factor causing drug-induced urinary disorders is a decrease in urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) contraction induced by the anticholinergic action of therapeutics. However, the anticholinergic action-associated inhibitory effects of antipsychotics on UBSM contraction have not been sufficiently assessed. In this study, we examined 26 clinically available antipsychotics to determine the extent to which they inhibit acetylcholine (ACh)-induced contraction in rat UBSM to predict the drugs that should not be used by elderly people to avoid urinary disorders. Of the 26 antipsychotics, six (chlorpromazine, levomepromazine (phenothiazines), zotepine (a thiepine), olanzapine, quetiapine, clozapine (multi-acting receptor targeted antipsychotics (MARTAs))) competitively inhibited ACh-induced contractions at concentrations corresponding to clinically significant doses.

Though it most commonly presents during treatment with antipsychotic drugs which block dopamine D2 receptors, Akathisia has also been reported during treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), stimulants, mirtazapine, tetrabenazine and other drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This article was designed as a narrative review on akathisia with a focus on its clinical presentation, pathophysiology and management. A PubMed search for akathisia was conducted which returned 8481 articles. RESULTS: Akathisia is experienced as severe restlessness commonly accompanied by dysphoria and purposeless movement which relieves subjective tension. It has been attributed to an imbalance between dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia. Acute akathisia commonly resolves upon treatment discontinuation but tardive and chronic akathisia may persist after the causative agent is withdrawn and prove resistant to pharmacological treatment. Even drugs which induce no other extrapyramidal side effects (such as clozapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole and cariprazine) may induce akathisia. A high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with motor disabilities, drug-induced parkinsonism and those under mechanical restraint. Propranolol and low-dose mirtazapine are the most thoroughly studied pharmacological interventions for akathisia, though benzodiazepines, voltage-gated calcium channel blockers (gabapentin, pregabalin) and opioids may be effective. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological management may pose a challenge in chronic akathisia. Rotation between different pharmacological management strategies may be optimal in resistant cases. Discontinuation of the causative drug and use of b-blockers, mirtazapine, benzodiazepines or gabapentinoids for symptomatic relief is the basis of management.",,Italy,2021,10.26355/eurrev_202101_26386,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34337722

The actions of serotonin (5-HT) on pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus were characterized using intracellular recording in in vitro brain slices. 2. 5-HT typically evokes a biphasic response consisting of a hyperpolarization which is followed by a longer-lasting depolarization. These effects on membrane potential are accompanied by a decrease in the calcium-activated after-hyperpolarization (a.h.p). 3. Detailed analysis using 5-HT antagonists and agonists indicates that the hyperpolarization is mediated by a 5-HT1A receptor. Spiperone is the most effective antagonist of the response and the selective 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OHDPAT, behaves as a partial agonist at this receptor. In agreement with the distribution of 5-HT1A binding sites, responses to 5-HT were most prominent in the stratum radiatum. 4. The hyperpolarizing response is associated with a decrease in input resistance, is blocked by extracellular barium and intracellular caesium, is unaffected by the chloride gradient, and its reversal potential shifts with the extracellular concentration of potassium as predicted for a response mediated by a selective increase in potassium permeability. 5. The depolarizing response and reduction in the a.h.p. could be studied in isolation by blocking the hyperpolarizing response with either pertussis toxin or spiperone. The pharmacology of these responses did not correspond to that of any of the 5-HT binding sites reported in C.N.S. tissue. Although the depolarization and blockade of the a.h.p. have the same time course it is unclear if they are mediated by the same or different receptors. 6. The depolarization most likely results from a decrease in resting potassium conductance. However, neither a blockade of the M current nor the a.h.p. current can account for the depolarization. 7. Blockade of phosphodiesterase activity by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) did not enhance the depressant action of 5-HT on the a.h.p., making it unlikely that this action is mediated by cyclic AMP. 8. Blockade of the a.h.p. by 5-HT reduces spike frequency adaptation and counteracts the inhibitory action of 5-HT on 5-HT1A receptors. This excitatory action outlasts the hyperpolarizing action. 9. In summary 5-HT acts on at least two distinct receptors on hippocampal pyramidal cells, one coupled to the opening of potassium channels and a second coupled to a decrease in a resting potassium conductance and a decrease in the a.h.p.",,England,1987,10.1113/jphysiol.1987.sp016862,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3443977

However, the precise functional roles of TAAR1 to the actions of clinically used antidepressants remains unclear. Herein, we addressed these issues employing the TAAR1 agonist, o-phenyl-iodotyramine (o-PIT), together with TAAR1-knockout (KO) mice. Irrespective of genotype, systemic administration of o-PIT led to a similar increase in mouse brain concentrations. Consistent with the observation of a high density of TAAR1 in the medial preoptic area, o-PIT-induced hypothermia was significantly reduced in TAAR1-KO mice. Furthermore, the inhibition of a prepulse inhibition response by o-PIT, as well as its induction of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase phosphorylation and elevation of extracellular DA in prefrontal cortex, were all reduced in TAAR1-KO compared to wildtype mice. O-PIT was active in both forced-swim and marble-burying tests, and its effects were significantly blunted in TAAR1-KO mice. Conversely, the actions on behaviour and prefrontal cortex dialysis of a broad suite of clinically used antidepressants were unaffected in TAAR1-KO mice. In conclusion, o-PIT is a useful tool for exploring the hypothermic and other functional antidepressant roles of TAAR1.

Neither the chemerin central role on appetite regulation nor its relation to hypothalamic histamine and AMPK is verified. MAIN METHODS: Food intake, body weight and hypothalamic biochemical changes were assessed after a single intra-cerebroventricular or intraperitoneal injection (ip) (1Â Î¼g/kg or 16Â Î¼g/kg, respectively) or chronic ip administration (8Â Î¼g/kg/day) of chemerin for 14 or 28Â days. Hypothalamic neurobiochemical changes in chemerin/histamine/AMPK induced by either 8-week high fat diet (HFD) or food restriction were also investigated. To confirm chemerin-histamine crosstalk, these neurobiochemical changes were assessed under settings of H(1)-receptor agonism and/or antagonism by betahistine and/or olanzapine, respectively for 3Â weeks. KEY FINDINGS: Chemerin-injected rats exhibited anorexigenic behavior in both acute and chronic studies that was associated with a decreased AMPK activity in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). However, with long-term administration, chemerin anorexigenic effect gradually ceased. Contrarily to food restriction, 8-week HFD increased ARC expression of chemerin and its receptor CMKLR1, reducing food intake via an interplay of H(1)-receptors and AMPK activity. Blockage of H(1)-receptors by olanzapine disrupted chemerin signaling pathway with an increased AMPK activity, augmenting food intake. These changes were reversed to normal by betahistine coadministration. SIGNIFICANCE: Chemerin is an anorexigenic adipokine, whose dysregulation is implicated in diet, and olanzapine-induced obesity through a histamine/AMPK axis in the ARC. Hypothalamic chemerin/CMKLR1 expression is a dynamic time-dependent response to changes in body weight and/or food intake.

Our previous study showed that Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk), a promising probiotic, could protect against colitis via the regulation of the immune response. However, whether it can restore aberrant tryptophan (Trp) metabolism during colitis remains unclear. In this study, untargeted serum metabolomics of patients with UC and colitis mice showed that Trp metabolism was activated, which was confirmed by quantification of Trp metabolites from a validation cohort and animal study. Integrative analysis of faecal metagenomes and serum metabolomes revealed significant associations between Akk and three Trp metabolites. Live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 failed to restore the reduction in Trp metabolites involved in the serotonin pathway in colitis mice. However, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 increased kynurenine (Kyn) but decreased 2-picolinic acid (PIC) levels and the PIC/Kyn ratio without regulating any of the genes involved in Trp metabolism, suggesting that they could suppress the Kyn pathway (KP) independent of colon tissue. In addition, they could significantly restore the enrichment of Trp metabolism mediated by faecal microbiota. Specifically, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 could significantly offset the reduction in indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels. Pasteurised Akk significantly elevated the serum levels of indole acrylic acid (IA). In addition, live Akk, pasteurised Akk and Amuc_1100 could upregulate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) targeted genes, including CYP1A1, IL-10 and IL-22, suggesting that Akk could activate AhR signaling by regulating Trp metabolism, thereby attenuating colonic inflammation.",,England,2021,10.1039/d1fo02172a,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34532729

The study population consisted of clinically well-characterized and neuropathologically confirmed AD patients (nÂ =Â 42) and age-matched control subjects (nÂ =Â 18). Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and high-performance liquid chromatography were performed on Brodmann area (BA) 7, BA10, BA22, BA24, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and cerebellum to measure mRNA levels of 5-HT(7) receptors (HTR7), as well as the concentrations of various monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolites.

It is often characterized by a broad range of cognitive symptoms that are currently untreated. The serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor is a potentially relevant target in view of its ability to associate with neurofibromin and to engage the mTOR pathway to compromise cognition in several cognitive impairment paradigms. Here, we show that constitutively active 5-HT(6) receptors contribute to increased mTOR activity in the brain of Nf1(+/-) mice, a preclinical model recapitulating some behavioral alterations of NF1. Correspondingly, peripheral administration of SB258585, a 5-HT(6) receptor inverse agonist, or rapamycin, abolished deficits in long-term social and associative memories in Nf1(+/-) mice, whereas administration of CPPQ, a neutral antagonist, did not produce cognitive improvement. These results show a key influence of mTOR activation by constitutively active 5-HT(6) receptors in NF1 cognitive symptoms.

In particular, unexpected reward omission leads to a phasic decrease in DA (DA dip) in the striatum, which triggers long-term potentiation (LTP) in DA D2 receptor (D2R)-expressing spiny-projection neurons (D2 SPNs). While this LTP is required for reward discrimination, it is unclear how such a short DA-dip signal (0.5-2 s) is transferred through intracellular signaling to the coincidence detector, adenylate cyclase (AC). In the present study, we built a computational model of D2 signaling to determine conditions for the DA-dip detection. The DA dip can be detected only if the basal DA signal sufficiently inhibits AC, and the DA-dip signal sufficiently disinhibits AC. We found that those two requirements were simultaneously satisfied only if two key molecules, D2R and regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) were balanced within a certain range; this balance has indeed been observed in experimental studies. We also found that high level of RGS was required for the detection of a 0.5-s short DA dip, and the analytical solutions for these requirements confirmed their universality. The imbalance between D2R and RGS is associated with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia, both of which are accompanied by abnormal striatal LTP. Our simulations suggest that D2 SPNs in patients with schizophrenia and DYT1 dystonia cannot detect short DA dips. We finally discussed that such psychiatric and movement disorders can be understood in terms of the imbalance between D2R and RGS.",,United States,2021,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009364,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34591840

In non-human mammals, mothers secrete dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in response to their pups. Yet, it is still unknown which aspect of the offspring behavior elicits dopaminergic responses in mothers. Here, we tested whether infants' affective signals elicit dopaminergic responses in the NAcc of human mothers. First, we conducted a behavioral analysis on videos of infants' free play and quantified the affective signals infants spontaneously communicated. Then, we presented the same videos to mothers during a magnetic resonance-positron emission tomography scan. We traced the binding of [11C]raclopride to free D2/3-type receptors to assess maternal dopaminergic responses during the infant videos. When mothers observed videos with many infant signals during the scan, they had less [11C]raclopride binding in the right NAcc. Less [11C]raclopride binding indicates that less D2/3 receptors were free, possibly due to increased endogenous dopamine responses to infants' affective signals. We conclude that NAcc D2/3 receptors are involved in maternal responsiveness to affective signals of human infants.

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Therefore, we aimed to identify electrophysiologic alterations in animals neonatally treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, or with saline solution. KEY RESULTS: Patch-clamp whole-cell recordings from MK-801-treated animals revealed altered passive and active electrophysiologic properties compared with CA1 pyramidal cells from saline-treated animals, including up-regulation of the K(+) inward-rectifier conductance and fast-inactivating and slow/non-inactivating K(+) currents. Up-regulation of these membrane ionic currents reduced the overall excitability and altered the firing properties of CA1 pyramidal cells. We also explored the capability of cells treated with MK-801 to express intrinsic excitability potentiation, a non-synaptic form of hippocampal plasticity associated with cognition and memory formation. CA1 pyramidal cells from animals treated with MK-801 were unable to convey intrinsic excitability potentiation and had blunted synaptic potentiation. Furthermore, MK-801-treated animals also exhibited reduced cognitive performance in the Barnes maze task. Notably, activation of D1/D5 receptors with SKF-38,393 partially restored electrophysiologic alterations caused by neonatal treatment with MK-801.

We have previously shown that the Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)Val66Met polymorphism, related to depression, is associated with arterial thrombosis in mice, and with an increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in humans. Herein, expanding the previous findings on BDNFVal66Met polymorphism, we show that desipramine, a norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor, rescues behavioral impairments, reduces the arterial thrombosis risk, abolishes pathological coagulation and platelet hyper-reactivity, normalizes leukocyte, platelet, and bone marrow megakaryocyte number and restores physiological norepinephrine levels in homozygous knock-in BDNF Val66Met (BDNF(Met/Met)) mice. The in vitro data confirm the enhanced procoagulant activity and the alpha(2A)-adrenergic receptor (Î±(2A)-ADR) overexpression found in BDNF(Met/Met) mice and we provide evidence that, in presence of Met variant, norepinephrine is crucial to up-regulate procoagulant activity and to enhance platelet generation. The Î±(2)-ADR antagonist rauwolscine rescues the prothrombotic phenotype in BDNF(Met/Met) mice and reduces procoagulant activity and platelet generation in cells transfected with BDNF(Met) plasmid or exposed to pro-BDNF(Met) peptide. Finally, we show that homozygous BDNF(Met/Met) CAD patients have hyper-reactive platelets overexpressing abundant Î±(2A)-ADR.

AIMS: These adverse vascular/ metabolic events under clozapine are similar to those caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and clozapine shows structural similarity to well-known ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Therefore, we speculated that the side effects caused by clozapine might rely on AhR signaling. METHODS: We examined clozapine-induced AhR activation by luciferase reporter assays in hepatoma HepG2 cells and we proved upregulation of the prototypical AhR target gene Cyp1A1 by realtime-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis and enzyme activity. Next we studied the physiological role of AhR in clozapine's effects on human preadipocyte differentiation and on vasodilatation by myography in wild-type and AhR-/- mice. RESULTS: In contrast to other antipsychotic drugs (APDs), clozapine triggered AhR activation and Cyp1A1 expression in HepG2 cells and adipocytes. Clozapine induced adipogenesis via AhR signaling. After PGF2Î±-induced constriction of mouse aortic rings, clozapine strongly reduced the maximal vasorelaxation under acetylcholine in rings from wild-type mice, but only slightly in rings from AhR-/- mice. The reduction was also prevented by pretreatment with the AhR antagonist CH-223191.

MAO has two subtypes (MAO-A and MAO-B) that are encoded by different genes. In the brain, MAO-B is highly expressed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT); however, its substrate in PVT remains unclear. To identify the MAO-B substrate in PVT, we generated Maob knockout (KO) mice and measured five candidate substrates (i.e., noradrenaline, dopamine, 3-methoxytyramine, serotonin, and phenethylamine [PEA]) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We showed that only PEA levels were markedly elevated in the PVT of Maob KO mice. To exclude the influence of peripheral MAO-B deficiency, we developed brain-specific Maob KO mice, finding that PEA in the PVT was increased in brain-specific Maob KO mice, whereas the extent of PEA increase was less than that in global Maob KO mice. Given that plasma PEA levels were elevated in global KO mice, but not in brain-specific KO mice, and that PEA passes across the blood-brain barrier, the substantial accumulation of PEA in the PVT of Maob KO mice was likely due to the increase in plasma PEA. These data suggest that PEA is a substrate of MAO-B in the PVT as well as other tissues.",,England,2022,10.1038/s41598-021-03885-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-34996979

However, stress-causing social withdrawal also promotes dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Thus, this evidence suggests opposite functions of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex. However, the influence of dopamine on prefrontal functions is yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that dopamine differentially modulated the neuronal activity triggered by social stimuli in the prefrontal cortex, depending on the duration of the dopamine activation (transient or sustained activation). Using chemogenetic techniques, we have found that social behavior was negatively regulated by a sustained increase in dopamine neuronal activity in the ventral tegmental area, while it was positively regulated by an acute increase. The duration of social interactions was positively correlated with the transient dopamine release triggered by social stimuli in the prefrontal cortex and negatively correlated with the sustained increase in prefrontal dopamine levels. Furthermore, the elevation of neural calcium signal, triggered by social stimuli, in the prefrontal cortex was attenuated by the persistent elevation of prefrontal dopamine levels, whereas an acute increase in dopamine levels enhanced it. Additionally, the chronic excess of dopamine suppressed c-Fos induction triggered by social stimuli in prefrontal neurons expressing dopamine D1 receptors, but not D2 receptors. These results suggest that sustained activation of prefrontal dopamine, at the opposite of its transient activation, can reduce prefrontal activity associated with social behavior, even for identical dopamine concentrations.

The dopaminergic system is involved in both the etiology and therapeutics of depression. Distinct functions of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor subtypes have attracted considerable research interest, and their roles in the pathogenesis of depression and interaction with antidepressants need to be comprehensively elucidated. Herein, we investigated the antidepressant effects of a candidate antidepressant from a cinnamamide derivative, M2, and examined underlying neural mechanisms. We observed that a single dose of M2 (30â€‰mg/kg, ip) produced rapid antidepressant-like effects in mice subjected to the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Using whole-cell recordings in mouse coronal brain slices, we found that application of M2 (10-150â€‰Î¼M) concentration-dependently increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) of the pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Furthermore, M2-induced enhancement of sEPSC frequency was abolished by sulpiride (10â€‰ÂµM), a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, but not by the dopamine receptor D(1) antagonist, SCH23390 (10â€‰Î¼M). In addition, M2 administration significantly increased expression levels of synaptogenesis-related proteins, including p-mTOR and p-TrkB, in the mPFC at 30â€‰min, and increased postsynaptic protein PSD-95 at 24â€‰h.

OBJECTIVES: The present study explores the behavioral pharmacology of structurally distinct psychedelics in paradigms associated with serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) activation and behavioral disruption in two rodent models. Utilizing the selective 5-HT(2A)R antagonist volinanserin, we aimed to provide further pharmacological assessment of psychedelic effects in rodents. METHODS: We compared volinanserin (0.0001-0.1Â mg/kg) antagonism of the phenethylamine 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 1.0Â mg/kg) and the ergoline lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, 0.32Â mg/kg) in preclinical assays predictive of hallucinations (head-twitch response or HTR in mice) and behavioral disruption (intracranial self-stimulation or ICSS in rats). Volinanserin antagonism of the phenethylamine mescaline, the tryptamine psilocybin, and the k-opioid receptor agonist salvinorin A was also evaluated in the rat ICSS assay. RESULTS: Volinanserin had similar potency, effectiveness, and time-course to attenuate DOI-induced HTR in mice and ICSS depression in rats. Volinanserin completely blocked LSD-induced HTR in mice, but not LSD-induced ICSS depression in rats. Volinanserin also reversed ICSS depression by mescaline, but it was only partially effective to reduce the effects of psilocybin, and it exacerbated ICSS depression by salvinorin A.

22d6364f-24ea-4968-88a8-6f51d78c5572,Enduring changes in brain and behavior produced by chronic amphetamine administration: a review and evaluation of animal models of amphetamine psychosis.,Robinson TE and Becker JB ,Brain research,,"Some people who repeatedly use stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine (AMPH), develop an AMPH-induced psychosis that is similar to paranoid schizophrenia. There has been, therefore, considerable interest in characterizing the effects of chronic stimulant drug treatment on brain and behavior in non-human animals, and in developing an animal model of AMPH psychosis. A review of this literature shows that in non-human animals chronic AMPH treatment can produce at least two different syndromes, and both of these have been proposed as animal models of AMPH psychosis. The first syndrome is called 'AMPH neurotoxicity', and is produced by maintaining elevated brain concentrations of AMPH for prolonged periods of time. AMPH neurotoxicity is characterized by what has been termed 'hallucinatory-like' behavior, which occurs in association with brain damage resulting in the depletion of striatal DA and other brain monoamines. The second syndrome is called 'behavioral sensitization', and is produced by the repeated intermittent administration of lower doses of AMPH. Behavioral sensitization is characterized by a progressive and enduring enhancement in many AMPH-induced behaviors, and is not accompanied by brain damage or monoamine depletion. It is argued that the changes in the brain and behavior associated with the phenomenon of behavioral sensitization provide a better 'model' of AMPH psychosis than those associated with AMPH neurotoxicity. Much of the review involves a critical analysis of hypotheses regarding the biological basis of behavioral sensitization. Research on this question has focused on mesotelencephalic DA systems, and suggestions that behavioral sensitization is accompanied by: an increase in postsynaptic DA receptors; an increase in DA synthesis; an increase in DA utilization and/or release; and a decrease in DA autoreceptors, are evaluated. It is concluded that there is not convincing evidence for an increase in postsynaptic DA receptors or in DA synthesis in animals sensitized to AMPH. In contrast, there is strong evidence to support the notion that behavioral sensitization is due to enhanced mesotelencephalic DA release, especially upon re-exposure to the drug. The evidence that this enhancement in DA release is due to autoreceptor subsensitivity was found to be equivocal, and therefore other hypotheses should be entertained. Lastly, evidence is discussed in support of the idea that behavioral sensitization is not unique to the psychopharmacology of stimulant drugs, but may be produced by many environmental stimuli that directly or indirectly activate brain catecholamine systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,Netherlands,1986,10.1016/s0006-8993(86)80193-7,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3527341

Specifically, complete inactivation of the gene encoding tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (Tph2) results in the absence of neuronal 5-HT synthesis and excessive aggressiveness in both male and female null mutant (Tph2(-/-)) mice. In heterozygous male mice (Tph2(+/-)), there is a moderate reduction in brain 5-HT levels, and when they are exposed to stress, they exhibit increased aggression. Here, we exposed female Tph2(+/-) mice to a five-day rat predation stress paradigm and assessed their emotionality and social interaction/aggression-like behaviors. Tph2(+/-) females exhibited excessive aggression and increased dominant behavior. Stressed mutants displayed altered gene expression of the 5-HT receptors Htr1a and Htr2a, glycogen synthase kinase-3 Î² (GSK-3Î²), and c-fos as well as myelination-related transcripts in the prefrontal cortex: myelin basic protein (Mbp), proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1), myelin-associated glycoprotein (Mag), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (Mog).

It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT(1A) /5-HT(7) hetero- and 5-HT(1A) /5-HT(1A) homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT(1A) /5-HT(1A) homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT(7) receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect.

These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT(7) receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT(7) receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT(7) receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT(1A) receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT(7) receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT(7) receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in ""depressive"" ASC male mice.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), an active ingredient extracted from the roots of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer, has potential health-promoting effects on the nervous system. However, its role in substance use disorders remains unclear. Here, we explored the potential modulatory roles of Rg1 in protection against morphine dependence. METHODS: Conditioned place preference (CPP) was used for establishing a murine model of morphine dependence. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics were performed for microbial and metabolite analysis. Molecular analysis was tested for evaluating the host serum and brain responses. RESULTS: Rg1 prevented morphine-induced CPP in mice. The 16S rRNA gene-based microbiota analysis demonstrated that Rg1 ameliorated morphine-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, specifically for Bacteroidetes. Moreover, Rg1 also inhibited gut microbiota-derived tryptophan metabolism and reduced the serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HTR1B), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2Â A (5-HTR2A) levels. However, the Rg1-induced amelioration of CPP was not observed in mice when their gut microbiome was depleted by non-absorbable antibiotics. Subsequently, gavage with Bacteroides vulgatus increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes. B. vulgatus supplementation synergistically enhanced Rg1-alleviated morphine-induced CPP in mice with microbiome knockdown.

Although animal studies have examined withdrawal symptoms following exposure to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), difficulties in obtaining objective measures of spontaneous withdrawal using paradigms that mimic cessation of use in humans have slowed research. The neuromodulator dopamine (DA) is affected by chronic THC treatment and plays a role in many behaviors related to human THC withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms include sleep disturbances that often drive relapse, and emotional behaviors like irritability and anhedonia. We examined THC withdrawal-induced changes in striatal DA release and the extent to which sleep disruption and behavioral maladaptation manifest during abstinence in a mouse model ofÂ chronic THC exposure. Using a THC treatment regimen known to produce tolerance, we measured electrically elicited DA release in acute brain slices from different striatal subregions during early and late THC abstinence. Long-term polysomnographic recordings from mice were used to assess vigilance state and sleep architecture before, during, and after THC treatment. We additionally assessed how behaviors that model human withdrawal symptoms are altered by chronic THC treatment in early and late abstinence. We detected altered striatal DA release, sleep disturbances that mimic clinical observations, and behavioral maladaptation in mice following tolerance to THC. Altered striatal DA release, sleep, and affect-related behaviors associated with spontaneous THC abstinence were more consistently observed in male mice.

AIM OF THE STUDY: Investigating the effect of Bombax costatum stem bark aqueous extract (BC) on depression associated with amnesia and vascular disorder, using a chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) model in rats for 30 days. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sucrose Preference Test (SPT), Forced Swimming Test (FST), corticosteronemia, brain serotonin and dopamine level were evaluated as indices of antidepressant-like effect. The Novel Object Recognition Task (NOR), the Morris Water Maze (MWM) and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus were also used to verify memory integrity. Oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, the lipid profile and atherogenic index were estimated in blood serum to assess vasoprotective effect. Chlorophenylalanine and haloperidol, were used to delineate the extract's mechanism of action. RESULTS: CMUS induced a decrease in sucrose preference and swimming time in the SPT and FST respectively while BC (27.5 and 55Â mg/kg) increased sucrose preference and swimming time. Increments in these parameters were however reversed by the treatment of rats with chlorophenylalanine a serotonin synthesis inhibitor and haloperidol a D2 receptor antagonist. An increase in blood corticosterone level, prefrontal cortex malondialdehyde and nitric oxide concentrations were reversed by the extract. Moreover, BC increased the time spent in the target quadrant of the MWM test and the discrimination index in the NOR test. This was associated with an increase in hippocampus superoxide dismutase and catalase levels, a decrease in acetylcholine esterase level, total blood cholesterol and atherogenicity index compared to CMUS group. CONCLUSION: Thirty days CMUS induces a depressive state in rats. BC reverses this condition when administered alongside stress exposure. This antidepressive effect is associated with antiamnesic, antioxidant and vasoprotective actions, suggesting its use as a potential candidate in the management of major depressive disorder.",,Ireland,2022,10.1016/j.jep.2022.115315,Journal Article,Acetylcholinesterase and Amnesia and Cardiovascular disease and Chronic mild unpredictable stress and Corticosterone and Depression and Monoamine,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-35487448

In the rat brain, the D3R mRNA is enriched in the limbic striatum as opposed to the D2 receptor, which is highly expressed in the motor striatal areas. Later studies in the primate and human brain confirmed relative enrichment of the D3R in the limbic striatum but also demonstrated higher abundance of theÂ D3R in the primate as compared to the rodent brain. Additionally, in the rodent brain, the D3R in the dorsal striatum appears to be co-expressed with the D1 dopamine receptor-bearing striatal neurons giving rise to the direct output striatal pathway, although the picture is less clear with respect to the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, in the primate striatum, the D3R co-localizes with the D2 receptor throughout the basal ganglia as well as in extrastriatal brain areas. The relative abundance of the D3R in the limbic striatum, its output structures, secondary targets, and some of the other connected limbic territories may underpin its role in reward, drug dependence, and impulse control.

ErbB4 transcripts are alternatively spliced to generate isoforms that either include (Cyt-1) or exclude (Cyt-2) exon 26, which encodes a cytoplasmic domain that imparts ErbB4 receptors the ability to signal via the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Although ErbB4 Cyt-1/2 isoforms have been studied in transfected cultured cells, their functions in vivo remain unknown. Here, we generated ErbB4-floxed (ErbB4-Cyt1(fl/fl) ) mice to investigate the effects of germline (constitutive) and conditional (acute) deletions of the Cyt-1 exon. Overall receptor mRNA levels remain unchanged in germline ErbB4 Cyt-1 knockouts (Cyt-1 KOs), with all transcripts encoding Cyt-2 variants. In contrast to mice lacking all ErbB4 receptor function, GABAergic interneuron migration and number are unaltered in Cyt-1 KOs. However, basal extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex are increased in Cyt-1 heterozygotes. Despite these neurochemical changes, Cyt-1 heterozygous and homozygous mice do not manifest behavioral abnormalities previously reported to be altered in ErbB4 null mice. To address the possibility that Cyt-2 variants compensate for the lack of Cyt-1 during development, we microinjected an adeno-associated virus expressing Cre-recombinase (AAV-Cre) into the DA-rich ventral tegmental area of adult ErbB4-Cyt1(fl/fl) mice to acutely target exon 26. These conditional Cyt-1 KOs were found to exhibit behavioral abnormalities in the elevated plus maze and startle response, consistent with the idea that late exon 26 ablations may circumvent compensation by Cyt-2 variants.

The available treatments do not present a desirable efficacy and some of them provoke several adverse effects. In this context, organoselenium compounds and molecules containing the indolizine nucleus have demonstrated interesting pharmacological properties, including antidepressant-like effects. In this study, the antidepressant-like effect of 2-phenyl-1-(phenylselanyl)indolizine (SeI), a selenium-containing indolizine derivative, was investigated on the forced swimming test (FST) and on the tail suspension test (TST) in male Swiss mice. The involvement of the serotonergic system in this effect was also accessed. The selenium compound SeI (10-100 mg/kg, intragastrical (i.g.)) was administered 0.5 h before the behavioral tests, and it diminished the immobility on both FST and TST experiments, which is an indication of antidepressant-like effect. No changing in the locomotor motion was observed in the open-field test (OFT). The anti-immobility effect of SeI was not altered by the preadministration of the selective serotonergic receptor antagonists ondansetron (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.), antagonist of 5-HT(3) receptor) and WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous route (s.c.), antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptor). In contrast, the preadministration of ketanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p., antagonist of 5-HT(2A/C) receptor) blocked this effect, demonstrating that the antidepressant-like effect of SeI involves 5-HT(2A/C). In addition, molecular docking studies showed a strong interaction between SeI and the receptors of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C). The toxicological results demonstrated that SeI has low potential to cause adverse effects in mice.

Nonetheless, MDMA is misused by humans and self-administered by laboratory animals. We have previously shown that repeated exposure to MDMA sensitized both the locomotor activating and reinforcing effects of MDMA in rats. Because repeated MDMA exposure often results in decreased markers of serotonin neurotransmission, it is possible that this might underlie the sensitizing effects of MDMA. This was examined in the current study. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were stereotaxically implanted with guide cannula in the medial striatum. They were then pre-treated with saline (nâ€¯=â€¯â€¯11) or MDMA (10â€¯mg/kg, i.p.; nâ€¯=â€¯â€¯10), once daily for five days. Two-days later, all rats received ascending doses of MDMA (0.0, 5.0, 10.0, mg/kg, i.p.) administered at 2â€¯hr intervals, during which locomotor activity was measured and microdialysis samples were collected. Microdialysates were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and the concentrations of serotonin and MDMA were quantified. Acute MDMA administration produced dose-dependent increases in locomotor activity, which was significantly enhanced by MDMA pre-treatment. Acute MDMA also produced dose-dependent increases in medial-striatal serotonin and MDMA, but this was not impacted by MDMA pre-treatment. These results suggest that the sensitizing effects of MDMA are not due to changes in MDMA-produced synaptic overflow of serotonin in the medial striatum or the absorption/elimination of systemically administered MDMA. More likely candidates are alterations in serotonin receptor mechanisms and/or dopamine neurotransmission following repeated exposure.",,Netherlands,2022,10.1016/j.bbr.2022.113936,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",LCMS and MDMA and Microdialysis and Sensitization and Serotonin and Striatum,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-35605796

In experimental study with rats, cyclazocine is known to increase locomotor activity and to produce a bizarre behavioral syndrome including head swaying, backward walking, circling. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of various drugs modifying the serotoninergic neuronal systems, upon the locomotor activity and the abnormal behaviors induced by cyclazocine. Pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 400 mg/kg, 72, 48, 24 hr) resulted in an inhibition of the three abnormal behaviors. Pretreatment with p-chloromethylamphetamine (PCMA, 15 mg/kg, 24 hr) antagonized head swaying, backward walking and markedly enhanced locomotor activity. In the contrary, pretreatment with PCMA (2.5 mg/kg, 15 min) resulted in enhanced abnormal behavioral responses to cyclazocine. L-tryptophan (50 mg/kg), 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, 50 mg/kg), or pargyline (50 mg/kg) inhibited abnormal behaviors and decreased locomotor activity. Serotonin antagonists with affinity fir both 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors, metergoline (0.25-1 mg/kg), methysergide (1-5 mg/kg), amitriptyline (5-20 mg/kg), dl-propranolol (10-40 mg/kg) blocked head swaying and backward walking; only methysergide inhibited circling. All these drugs, except methysergide, markedly enhanced the cyclazocine-induced locomotor activity. In contrast, ketanserine (0.5-2 mg/kg) and pirenperone (0.05-0.2 mg/kg), serotonin antagonists with selective affinity for 5-HT2 receptors had no effects on the abnormal behaviors and locomotor activity. Taken together, these results suggest that a serotoninergic mediation is involved in the cyclazocine-induced abnormal behaviors, and that serotonin exerts an inhibitory control on the locomotor activity produced by the drug. These effects are probably associated with 5-HT1 receptors. Further experiments have shown that the drugs having being able to potentiate cyclazocine-induced locomotor activity, similarly potentiate the locomotor activity induced by levallorphan, morphinan derivative with cyclazocine-like properties but do not enhance the hyperactivity produced by a low dose of morphine.

Previous studies have suggested a potential association of brain histaminergic/serotoninergic signaling and antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects. Here, we evaluated the in vivo antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of the newly developed multiple-active ligand ST-2300. ST-2300 was developed from 5-HT(2A/2C) inverse agonist pimavanserin (PIM, ACP-103) and incorporates a histamine H(3) receptor (H(3)R) antagonist pharmacophore. Despite its parent compound, ST-2300 showed only moderate serotonin 5-HT(2A) antagonist/inverse agonist affinity (K(i) value of 1302 nM), but excellent H(3)R affinity (K(i) value of 14 nM). In vivo effects were examined using forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and the open field test (OFT) in C57BL/6 mice. Unlike PIM, ST-2300 significantly increased the anxiolytic-like effects in OFT without altering general motor activity. In FST and TST, ST-2300 was able to reduce immobility time similar to fluoxetine (FLX), a recognized antidepressant drug. Importantly, pretreatment with the CNS-penetrant H(3)R agonist (R)-Î±-methylhistamine reversed the antidepressant-like effects of ST-2300 in FST and TST, but failed to reverse the ST-2300-provided anxiolytic effects in OFT.

Both NLX-112 and (Â±)8-OH-DPAT (0.16-2.5 mg/kg p.o. or s.c., respectively) abolished catalepsy induced by tetrabenazine (2 mg/kg i.p.). In comparison, buspirone (0.63-5.0 mg/kg p.o.) was ineffective and even tended to potentiate tetrabenazine-induced catalepsy at 0.63 mg/kg. In the FST, NLX-112 and (Â±)8-OH-DPAT (0.63 mg/kg) strongly reduced immobility when administered alone but also significantly opposed potentiation of immobility induced by tetrabenazine (1.5 mg/kg i.p.). Buspirone (0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o.) had no effect by itself or against tetrabenazine. These results strongly suggest that selective and highly efficacious 5-HT 1A agonists, such as NLX-112, may be useful in combating tetrabenazine-induced Parkinsonism and/or depression in Huntington's disease patients.",,England,2022,10.1097/FBP.0000000000000681,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-35695543

Studies in rats and mice yielded contrasting results on the control of 5-HT/DA networks by 5-HT(2B)Rs, thereby leading to opposite views on the therapeutic potential of 5-HT(2B)R agents for treating the above disorders. These discrepancies may result from anatomo-functional differences related to a different cellular location of 5-HT(2B)Rs in rat and mouse brain. Using immunohistochemistry, we assessed this hypothesis by examining the expression of 5-HT(2B)Rs in 5-HT and GABAergic neurons of rats and mice within different subregions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), currently considered as the main site of action of 5-HT(2B) agents. Likewise, using in vivo microdialysis, we examined their functional relevance in the control of DRN 5-HT outflow, a surrogate index of 5-HT neuronal activity. In the DRN of both species, 5-HT(2B)Rs are expressed in 5-HT cells expressing tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH(2)), in GABAergic cells expressing glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67), and in cells expressing both markers (GAD67 & TPH(2); i.e., GABA-expressing 5-HT neurons). The proportion of 5-HT(2B)R-positive cells expressing only TPH(2) was significantly larger in mouse than in rat DRN, whereas the opposite holds true for the expression in cells expressing GAD67 & TPH(2). No major species differences were found in the dorsal and ventral subregions. In contrast, the lateral subregion exhibited large differences, with a predominant expression of 5-HT(2B)Rs in TPH(2)-positive cells in mice (67.2 vs 19.9Â % in rats), associated with a lower expression in GAD67 & TPH(2) cells (7.9Â % in mice vs 41.5Â % in rats). Intra-DRN (0.1Â Î¼M) administration of the preferential 5-HT(2B)R agonist BW 723C86 decreased and increased DRN 5-HT outflow in rats and mice respectively, both effects being prevented by the intra-DRN perfusion of the selective 5-HT(2B)R antagonist RS 127445 (0.1Â Î¼M). Altogether, these results show the existence of anatomical differences in the cellular expression of 5-HT(2B)Rs in the rat and mouse DRN, which translate into an opposite control of 5-HT outflow. Also, they highlight the relevance of the subset of GAD67-positive 5-HT neurons as a key factor responsible for the functional differences between rats and mice in terms of 5-HT neuronal activity modulation.",,United States,2022,10.1016/j.mcn.2022.103750,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT(2B) receptor and Dorsal raphe nucleus and Immunohistochemistry and Mouse and Rat and Serotonin release,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-35697176

Psychedelics are new antidepressant candidates, being the ayahuasca one of the most promising ones. A synergistic combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and Î²-carbolines allows ayahuasca antidepressant properties. Another psychedelic and DMT-containing beverage is the jurema wine used religiously by indigenous people from Northeastern Brazil. AIMS: To evaluate the antidepressant-like effect of standardized extract of Mimosa tenuiflora (SEMT), associated or not with harmine (Î²-carboline), in behavioral models of depression. METHODS: The SEMT was submitted to (+) ESI-IT-LC/MS analysis for DMT quantification. To assess the antidepressant-like effect of SEMT, the open field (OFT), tail suspension (TST), and forced swim (FST) tests were performed. To verify the participation of serotonergic systems, the 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitch test was performed. RESULTS: The content of DMT found in SEMT was 24.74â€‰Â±â€‰0.8â€‰mg/g. Yuremamine was also identified. SEMT presented an antidepressant-like effect in mice submitted to the TST and FST, independent from harmine, with no significant alterations on the OFT. The sub-dose interaction between SEMT and ketamine also produced an anti-immobility effect in the TST, with no changes in the OFT. SEMT potentiated the head twitch behavior induced by 5-HTP and ketanserin prevented its antidepressant-like effect in the TST (pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).

Here, we hypothesised that a higher dose of LY341495, associated with a higher antagonistic effect at mGlu(3) receptors, would result in a reduction of the reversal of mGlu(2) activation and 5-HT(2A) blockade on dyskinesia, in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned marmoset. METHODS: After induction of parkinsonism with MPTP, marmosets entered 3 streams of experiments, in which the following treatments were administered, in combination with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), after which dyskinesia, psychosis-like behaviours (PLBs) and parkinsonism were rated: 1. vehicle/vehicle, LY354740 (mGlu(2/3) orthosteric agonist)/vehicle, LY354740/LY341495 1Â mg/kg and LY354740/LY341495 3Â mg/kg; 2. vehicle/vehicle, LY487379 (mGlu(2) positive allosteric modulator)/vehicle, LY487379/LY341495 1Â mg/kg and LY487379/LY341495 3Â mg/kg; 3. vehicle/vehicle, EMD-281,014 (5-HT(2A) antagonist)/vehicle, EMD-281,014/LY341495 1Â mg/kg and EMD-281,014/LY341495 3Â mg/kg. RESULTS: Each of LY354740, LY487379 and EMD-281,014 reduced the severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, by 55%, 39% and 40%, respectively (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.001), as well as the severity of PLBs, by 48%, 36% and 41%, respectively (all pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). Adding LY341495 1 and 3Â mg/kg to each of LY354740, LY487379 and EMD-281,014 resulted in a dose-dependent reversal of their anti-dyskinetic and anti-psychotic actions. No effect on the anti-parkinsonian action of L-DOPA was noted with any treatment combination.

However, the mechanism by which this occurs has not been clarified. Previous studies found that dopamine-deficient (DD) mice exhibited hyperactivity in a novel environment. This hyperactivity is improved by clozapine and donepezil, which are used to treat psychiatric symptoms associated with dopamine deficiency (PSDD). We considered that DD mice could be used to study PSDD. In the present study, we sought to identify the pharmacological mechanism of PSDD. We conducted locomotor activity tests by administering quetiapine and drugs that have specific actions on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptors and muscarinic receptors. Changes in neuronal activity that were induced by drug administration in DD mice were evaluated by examining Fos immunoreactivity. Quetiapine suppressed hyperactivity in DD mice while the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635 inhibited this effect. The number of Fos-positive neurons in the median raphe nucleus increased in DD mice that exhibited hyperactivity and was decreased by treatment with quetiapine and 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists. In conclusion, hyperactivity in DD mice was ameliorated by quetiapine, likely through 5-HT(1A) receptor activation. These findings suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptors may play a role in PSDD, and 5-HT(1A) receptor-targeting drugs may help improve PSDD.",,Switzerland,2022,10.3390/ijms23137436,Journal Article,5-HT1A receptor and Parkinson<e2><80><99>s disease and dopamine deficiency and dopamine-deficient mice and psychiatric symptoms,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-35806448

We therefore compared the in vivo effects of 5-HT on pyramidal neuron activity in IL (nÂ =â€‰61) and PrL (nÂ =â€‰50) of anesthetized rats. IL pyramidal neurons were more responsive to physiological dorsal raphe stimulation (0.9Â Hz) than PrL neurons (84% vs. 64%, respectively) and were inhibited to a greater extent (64% vs. 36%, respectively). Orthodromic activations (8% in PrL) were absent in IL, whereas biphasic responses were similar (20%) in both areas. Excitations were mediated by 5-HT2A-R activation, whereas inhibitions involved 3 different components: 5-HT1A-R, 5-HT3-R and GABAA-R, respectively.

However, long-term treatment often leads to motor complications such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). While amantadine (Gocovriâ„¢) is the only approved therapy for dyskinesia in PD patients on the American market, it is associated with neurological side effects and limited efficacy. Thus, there remains a high unmet need for addressing LID in PD patients worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and performance compared to approved treatments of the serotonin receptor 1A (5-HT1A) and 5-HT1B/D agonists buspirone and zolmitriptan in the 6-hydroxydopamine unilaterally lesioned rat model for PD. METHODS: The hemiparkinsonian 6-OHDA-lesioned rats underwent chronic treatment with L-DOPA to induce dyskinesia and were subsequently used for efficacy testing of buspirone, zolmitriptan and comparison with amantadine, measured as abnormal involuntary movement (AIM) scores after L-DOPA challenge. Safety testing was performed in model and naÃ¯ve animals using forelimb adjusting, rotarod and open field tests. RESULTS: 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D agonism effectively reduced AIM scores in a synergistic manner. The drug combination of buspirone and zolmitriptan was safe and did not lead to tolerance development following sub-chronic administration. Head-to-head comparison with amantadine showed superior performance of buspirone and zolmitriptan in the model.

The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine has been shown to attenuate disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model that is useful for the study of multiple sclerosis.

To better understand how clozapine exerts its protective effects, we investigated the underlying signalling pathways by which clozapine may reduce immune cell migration by evaluating chemokine and dopamine receptor-associated signalling pathways. We found that clozapine inhibits migration of immune cells by reducing chemokine production in microglia cells by targeting NF-ÎºB phosphorylation and promoting an anti-inflammatory milieu. Furthermore, clozapine directly targets immune cell migration by changing Ca(2+) levels within immune cells and reduces the phosphorylation of signalling protein AKT.

This study tested the hypothesis that motivation and associated underlying biological pathways are altered in the absence of Î±-DB expression. Male wildtype and Î±-DB KO mice were tested for measures of motivation, executive function and extinction in the rodent touchscreen apparatus. Subsequently, brain tissues were evaluated for mRNA and/or protein levels of dysbindin-1, dopamine transporter and receptor 1 and 2, mu opioid receptor 1 (mOR1) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Î±-DB KO mice had significantly increased motivation for the appetitive reward, while measures of executive function and extinction were unaffected.

In addition, haloperidol is classified as a sigma-1 receptor (S1R) antagonist that prevents endogenous oxidative stress in cultured cells. However, pharmacological activities of haloperidol against oxidative stress remain unclear. Oxytosis/ferroptosis are iron-dependent nonapoptotic oxidative cell deaths that are regarded as two names for the same cell death pathway and the potential physiological relevance of oxytosis/ferroptosis in multiple diseases is suggested. In the present study, the effects of haloperidol on oxytosis/ferroptosis were investigated in S1R-knockdown mouse hippocampal HT22 cells. The results indicate that haloperidol is a strong inhibitor of oxytosis/ferroptosis independent of S1R. Imaging of HT22 cells with a newly developed fluorescent probe showed that haloperidol was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes and reduced the accumulation of lysosomal ferrous ions, resulting in reduced production of intracellular reactive oxygen species and inhibition of cell death. These results indicate that haloperidol is useful not only as an antipsychotic agent but also as a neuroprotective agent against endogenous oxidative stress via distinct mechanisms.

Notably, disruption of the 5-HT system during sensitive periods of development seems to exert long-term consequences, including altered anxiety responses and problematic use of alcohol. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed, in mice, the effects of transient 5-HT depletion at gestation (a developmental stage when medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) 5-HT levels depend exclusively on placental 5-HT availability) on 5-HT central synthesis and reuptake at weaning. We also explored if 5-HT disruption at the embryonic stage influences behavioral outcomes that may serve as a proxy for autistic- or anxiety-like phenotypes. METHODS: C57/BL6 male and female mice, born from dams treated with a 5-HT synthesis inhibitor (PCPA; 4-Chloro-DL-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride) at gestational days (G)13.5-16.5, were subjected to a behavioral battery that assesses social preference and novelty, compulsive behavior, stereotypies, and ethanol's anti-anxiety effects, at postnatal days (P) 21-28. Afterwards, expression of the genes that encode for 5-HT synthesis (Tph2) and SERT (5-HT transporter) were analyzed in mPFC via real-time RT-PCR. Dopamine 2 receptor (D2R) expression was also analyzed via RT-PCR to further explore possible effects of PCPA on dopaminergic transmission. RESULTS: Transient 5-HT disruption at G13.5-16.5 reduced Tph2 expression of both male and female mice in mPFC at P23. Notably, female mice also exhibited higher SERT expression and reduced D2R expression in mPFC. Mice derived from 5-HT depleted dams displayed heightened compulsive behavior at P21, when compared to control mice. Alcohol anti-anxiety effects at early adolescence (P28) were exhibited by mice derived from 5-HT depleted dams, but not by control counterparts. No social deficits or stereotyped behaviors were observed. CONCLUSION: Transient 5-HT inhibition at gestation resulted in altered expression of genes involved in 5-HT synthesis and reuptake in mPFC at weaning, a period in which the 5-HT system is still developing. These alterations may exert lingering effects, which translate to significant compulsivity and heightened sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of alcohol at early adolescence.",,Germany,2022,10.1007/s00213-022-06228-z,Journal Article,5-HT and Alcohol and Compulsive behavior and EPM and Embryonic stage and PCPA and Tph2-SERT,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36063206

But the underlying mechanism and the specific role of tumor immunity in this process are still unknown. Herein, we applied the repeated restrain stress model in C57BL/6J mice and found that the tumor growth in stressed mice was accelerated compared with that in control mice. In addition, serotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in the serum of stressed mice was also elevated. Sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used in the clinic, can restore the serum 5-HT level in stressed mice and restrain tumor growth. We further explored the distribution of major immune cells, including B lymphocytes cells, T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and regulatory T cells (Treg). We found that the infiltration of CD8 + T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) decreased significantly in stressed mice. And the extra 5-HT treatment could further decrease the infiltration of CD8 + T cells in the TME. The expression of IFN-Î³ and Granular enzyme B (GzmB) in CD8 + T cells were also dropped in the stressed mice group, whereas the expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on CD8 + T cells was increased. The T cell deficiency induced by stress can be reversed by sertraline, indicating its promising role in strengthening the efficacy of anti-PDL1/PD-1 immunotherapy.

Structural modifications of dendritic spines are central to brain development and plasticity. Using maternal immune activation (MIA) as a rodent model of prenatal environmental insult, previous results have reported dendritic structural deficits in the frontal cortex. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying MIA-induced synaptic structural alterations in the offspring. Using prenatal (E12.5) injection with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid potassium salt as a mouse MIA model, we show here that upregulation of the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) is at least in part responsible for some of the effects of prenatal insults on frontal cortex dendritic spine structure and sensorimotor gating processes. Mechanistically, we report that this upregulation of frontal cortex 5-HT(2A)R expression is associated with MIA-induced reduction of nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and, consequently, a decrease in the enrichment of GR at the 5-HT(2A)R promoter. The translational significance of these preclinical findings is supported by data in postmortem human brain samples suggesting dysregulation of GR translocation in frontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects. We also found that repeated corticosterone administration augmented frontal cortex 5-HT(2A)R expression and reduced GR binding to the 5-HT(2A)R promoter. However, virally (adeno-associated virus) mediated augmentation of GR function reduced frontal cortex 5-HT(2A)R expression and improved sensorimotor gating processes via 5-HT(2A)R. Together, these data support a negative regulatory relationship between GR signaling and 5-HT(2A)R expression in the mouse frontal cortex that may carry implications for the pathophysiology underlying 5-HT(2A)R dysregulation in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders.",,United States,2022,10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102481,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",G protein<e2><80><93>coupled receptor and dendritic spines and glucocorticoid receptor and maternal immune activation and neurodevelopmental psychiatric conditions and schizophrenia and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36100039

A model describing the competitive drug-receptor interactions was fitted to the data and yielded estimates of the association and dissociation rate constants of the agonist and the antagonist. A high concentration of the agonist ([agonist] much greater than KA) was used to reduce the influence of antagonist diffusion to the receptor upon the onset of antagonism. The effect of a diffusion barrier was evaluated by comparing the kinetics of drug competition in the absence and in the presence of the adventitia. The rate constants of the high-affinity antagonists spiperone, methysergide or ketanserin were similar in the absence and in the presence of the adventitia. In contrast, the rate constants of the low affinity antagonist 5-methoxygramine were reduced almost 5-fold in the presence of the adventitia. This observation may be explained by the large partition coefficients of the high-affinity antagonists as compared to the relatively low partition coefficient of 5-methoxygramine. The ratios of the estimated rate constants (k-x/kx) are in good agreement with the dissociation constants of the drugs determined with steady-state methods. In addition the results suggest that the association rate constant is a primary determinant of drug affinity for the receptor. The kinetic rate constants of the high-affinity antagonists measured in this preparation are similar to those previously reported in high-affinity binding studies.

They are risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality and reduced quality of life. Despite their detrimental effects on health, there is a lack of knowledge regarding translation across the domains of experimental research, clinical studies, and real-life applications. Here, we review and synthesize evidence from basic research in animals and humans to clinical translation and interventions. Animal models indicate that social separation stress, particularly in early life, activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and interacts with monoaminergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurotransmitter systems, inducing long-lasting reductions in serotonin turnover and alterations in dopamine receptor sensitivity. These findings are of particular importance for human social isolation stress, as effects of social isolation stress on the same neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in addictive, psychotic, and affective disorders. Children may be particularly vulnerable due to lasting effects of social isolation and discrimination stress on the developing brain. The effects of social isolation and loneliness are pronounced in the context of social exclusion due to discrimination and racism, during widespread infectious disease related containment strategies such as quarantine, and in older persons due to sociodemographic changes. This highlights the importance of new strategies for social inclusion and outreach, including gender, culture, and socially sensitive telemedicine and digital interventions for mental health care.",,United States,2022,10.1038/s41398-022-02178-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36130935

The concomitant activation of the two receptors nulls their inhibitory activities, whereas blockade of the 5-HT(2A) heteroreceptors with MDL11,939 (1 Î¼M) strengthens the inhibitory effect elicited by the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY329268 (1 Î¼M). 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists (MDL11,939; ketanserin; trazodone) amplify the impact of low (3 nM) LY379268.

Given the rapid emergence of new substances and their constantly changing chemical structure, it is necessary to develop an efficient and expeditious approach to examine the mechanisms underlying their pharmacological and toxicological effects. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have become a popular experimental subject for drug screening due to their amenability to high-throughput approaches. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we used methamphetamine (METH) as an exemplary psychoactive substance to investigate its acute toxicity and possible underlying mechanisms in 5-day post-fertilization (5 dpf) zebrafish larvae. METHODS: Lethality and toxicity of different concentrations of METH were examined in 5-dpf zebrafish larvae using a 96-well plate format. RESULTS: METH induced lethality in zebrafish larvae in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with initial sympathomimetic activation, followed by cardiotoxicity. This was evidenced by significant heart rate increases at low doses, followed by decreased cardiac function at high doses and later time points. Levels of ammonia in the excreted water were increased but decreased internally. There was also evidence of seizures. Co-administration of the glutamate AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI-52466 and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride significantly attenuated METH-induced lethality, suggesting that this lethality may be mediated synergistically or independently by glutamatergic and dopaminergic systems.

Although the main target for serotoninergic psychedelics, serotonin type 2A receptor (5-HT(2A)), has been established, the possible mechanism of the antidepressant action of psychedelics remains unknown. Using the mouse forced swim test model, we examined whether the administration of the synthetic serotoninergic psychedelic 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) would modulate 5-HT(2A) receptor levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and revert stress-induced changes in behavior. Mice subjected to swim stress developed a passive stress-coping strategy when tested in the forced swim test 6 days later. This change in behavior was not associated with the hypothesized increase in 5-HT(2A) receptor-dependent head twitch behaviors or consistent changes in 5-HT(2A) receptor levels in the mPFC. When DOI was administered 1 day before the forced swim test, a low dose (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) unexpectedly increased immobility while a high dose (2 mg/kg i.p.) had no significant effect on immobility. Nevertheless, DOI evoked a dose-dependent decrease in 5-HT(2A) levels in the mPFC of mice previously exposed to swim stress. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the downregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the mPFC contributes to the antidepressant-like properties of serotoninergic psychedelics.",,Switzerland,2022,10.3390/ijms232315284,Journal Article,5-HT2A and DOI and behavioral despair and downregulation and head twitch and mPFC and mice and psychedelics and stress,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36499610

One potential source of PDAP in late-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) is the common dopamine (DA) replacement therapy for motor symptoms, Levodopa (L-DOPA). Given the high incidence of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) in later phases of PD, this study sought to characterize the relationship between PDAP and LID in a bilateral medial forebrain bundle 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (6-OHDA) lesion rat model. To assess PDAP in this model, prepulse inhibition (PPI), a well-validated assay of sensorimotor gating, was employed. First, we tested whether a bilateral lesion alone or after chronic L-DOPA treatment was sufficient to induce PPI dysfunction. Rats were also monitored for LID development, using the abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) test, to examine PPI and LID associations. In experiment 2, Vilazodone (VZD), a serotonin transporter (SERT) blocker and 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)) partial agonist was administered to test its potential efficacy in reducing LID and PPI dysfunction. Once testing was complete, tissue was collected for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to examine the monoamine levels in motor and non-motor circuits. Results indicate that bilateral DA lesions produced motor deficits and that chronic L-DOPA induced moderate AIMs; importantly, rats that developed more severe AIMs were more likely to display sensorimotor gating dysfunction. In addition, VZD treatment dose-dependently reduced L-DOPA-induced AIMs without impairing L-DOPA efficacy, although VZD's effects on PPI were limited. Altogether, this project established the bilateral 6-OHDA lesion model accurately portrayed LID and PDAP-like behaviors, uncovered their potential relationship, and finally, demonstrated the utility of VZD for reducing LID.",,United States,2023,10.1016/j.nbd.2022.105965,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",5-HT1A and Bilateral and LID and PD and PDAP and PPI and SERT,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36526089

Here, we show that a decrease in the activity of the serotonin transporter (SERT) accelerates MV remodeling and progression to MR. Through studies of a population of patients with MR, we show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use and SERT promoter polymorphism 5-HTTLPR LL genotype were associated with MV surgery at younger age. Functional characterization of 122 human MV samples, in conjunction with in vivo studies in SERT(-/-) mice and wild-type mice treated with the SSRI fluoxetine, showed that diminished SERT activity in MV interstitial cells (MVICs) contributed to the pathophysiology of MR through enhanced serotonin receptor (HTR) signaling. SERT activity was decreased in LL MVICs partially because of diminished membrane localization of SERT. In mice, fluoxetine treatment or SERT knockdown resulted in thickened MV leaflets. Similarly, silencing of SERT in normal human MVICs led to up-regulation of transforming growth factor Î²1 (TGFÎ²1) and collagen (COL1A1) in the presence of serotonin. In addition, treatment of MVICs with fluoxetine not only directly inhibited SERT activity but also decreased SERT expression and increased HTR2B expression. Fluoxetine treatment and LL genotype were also associated with increased COL1A1 expression in the presence of serotonin in MVICs, and these effects were attenuated by HTR2B inhibition. These results suggest that assessment of both 5-HTTLPR genotype and SERT-inhibiting treatments may be useful tools to risk-stratify patients with MV disease to estimate the likelihood of rapid disease progression.",,United States,2023,10.1126/scitranslmed.adc9606,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36599005

Changes in neurochemical transmission are important mechanisms of antidepressant therapies. Here, we review the preclinical DBS literature reporting behavioural and neurochemical data associated with its antidepressant-like effects. The most commonly studied target in preclinical models was the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). In rodents, DBS delivered to this target induced serotonin (5-HT) release and increased 5-HT1(B) receptor expression. The antidepressant-like effects of vmPFC DBS seemed to be independent of the serotonin transporter and potentially mediated by the direct modulation of prefrontal projections to the raphe. Adenosinergic and glutamatergic transmission might have also play a role. Medial forebrain bundle (MFB) DBS increased dopamine levels and reduced D2 receptor expression, whereas nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and lateral habenula (LHb) stimulation increased catecholamine levels in different brain regions. In rodents, subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS induced robust depression-like responses associated with a reduction in serotonergic transmission, as revealed by a decrease in serotonin release. Some of these effects seemed to be mediated by 5HT1(A) receptors. In conclusion, the antidepressant-like effects of DBS in preclinical models have been well documented in multiple targets. Though variable mechanisms have been proposed, DBS-induced acute and long-term changes in neurochemical substrates seem to play an important role in the antidepressant-like effects of this therapy.",,Netherlands,2023,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2022.12.003,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",Animal models and Catecholamine and Deep brain stimulation and Depression and Glutamate and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36640729

We found that 24 h after a social defeat, accumbal dopamine responses, evoked by a high frequency electrical stimulation of the ventral tegmental area, were more profound in socially defeated rats in comparison with non-defeated control animals. The enhanced dopamine release was associated with the prolonged immobility time in the forced swim test. The use of the dopamine depletion protocol revealed no alteration in the reduction and recovery of the amplitude of dopamine release following social defeat stress. However, administration of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, raclopride (2 mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant increase of the electrically evoked dopamine release in both groups of animals, nevertheless exhibiting less manifested effect in the defeated rats comparing to control animals. Taken together, our data demonstrated profound alterations in the dopamine transmission in the association with depressive-like behavior following a single exposure to stressful environment.

Here, therefore, we investigated derivatives of TMCA (dTMCA) for their anxiolytic effects using immobilization and electric shock-induced stress in rats. Derivatives of TMCA ameliorated anxiety in mice and rats revealed by extended period of time spent in the open arms of elevated plus maze. Stress-mediated repression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression in the amygdala regions of rat brain and dopamine levels in the PC12 cells was restored by two selected derivatives (TMCA#5 and TMCA#9). Unlike TH expression, stress-induced protein expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) was unaffected by both derivatives in rats. Given the preferential inhibitory activity of dTMCA on dopamine and serotonin receptors, serotonergic road map of cellular signaling could be their target for anxiolytic effects.

In this context, the trace aminergic system may link together sex, diet and inflammation. Utilising a zebrafish larval model of GI inflammation, the current study aimed to investigate mechanisms by which excess amounts of trace amines (TAs) may influence GI health. In addition, we probed the potential role of 17Î²-estradiol (E2) and its receptors, given the known female-predominance of many GI disorders. To assess GI functionality and integrity, live imaging techniques (neutral red staining) and post-mortem immunofluorescent staining of tight junction proteins (occludin and ZO-1) were analyzed respectively. In addition, behavioural assays, as an indication of overall wellbeing, as well as whole body H(2)O(2) and prostaglandin E2 assays were performed to inform on oxidative and inflammatory status. Excess Î²-phenethylamine (PEA), tryptamine (TRP) and Ï-tyramine (TYR) resulted in adverse GI and systemic effects. In this regard, clear beneficial effects of E2 to modulate the effects of PEA, TRP and TYR was evident. Moreover, agmatine displayed potential protective effects on GI epithelium and whole body oxidative status, however, potential to induce systemic inflammation suggests the importance of dosage and administration optimisation. Taken together, TYR seems like the most prominent TA to have damaging GI effects, feasibly exacerbating GI inflammation. In this context, the relative lack of E2 may provide mechanistic insights into the reported female-predominance of GI disorders. Moreover, an effective therapeutic in this context may be required to maintain GI TA load despite fluctuating E2 levels.",,United States,2023,10.1016/j.taap.2023.116399,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Agmatine and Female-predominance and IBS and Inflammation and Oxidative stress and Trace amines,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36716863

D(2)R are highly expressed in the striatum, where they form heteromers with the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R). Changes in the density of A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromers have been reported in postmortem tissue from patients with schizophrenia, but the degree to which A(2)R are involved in schizophrenia and the effect of antipsychotic drugs is unknown. Here, we examine the effect of exposure to three prototypical antipsychotic drugs on A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromerization in mammalian cells using a NanoBiT assay. After 16Â h of exposure, a significant increase in the density of A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromers was found with haloperidol and aripiprazole, but not with clozapine. On the other hand, clozapine, but not haloperidol or aripiprazole, was associated with a significant decrease in A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromerization after 2Â h of treatment. Computational binding models of these compounds revealed distinctive molecular signatures that explain their different influence on heteromerization. The bulky tricyclic moiety of clozapine displaces TM 5 of D(2)R, inducing a clash with A(2A)R, while the extended binding mode of haloperidol and aripiprazole stabilizes a specific conformation of the second extracellular loop of D(2)R that enhances the interaction with A(2A)R. It is proposed that an increase in A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromerization is involved in the extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) of antipsychotics and that the specific clozapine-mediated destabilization of A(2A)R-D(2)R heteromerization can explain its low EPS liability.",,France,2023,10.1016/j.biopha.2023.114327,Journal Article,Adenosine A(2A) receptor and Aripiprazole and Clozapine and Dopamine D(2) receptor and Haloperidol and Receptor heteromerization,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-36736280

Among the 5-HT receptors, serotonin-6 (5-HT(6)) receptor has been an area of substantial research. 5-HT(6) receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor mediating its effects through diverse signaling pathways. Exceptional features of the receptors fueling drug discovery efforts include unique localization and specific distribution in the brain regions having a role in learning, memory, mood, and behavior, and the affinity of several clinically used psychotropic agents. Although non-clinical data suggest that both agonist and antagonist may have similar behavioral effects, most of the agents that entered clinical evaluation were antagonists. Schizophrenia was the initial target; more recently, cognitive deficits associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other neurological disorders has been the target for clinically evaluated 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists. Several 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists (idalopirdine, intepirdine and latrepirdine) showed efficacy in alleviating cognitive deficits associated with AD in the proof-of-concept clinical studies; however, the outcomes of the subsequent phase 3 studies were largely disappointing.

Transgenic mice as well as the rat/monkey models established by perinatal challenges of EGF or its homologs consistently exhibit various behavioral endophenotypes relevant to schizophrenia. In particular, post-pubertal elevation in baseline dopaminergic activity may illustrate the abnormal behaviors relevant to positive and negative symptoms as well as to the timing of this behavioral onset.

Serotonin, also called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter that has been associated with MDMA-induced prosocial effects. However, the detailed neural mechanisms remain elusive. In the present study, we investigated whether 5-HT neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) is involved in MDMA-induced prosocial effects using the social approach test in male ICR mice. Systemic administration of (S)-citalopram, a selective 5-HT transporter inhibitor, before administration of MDMA failed to suppress MDMA-induced prosocial effects. On the other hand, systemic administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100635, but not 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), or 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist, significantly suppressed MDMA-induced prosocial effects. Furthermore, local administration of WAY100635 into the BLA but not into the mPFC suppressed MDMA-induced prosocial effects. Consistent with this finding, intra-BLA MDMA administration significantly increased sociability.

Inhibiting norepinephrine and serotonin transporters at presynaptic terminals raises extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine. The Î±1- and Î±2-adrenergic receptor agonists inhibit glutamatergic input from primary afferent nerves to the spinal dorsal horn. However, the contribution of spinal Î±1- and Î±2-adrenergic receptors to the analgesic effect of antidepressants and associated synaptic plasticity remains uncertain. In this study, we showed that systemic administration of duloxetine or amitriptyline acutely reduced tactile allodynia and mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia caused by spinal nerve ligation in rats. In contrast, duloxetine or amitriptyline had no effect on nociception in sham rats. Blocking Î±1-adrenergic receptors with WB-4101 or Î±2-adrenergic receptors with yohimbine at the spinal level diminished the analgesic effect of systemically administered duloxetine and amitriptyline. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of duloxetine or amitriptyline similarly attenuated pain hypersensitivity in nerve-injured rats; the analgesic effect was abolished by intrathecal pretreatment with both WB-4101 and yohimbine. In addition, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in spinal cord slices showed that duloxetine or amitriptyline rapidly inhibited dorsal root-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in dorsal horn neurons in nerve-injured rats but had no such effect in sham rats. The inhibitory effect of duloxetine and amitriptyline was abolished by the WB-4101 and yohimbine combination. Therefore, antidepressants attenuate neuropathic pain predominantly by inhibiting primary afferent input to the spinal cord via activating both Î±1- and Î±2-adrenergic receptors.

Dopaminergic-related dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) may be a hidden antidepressant mechanism of EA, where dopamine transporter (DAT) plays an essential role. This study aimed to investigate the synaptic transmission and DAT-related changes of EA in depression. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 3-week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The successfully modeled rats were then randomly and equally assigned to CUMS, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and EA or SSRIâ€‰+â€‰EA groups, followed by a 2-week treatment respectively. After monitoring body weight and behavioral tests of all rats, the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) tissue was collected for electrophysiology and the expression detection of DAT, phosphorylated DAT (p-DAT), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), protein kinase A (PKA), and trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1). RESULTS: Depressive-like behaviors induced by CUMS were alleviated by EA, SSRI, and SSRIâ€‰+â€‰EA treatments through behavioral tests. Compared with CUMS group, EA improved synaptic transmission in vmPFC by upregulating spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents amplitude. Molecularly, EA reversed the increased total DAT and p-DAT expression as well as the decreased ratio of p-DAT/total DAT along with the activation of TAAR1, cAMP, and PKA in vmPFC. CONCLUSION: We speculated that the antidepressant effect of EA was associated with enhanced synaptic transmission in vmPFC, and the upregulated phosphorylation of DAT relevant to TAAR1, cAMP, and PKA may be the potential mechanism.",,England,2023,10.1111/cns.14200,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",depression and dopamine transporter and electroacupuncture and electrophysiology and trace amine-associated receptor 1,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37002793

Alterations in dopaminergic transmission contribute to pathological drug-seeking behavior and other symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal following drug discontinuation, making drug abstinence challenging and contributing to high rates of relapse among those suffering from substance use disorder. Recently, the use of dopamine partial agonists has been proposed as a potential strategy to restore dopaminergic signalling during drug withdrawal, while avoiding the adverse side effects associated with stronger modulators of dopaminergic transmission. We investigated the effects of the atypical antipsychotic brexpiprazole, which is a partial agonist at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, in a mouse model of opioid dependence. The development of opioid dependence in mice is characterized by locomotor sensitization, analgesic tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and drug-seeking behavior. We set up four paradigms to model the effects of brexpiprazole on each of these adaptations that occur during chronic opioid use in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Concomitant treatment of brexpiprazole during chronic morphine administration attenuated the development of locomotor sensitization. Brexpiprazole treatment abolished morphine place preference and blocked reinstatement of this behavior following extinction. Brexpiprazole treatment did not alter morphine analgesia, nor did it impact the development of morphine tolerance. However, brexpiprazole treatment did prevent the expression of opioid-induced hyperalgesia in a tail-withdrawal assay, while failing to improve somatic withdrawal symptoms. Altogether, these results provide preclinical evidence for the efficacy of brexpiprazole as a modulator of dopamine-dependent behaviors during opioid use and withdrawal.",,England,2023,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2023.109546,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37068603

After intravenous 3H-spiperone (3H-SP) administration to rats with unilateral nigral lesions, we found no differences in accumulation of total or particulate-bound 3H-SP in dopamine-denervated compared with intact striata. 3H-SP in vivo binds to less than 10% of striatal sites labeled by 3H-SP incubated with striatal particulate preparations in vitro. Quantitative autoradiography of 3H-SP binding to striatal sections in vitro also failed to reveal any effects of dopamine denervation. 3H-SP bound to striatal sites in vivo dissociates more slowly than that bound to striatal particulate preparations labeled in vitro. Striatal binding properties of 3H-SP administered in vivo are quite different from the same kinetic binding parameters estimated in vitro using crude membrane preparations of striatum. In addition, striatal binding of in vivo-administered 3H-SP is not affected by prior lesion of the substantia nigra, which results in profound ipsilateral striatal dopamine depletion. Thus, behavioral supersensitivity to dopaminergic compounds may not be associated with altered striatal binding properties for dopamine receptor ligands in vivo.",,United States,1986,10.1002/ana.410190412,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3707090

Herein, we explored the antidepressant effect and its possible neurobiological mechanisms in animal models. In present study, AF-5 administration markedly decreased the immobility time in mouse forced swim test and tail suspension test. In the sub-chronic reserpine-induced depressive rats, AF-5 treatment markedly increased the rectal temperature and decreased the immobility time of model rats. In addition, chronic AF-5 treatment markedly reversed the depressive-like behaviors in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats by reducing immobility time of forced swim test. Single treatment with AF-5 also potentiated the mouse head-twitch response induced by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, a metabolic precursor to serotonin), and antagonized the ptosis and motor ability triggered by reserpine. However, AF-5 had no effect on yohimbine toxicity in mice. These results indicated that acute treatment with AF-5 produced serotonergic, but not noradrenergic activation. Furthermore, AF-5 reduced adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level in serum and normalized the neurotransmitter changes, including the decreased serotonin (5-HT) in hippocampus of CUMS rats. Moreover, AF-5 affected the expressions of CRFR1 and 5-HT2C receptor in CUMS rats. These findings confirm the antidepressant effect of AF-5 in animal models, which may be primarily related to CRFR1 and 5-HT2C receptor.

A behavioral index of cognitive flexibility was assessed prior to PET imaging. Hormonal contraceptive users exhibited greater DA synthesis capacity than NC participants, particularly in dorsal caudate, and greater cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, across individuals, the magnitude of striatal DA synthesis capacity was associated with cognitive flexibility. No group differences were observed in D2/3 receptor binding or DA release. Analyses by sex alone may obscure underlying differences in DA synthesis tied to women's hormone status. Hormonal contraception (in the form of pill, shot, implant, ring, or intrauterine device) is used by ~400 million women worldwide, yet few studies have examined whether chronic hormonal manipulations impact basic properties of the DA system.

After treatment for 3 and 12 months with haloperidol or clozapine but not sulpiride, striatal acetylcholine levels were increased. Striatal choline acetyltransferase activity was not altered by any drug treatment. Vmax for striatal acetylcholinesterase activity during the course of 12 months' treatment with haloperidol or clozapine, but not with sulpiride, tended to increase; Km was not altered by any drug treatment. Bmax for specific striatal [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was not altered by haloperidol or sulpiride treatment but was transiently elevated after 6 months of clozapine treatment, thereafter returning to control levels. Kd was not altered by any drug treatment. These findings indicate that alterations in striatal acetylcholine content caused by chronic treatment with some but not all neuroleptics are due to changes in cholinergic neuronal activity rather than neurotransmitter synthesis or destruction. The effects of haloperidol but not those of clozapine may be related to the emergence of functional striatal dopamine receptor supersensitivity.

However, the effects of CA on immobility induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) in a mouse model and 5-HT receptor activity have not been investigated. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We investigated the antagonistic effects of VBL, NET-D1602, and the three components of GÎ±s protein-coupled 5-HT receptors. Additionally, we identified the effects and mechanism of action of CA, the active component of NET-D1602, in the CRS-exposed model. METHODS: For in vitro analyses, we used 1321N1 cells stably expressing human 5-HT(6) receptors and CHO-K1 expressing human 5-HT(4) or 5-HT(7) receptors cell lines to study the mechanism of action. For in vivo analyses, CRS-exposed mice were orally administered CA (10, 50, or 100Â mg/kg) daily for 21 consecutive days. The effects of CA were analyzed by assessing behavioral changes using a forced swim test (FST), measuring levels of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-related hormones in ntial therapeutic effects as 5-HT6 receptor antagonists for neurodegenerative diseases and depressioserum, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), monoamines, including 5-HT, dopamine, and norepinephrine, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The underlying molecular mechanisms of the serotonin transporter (SERT), monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mTORC1 signaling were detected using western blotting. RESULTS: CA was confirmed to be an active component in the antagonistic effects of NET-D1602 on 5-HT(6) receptor activity through decreases in cAMP and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Moreover, CRS-exposed mice treated with CA showed a significantly reduced immobility time in the FST. CA also significantly decreased corticosterone, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels. CA enhanced 5-HT, dopamine, and norepinephrine levels in the hippocampus (HC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) but decreased MAO-A and SERT protein levels. Similarly, CA significantly upregulated the ERK, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Akt/mTOR/p70S6K/S6 signaling pathways in both HC and the PFC.

Compared with the conditions in model group, the sugar preference, the number of entries and time spent in the center of open, total distance of movement, and the number of entries and proportion of time spent in open arm in treatment groups were increased while the number and time of immobility in forced swimming experiment were decreased; the serum contents of IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± and the expression of caspase-3 were down regulated, while the contents of BDNF and 5-HT, the activities of SOD and CAT in hippocampal CA1 region, the expressions of NGF, BDNF, p-TrkB/TrkB, p-CREB/CREB, HO-1, Bcl-2/Bax, and Nrf2 nuclear translocation were enhanced. In conclusion, SLKX might regulate the Nrf2 nucleus translocation by activating BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway, lower oxidative stress damage in hippocampus, inhibit caspase-3 activity, and reduce apoptosis of hippocampal nerve cells, thereby playing an antidepressant role.",,China,2023,10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20221114.402,English Abstract and Journal Article,BDNF/TrkB/CREB pathway and Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and Shenling Kaixin Granules and caspase-3 pathway and chronic unpredictable mild stress(CUMS) and depression,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37282906

Forebrain serotonin (5-HT) transmission has been implicated in ASD-related behavioral alterations. In this study, we assessed 5-HT signals and the functional responsiveness in BTBR mice compared to standard C57BL/6J (B6) control mice to elucidate how 5-HT alterations contribute to behavioral abnormalities in BTBR mice. A lower number of 5-HT neurons in the median raphe, but not in the dorsal raphe, was observed in male and female BTBR mice. Acute systemic injection of buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, induced c-Fos in several brain regions in both B6 and BTBR mice; however, blunted c-Fos induction in BTBR mice was documented in the cingulate cortex, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral hippocampus (Hipp). Decreased c-Fos responses in these regions are associated with a lack of buspirone effects on anxiety-like behavior in BTBR mice. Analysis of mRNA expression following acute buspirone injection indicated that 5HTR1a gene downregulation (or upregulation) occurred in the BLA and Hipp of B6 mice, respectively, but not BTBR mice. The mRNA expression of factors associated with neurogenesis or the pro-inflammatory state was not consistently altered by acute buspirone injection. Therefore, 5-HT responsivity via 5-HT1A receptors in the BLA and Hipp are linked to anxiety-like behavior, in which circuits are disrupted in BTBR mice. Other distinct 5-HT circuits from the BLA and Hipp that regulate social behavior are restricted but preserved in BTBR mice.",,England,2023,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2023.109634,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Autism and Basolateral amygdala and Hippocampus and Raphe nuclei and Serotonin,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37301467

In this study, we used PET imaging in nine drug-naÃ¯ve female cynomolgus monkeys to determine if baseline measures of DAT, with [(18)F]FECNT, and D2/D3R availability, with [(11)C]raclopride, in the caudate nucleus, putamen and ventral striatum were associated with rates of cocaine self-administration and if these measures changed during long-term (~13 months) cocaine self-administration and following time-off (3-9 months) from cocaine. Cocaine (0.2â€‰mg/kg/injection) and 1.0â€‰g food pellets were available under a multipleÂ fixed-interval (FI) 3-min schedule of reinforcement. In contrast to what has been observed in male monkeys, baseline D2/D3R availability was positively correlated with rates of cocaine self-administration only during the first week of exposure; DAT availability did not correlate with cocaine self-administration. D2/D3R availability decreased ~20% following cumulative intakes of 100 and 1000â€‰mg/kg cocaine; DAT availability did not significantly change. These reductions in D2/D3R availability did not recover over 9 months of time-off from cocaine. To determine if these reductions were reversible, three monkeys were implanted with osmotic pumps that delivered raclopride for 30 days.Â We found that chronic treatment with the D2/D3R antagonist raclopride increased D2/D3R availability in the ventral striatum but not in the other regions when compared to baseline levels. Over 13 months of self-administration, tolerance did not develop to the rate-decreasing effects of self-administered cocaine on food-reinforced responding, but number of injections and cocaine intake significantly increased over the 13 months. These data extend previous findings to female monkeys and suggest sex differences in the relationship between D2/D3R availability related to vulnerability and long-term cocaine use.",,England,2023,10.1038/s41386-023-01622-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37349473

Antipsychotic drugs are thought to re-balance this output by blocking D2 receptors (D2Rs). In this study, we found that amphetamine-driven dopamine release unbalanced D1-SPN and D2-SPN Ca(2+) activity in mice, but that antipsychotic efficacy was associated with the reversal of abnormal D1-SPN, rather than D2-SPN, dynamics, even for drugs that are D2R selective or lacking any dopamine receptor affinity. By contrast, a clinically ineffective drug normalized D2-SPN dynamics but exacerbated D1-SPN dynamics under hyperdopaminergic conditions. Consistent with antipsychotic effect, selective D1-SPN inhibition attenuated amphetamine-driven changes in locomotion, sensorimotor gating and hallucination-like perception. Notably, antipsychotic efficacy correlated with the selective inhibition of D1-SPNs only under hyperdopaminergic conditions-a dopamine-state-dependence exhibited by D1R partial agonism but not non-antipsychotic D1R antagonists.

This study investigated striatal local field potential (LFP) oscillation and locomotor activity following treatments with morphine, a DA release enhancer, and haloperidol (HAL), a DA D2 receptor (D2R) antagonist in mice. After intracranial electrodes were placed into the dorsal striatum of male Swiss albino ICR mice, intraperitoneal injections of morphine or HAL were administered. LFP signals and spontaneous motor activity were recorded simultaneously. The results showed that morphine significantly increased locomotor speed, both low (30.3-44.9 Hz) and high (60.5-95.7 Hz) LFP gamma powers and delta (1-4 Hz)â€‘gamma (30.3-95.7 Hz) phaseâ€‘amplitude coupling. In contrast, HAL treatments were found to significantly decrease these parameters. Moreover, regression analyses also revealed significant positive correlations between locomotor speed and high gamma powers. Taken together, these results demonstrate opposite LFP oscillations in the dorsal striatum with low and high gamma activities, and deltaâ€‘gamma couplings in response to a DA release enhancer and D2R antagonist by morphine and HAL, respectively.

Alcohol, however, is rarely consumed in pure form but in fruit- or corn-derived preparations, like beer. These preparations add other compounds to the consumption, which may critically modify alcohol intake and AUD risk. We investigated the effects of hordenine, a barley-derived beer compound on alcohol use-related behaviours. We found that the dopamine D2 receptor agonist hordenine (50â€‰mg/kg) limited ongoing alcohol consumption and prophylactically diminished relapse drinking after withdrawal in mice. Although not having reinforcing effects on its own, hordenine blocked the establishment of alcohol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). However, it independently enhanced alcohol CPP retrieval. Hordenine had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on locomotor activity. Chronic hordenine exposure enhanced monoamine tissue levels in many brain regions. Further characterization revealed monoaminergic binding sites of hordenine and found a strong binding on the serotonin and dopamine transporters, and dopamine D(3) , and adrenergic Î±(1A) and Î±(2A) receptor activation but no effects on GABA(A) receptor or glycinergic signalling.

Currently, there are no defined therapeutic protocols to manage psychosis in TLE patients, as antipsychotic agents may induce epileptic seizures and are associated with severe side effects and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions with antiepileptic drugs. Thus, novel treatment strategies are necessary. Several lines of evidence suggest that hippocampal hyperactivity is central to the pathology of both TLE and psychosis; therefore, restoring hippocampal activity back to normal levels may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating psychosis in TLE. In rodent models, increased activity in the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) results in aberrant dopamine system function, which is thought to underlie symptoms of psychosis. Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that targeting Î±5-containing Î³-aminobutyric acid receptors (Î±5GABA(A)Rs), an inhibitory receptor abundant in the hippocampus, with positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), can restore dopamine system function in rodent models displaying hippocampal hyperactivity. Thus, we posited that Î±5-PAMs may be beneficial in a model used to study TLE. Here, we demonstrate that pilocarpine-induced TLE is associated with increased VTA dopamine neuron activity, an effect that was completely reversed by intra-vHipp administration of GL-II-73, a selective Î±5-PAM. Further, pilocarpine did not alter the hippocampal Î±5GABA(A)R expression or synaptic localization that may affect the efficacy of Î±5-PAMs. Taken together, these results suggest augmenting Î±5GABA(A)R function as a novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of psychosis in TLE.",,Switzerland,2023,10.3390/ijms241411588,Journal Article,dopamine and electrophysiology and temporal lobe epilepsy,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-37511346

Serotonin binding was lowest during the early afternoon of proestrus and highest during the afternoon of estrus with diestrous values in between. The high estrous values were associated with a significant increase in Bmax and a decrease in Kd. However, the increase in binding actually took place during the late afternoon of proestrus, when there was a rapid increase in binding from noon to 18.00 h. Binding remained at this elevated level throughout the next day. There were no changes in the binding of [3H]ketanserin or [3H]spiroperidol to cortical membranes during the estrous cycle, so the differential binding of [3H]5-HT is most likely the result of variations in 5-HT1 rather than 5-HT2 receptors.

Gut microbiota is causatively linked with the development of both metabolic dysfunctions and gastrointestinal disorders, thus gut dysbiosis in IBS may contribute to the development of metabolic syndrome.

We show levels of R. gnavus, tryptamine, and phenethylamine are positively associated with insulin resistance in T2D patients and IBS patients. Monoassociation of R. gnavus impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose control in germ-free mice. Mechanistically, treatment of R. gnavus-derived metabolites tryptamine and phenethylamine directly impair insulin signaling in major metabolic tissues of healthy mice and monkeys and this effect is mediated by the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling axis.

Anterior pituitaries from ovariectomized rats were incubated for short periods in medium 199, with or without the steroid. Dopamine (DA) receptors in partially purified pituitary membranes were quantified by equilibrium binding using [3H]spiperone; the PRL released into the incubation medium was analyzed by RIA. Addition of 10(-10) to 10(-6) M 17 beta E2 to the incubation medium of anterior pituitaries rapidly and reversibly decreased the number of DA receptors (P less than 0.01 to 0.001), while increasing PRL release, in a dose-related fashion. The maximal effect on both receptor numbers and PRL secretion was obtained with 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. This effect involved no change in receptor affinity (Kd = 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM in presence or in absence of 17 beta E2). This estrogen-induced decrease in DA-binding capacity was apparently not the result of the occupation of spiperone binding sites by the steroid, since after a 30-min incubation with 10(-8) M [3H]17 beta E2, no radioactivity was detectable on the partially purified membranes. Moreover, the presence of 17 beta E2 at the same time as the labeled D2 ligand did not modify the kinetics of association or dissociation of spiperone with pituitary membranes. This decrease in anterior pituitary DA receptor content and the increase in PRL release were already significant after a 7-min incubation in the presence of 10(-8) M 17 beta E2. Finally, these effects of 17 beta E2 were not mimicked by its 17 alpha-stereoisomer, nor by progesterone, or testosterone. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of 17 beta E2 on PRL secretion may be due, at least in part, to the desensitization of anterior pituitary cells to DA. The steroid may produce this desensitization directly by decreasing the number of D2. The short latency of this effect likely discards the possibility of a genomic action of 17 beta E2.",,United States,1986,10.1210/endo-119-6-2484,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3780536

Spinal 5-HT release is apparently modulated by an autoreceptor. Exogenous 5-HT depressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, the K+-stimulated release of [3H]5-HT. Similarly, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produced a concentration-dependent decrease in [3H]5-HT release. Methiothepin and quipazine blocked the inhibition of release induced by exogenous 5-HT. The 5-HT2 receptor antagonists spiperone and ketanserin failed to alter the action of 5-HT at the spinal 5-HT autoreceptor. Spiperone and ketanserin were shown, however, to alter the storage of [3H]5-HT. When used in concentrations greater than 10 nM, the drugs evoked increases in basal [3H]5-HT and [3H]5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid ( [3H]5-HIAA) effluxes which were independent of the presence of calcium ions. A good agreement existed between the potencies of drugs for modifying autoreceptor function and their abilities to compete for high-affinity [3H]5-HT binding in the spinal cord (designated 5-HT1). Furthermore quipazine, in concentrations that preferentially interact with the 5-HT1B subtype, antagonized the actions of exogenous 5-HT on K+-stimulated release. Spiperone, in a concentration that approximated the affinity constant of 5-HT1A sites for the drug, was ineffective in altering the ability of exogenous 5-HT to modulate K+-stimulated [3H]5-HT release. These results suggest that 5-HT1B sites are associated with serotonergic autoreceptor function in the spinal cord.",,England,1985,10.1111/j.1471-4159.1985.tb10548.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3877146

To test this hypothesis further, haloperidol (0.5 microliter of a 7 nM sol.), propranolol (0.5 microliter of a 175 nM sol.) or isotonic saline (0.5 microliter) were injected 1.5 h, 24 h and 48 h after the injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA; 2 microliter of 8 micrograms/microliters) into the lateral hypothalamus (LH) of Sprague-Dawley rats to determine if the hypothermia, motor impairment and consummatory deficits could be reversed. Although haloperidol injection significantly enhanced the hypothermia seen 1.5 h after 6-OHDA injection, open field performance and consummatory responses were significantly improved after haloperidol was injected into the LH where accumulation is known to occur. Three consecutive days of intracerebral haloperidol treatment produced a recovery of body weight regulation lasting for 6 days. Treatment with propranolol enhanced open field performance 1 day after 6-OHDA injection but failed to enhance recovery of consummatory behaviour and body weight control. These results suggest that CA released from areas of accumulation act on adjacent CA receptors to participate in the production of behavioural deficits previously attributed only to the loss of functional neurotransmitter in terminal fields in the forebrain.",,Netherlands,1985,10.1016/0166-4328(85)90057-9,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3922388

A proposal for a strategy to improve the quality of life in senescence.,Knoll J ,Mechanisms of ageing and development,,"In the aging brain there is a loss of neurons compensated for by a proliferation of glial cells. Because of the increased B-type monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity present in the glia, dopaminergic and 'trace aminergic' modulation in the brain declines in senescence. The significant increase of the incidence of depression in the elderly, the age-dependent decline in male sexual vigor and the frequent appearance of parkinsonian symptoms in the latter decades of life might be attributed to a decrease of dopamine and 'trace amines' in the brain. The outlines of a drug strategy to counteract these biochemical lesions of aging by chronic administration of (-)deprenyl (Jumex, Eldepryl), a selective inhibitor of B-type MAO, which facilitates dopaminergic and 'trace-aminergic' activity in the brain, are forwarded. The restitution and long-term maintenance of full scale sexual activity in aged male rats continuously treated with (-)deprenyl and the clinical observation that this drug prolongs in a statistically significant manner, the duration of the Parkinson's disease support the view that (-)deprenyl may improve deteriorating functions due to dopamine deficiency in the aging brain.",,Ireland,1985,10.1016/0047-6374(85)90001-6,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3927074

Naturally occurring analogs of amphetamine (AMPH) such as beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tyramine (TYR) and octopamine (OCT) are present in trace amounts in the brain of several species. We have studied in this model, in comparison with AMPH, the effects of beta-PEA, TYR and OCT, in order to explore if their central effects are mediated through an action involving dopaminergic nerve terminals or whether they activate a specific receptor directly. In contrast to the results obtained with AMPH, in the absence of inhibition of monoamine oxidase activity, the three amines beta-PEA (0.1-10 microM), TYR (0.1-10 microM) and OCT (10 microM) did not affect the electrically evoked release of [3H]ACh. On the other hand, in the presence of pargyline (10 microM), the three amines inhibited the electrically evoked release of [3H]ACh and all subsequent experiments were carried out in the presence of pargyline. After pretreatment with reserpine (5 mg/kg s.c., 24 h), which results in a 95% depletion of the endogenous dopamine content, OCT lost its inhibitory effect on [3H]ACh release, whereas beta-PEA and TYR still inhibited the electrically evoked release of [3H]ACh. Reserpine pretreatment (5 mg/kg s.c., 24 h) combined with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (300 mg/kg i.p., 2 h) reduced endogenous dopamine levels by 99.9%, but, under these conditions, beta-PEA, TYR and AMPH still retained their inhibitory effect on [3H]ACh, release. These inhibitory effects of beta-PEA and AMPH on [3H] ACh release were antagonized by S-sulpiride (0.1 microM). In striatal slices from untreated rats, the inhibition of [3H]ACh released by beta-PEA (30 microM), TYR (30 microM) or AMPH (10 microM) was abolished completely after a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic system. The present data indicate that in order to inhibit the release of [3H]ACh from rat striatal slices in vitro, OCT requires the integrity of vesicular stores of dopamine. On the other hand, beta-PEA, TYR and AMPH are still active when the dopamine levels are depleted, although they require the integrity of the dopaminergic nerve terminal. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase is essential to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of exogenous beta-PEA, TYR and OCT on cholinergic transmission. Our results indicate that a hypothesis concerning a possible physiopathological role of endogenous beta-PEA or TYR should involve concomitant changes in monoamine oxidase activity.",,United States,1985,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3930699

Selective supersensitivity of these receptors (defined as an increase in Bmax) was induced by means of intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in animals pretreated with desmethylimipramine (DMI). Supersensitivity was also produced by the chronic administration of haloperidol. The supersensitivity of DA receptors induced by 6-OHDA was found to be associated with a reduced hypothermic response to apomorphine. Supersensitivity elicited by the chronic administration of haloperidol, which very probably did not produce a specific effect on the density of DA receptors but also affected serotonergic receptors, did not elicit any change in hypothermia induced by apomorphine. The results of the present study are not consistent with the view that DA receptors mediate hypothermia per se, but rather suggest that hypothermia induced by DA agonists is more complex, probably involving serotonergic receptors primarily, though other factors may also be contributory. Furthermore, the results of the present study suggest that the functional significance of supersensitivity of DA receptors induced by 6-OHDA versus chronic treatment with haloperidol may be quite different, depending upon the effector system examined.",,England,1985,10.1016/0028-3908(85)90007-3,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-3939327

Acute oral administration of losulazine at 0.1, 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg evoked dose-related hypotensive responses in the absence of significant alterations of heart rate. Although variable, the acute hypotensive effects of losulazine were associated with both reductions of peripheral vascular resistance and reductions in cardiac output. Acute oral administration of doses of losulazine ranging from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg did not cause orthostatic hypotension. Blockade of prostaglandin synthesis and of cholinergic, beta adrenergic and histaminergic receptors did not abolish the hypotensive effect of losulazine at 1 mg/kg i.v. Ganglionic blockade abolished the hypotensive effect of losulazine (1 mg/kg i.v. and 10 mg/kg p.o.), indicating that the hypotensive activity of losulazine was dependent on the presence of sympathetic neuronal activity. Additive combination studies of losulazine and nitroprusside, phentolamine, reserpine or guanethidine implied that losulazine, reserpine and guanethidine had the same site of action, i.e., inhibition of adrenergic neuron function. A comparison of the profiles of effect of losulazine, guanethidine, guanadrel and reserpine on blood pressure, heart rate, blood pressure responses to norepinephrine and tyramine and blood pressure after desipramine pretreatment indicated that losulazine and reserpine had similar mechanisms of action.

The effects of 6-MBOA on NAT activity can be blocked by propranolol but not by prazosin, suggesting that 6-MBOA acts on the beta receptor. At the doses used 6-MBOA stimulation does not block or enhance NAT stimulation by norepinephrine, but is additive with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide which stimulates NAT activity at a site different than the beta receptor. This study demonstrates that 6-MBOA stimulates rather than inhibits melatonin biosynthesis and does not prevent stimulation of melatonin synthesis by norepinephrine. The progonadal association with eating plants containing 6-MBOA in the Montane vole may be due to over stimulation of melatonin receptor sites.

Molluscan neurones have been found to show six different types of response (three excitatory and three inhibitory) to the iontophoretic application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The pharmacological properties of the receptors and the ionic mechanisms associated with these responses have been analysed.2. Four of the responses to 5-HT (named A, A', B and C) are consequent upon an increase in membrane conductance whereas the other two (named alpha and beta) are caused by a decrease in membrane conductance.3. The A-response to 5-HT consists of a ;fast' depolarization due to an increase mainly in Na(+)-conductance; the A'-response is a ;slow' depolarization also associated with a Na(+)-conductance increase. Receptors mediating the A- and A'-depolarizations have different pharmacological properties and may exist side by side on the same neurone.4. Both the B- and C-responses are inhibitory. The B-response is a ;slow' hyperpolarization due to an increase in K(+)-conductance, the C-response is a fast hyperpolarization associated with an increase in Cl(-)-conductance.5. The alpha-response to 5-HT is a depolarization which becomes reduced in amplitude with cell hyperpolarization and reverses at -75 mV; it is caused by a decrease in K(+)-conductance. The beta-response is an hyperpolarization which increases in amplitude with cell hyperpolarization and reverses at -20/-30 mV. It results from a decrease in conductance to both Na(+) and K(+) ions.6. The receptors involved in the 5-HT responses associated with a conductance increase may be recognized by the action of specific antagonists: 7-methyltryptamine blocks only the A-receptors, 5-methoxygramine only the B-receptors and neostigmine only the C-receptors. Curare blocks the A- and C-receptors and bufotenine, the A-, A'- and B-receptors. No specific antagonists have yet been found for the 5-HT responses caused by a conductance decrease.7.

Within 1 to 5 min of the injection of L-DOPA in these inactive preparations, a stretch reflex could be elicited.4 Control experiments indicate that L-DOPA was acting centrally after decarboxylation.5DL-dihydroxyphenylserine had an inhibitory effect, without a preceding facilitation.6 When L-DOPA was preceded by diethyldithiocarbamate (i.v.) or FLA-63 (i.p.), the predominant response was a sustained facilitation, without an accompanying inhibition.7 It is concluded that in the decerebrate rat, increased stretch reflex activity is associated with increased central levels of dopamine, and decreased stretch reflex activity with increased central levels of noradrenaline.

The stimulated retinal area consisted of a central spot 1.0 mm in diameter and an annulus 2.0 mm in inner diameter and 4.0 mm in outer diameter; both forms of monochromatic stimuli were centered relative to the recording microelectrode. Each of the CA (dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline) produced an analogous effect on the hyperpolarizing response of all types of horizontal cells. The depolarizing response of the C (R/G)-type cells was found to change variably with the CA. The effect of dopamine (DA) among the CA was most pronounced when they were used at an equivalent amount. With 10--50 microM, the action of DA was variable but in general its effect was to increase slightly both center and surround responses. In some cases, however, DA initially augmented the surround and reduced the center response. Large amounts of the CA (100--200 microM) augmented the center response and attenuated the surround response considerably; these reciprocal changes usually were associated with moderate depolarization of the cells (5--10 mV). Recovery then occurred in 15--20 minutes. These results indicate that the CA, up to a certain amount, do not directly affect the transmission from photoreceptors to horizontal cells, since the center response became larger. At the same time, the lateral propagation of an S-potential appears to be selectively affected by the CA, suggesting that the adrenergic system participates in this phenomenon. When an excess of these compounds (200-500 microM) was given, the cells were rapidly depolarized to near 0 MV and eventually the light-induced responses were abolished. Large amounts (5--10 mM) of metabolic products of the CA (DOPAC and VMA) were found to reduce the center response slightly more than the surround. alpha-Methylnoradrenaline, 5-hydroxydopamine, and serotonin also caused the same but less effect on horizontal cells as did DA. Reserpine and clonidine mimicked the CA effect only if these compounds had been preceded by repeated applications of one of the CA or if the retina had been pretreated with Marplan. Propranolol, haloperidol, and apomorphine affected neither the horizontal cell membrane potential nor the CA effect. However, phentolamine in large amounts (500 microM) markedly diminished the DA action. Therefore, alpha-adrenergic receptors appear to be involved in the CA-induced changes observed in the horizontal cell response.",,United States,1979,10.1002/jnr.490040502,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-522194

The peristaltic reflex in the colon was elicited by a localized intraluminal stimulus. The contractile response of the longitudinal coat, which consists of two phases, begins before the start of propulsion. Although the contractions of the longitudinal and circular musculature are usually associated, they may be independent of each other. In particular, the longitudinal contraction does not seem to be necessary for propulsion.2. Both the longitudinal reflex contraction and the segmental responses of the circular muscle to distension, namely a contraction above and a relaxation below the bolus, are abolished by tetrodotoxin and ganglion blocking agents.3. In the guinea-pig, longitudinal and circular reflex contractions are usually resistant to antimuscarine, antihistamine and antitryptamine drugs but in the cat they are abolished by antimuscarine drugs. In both species, however, atropine and hyoscine can impair propulsion by blocking selectively the descending inhibition. In the cat, it is possible to find doses which abolish the descending inhibition without affecting the contractile responses of the longitudinal and circular muscle.4. Sympathetic denervation and pretreatment with reserpine do not affect the propulsive activity. The maintenance of the descending inhibition in denervated organs suggests that the inhibitory neurones to the circular muscle are not adrenergic.5. On the basis of the effects of drugs, the possible nervous mechanism subserving the polarity of propulsion has been examined. Such a mechanism seems to require an inhibitory pathway involving muscarinic receptors at some point.6. Pelvic nerve stimulation facilitates propulsive activity. The effect of transmural stimulation is different at low and at high frequencies of stimulation. The inhibitory effect of sympathetic stimulation on the reflex responses seems to be due mainly to an action on intrinsic nervous structures.",,England,1970,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1970.tb12897.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-5425277

Antigenic challenge of preparations obtained from passively sensitized animals induced ventricular automaticity in 1/3 of the experiments. The arrhythmogenic effects of cardiac anaphylaxis could be reproduced by exogenous histamine. Abnormal automaticity was associated with a stable diastolic membrane potential in most of the ventricular fibres and only occasionally ectopic pacemaker potentials were observed in fibres near the ventricular septum. The effective refractory period, maximum rate of depolarization of the action potential and electrical threshold were not significantly changed in ventricular anaphylaxis but in the presence of histamine the refractory time was shortened. Ventricular arrhythmias induced by histamine were increased at high extracellular Ca2+ concentrations and inhibited by Mn2+ and D 600 but were only moderately antagonized by tetrodotoxin. Pretreatment with reserpine had no effect on the abnormal automaticity. Spontaneous ventricular activity caused by histamine was markedly inhibited by the histamine H2-receptor antagonist burimamide and also by the antiarrhythmic drug, prajmalium bitartrate.

On repeated administration, this latter effect is associated with an up-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors as it occurs after electroconvulsive shock. The monoaminergic changes induced by progabide, though dissimilar from those induced by tricyclics, are probably connected with the antidepressant action on the compound observed in double-blind clinical trials. In the basal ganglia, GABA receptor agonists reduce dopamine turnover and potentiate the cataleptogenic action of neuroleptics. They also antagonize the sterotypic behaviour induced by dopaminomimetics, indicating an additional action beyond the dopamine synapse. On repeated co-administration with neuroleptics, progabide antagonizes the tolerance to the cataleptogenic action, the supersensitivity to dopaminomimetics, and the increase in 3H-spiperone binding which are caused by sustained neuroleptic treatment. This appears to be the basis for the clinical action of progabide in neuroleptic-induced dyskinesia, L-dopa-induced involuntary movements, and possibly mania. GABA receptor agonists decrease cellular excitability in several animal models and antagonize seizures, whatever their origin (GABA-mediated or GABA unrelated mechanisms). Progabide has been shown to be effective in various forms of epilepsy in double-blind and long-term clinical trials.

Guinea-pigs and rats were pretreated with reserpine for either 3 days (5 mg kg-1 i.p. at 72 h, 3 mg kg-1 at 48 h and 3 mg kg-1 at 24 h before use) or 7 days (1 mg kg-1 daily). The sensitivities of left and right atria, papillary muscles, tracheal spirals, lung strips and uteri to isoprenaline were compared with those from untreated animals. The positive inotropic responses of left atria and papillary muscles and chronotropic responses of right atria from reserpine-pretreated animals were supersensitive to isoprenaline, the concentration-response curves being to the left. The relaxation response of the carbachol-contracted trachea also exhibited supersensitivity, but to a lesser extent. However, no supersensitivity occurred for the relaxation of carbachol-contracted lungs, K+-depolarized guinea-pig uteri or electrically stimulated rat uteri. As a pharmacological index of the presence of releasable noradrenergic stores, tyramine was added cumulatively to each tissue. Only cardiac and tracheal preparations yielded substantial responses, indicating the presence of sympathetic innervation. A relaxation of the rat uterus by tyramine was not attributable to releasable noradrenaline stores. The supersensitivity of the heart and trachea could therefore be associated with their sympathetic innervation and with the fact that their responses are mediated via beta 1-adrenoceptors; the trachea containing a small proportion of beta 1-adrenoceptors. The responses of the lung and uterus, however, are beta 2-adrenoceptor-mediated and failed to exhibit supersensitivity. Since the supersensitivity is a consequence of the neuronal depleting action of reserpine, these results are compatible with the concept that beta 1-adrenoceptors are associated with sympathetic innervation whereas beta 2-adrenoceptors are not.",,Netherlands,1984,10.1016/0014-2999(84)90616-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6096155

These findings are interesting since human manganese intoxication starts with a psychiatric phase bearing similarities to schizophrenia in which the primary disturbance has been suggested to be an overactivity of dopamine neurons.

This suggests that the accumulation of DA in striatal nerve endings that normally follows GBL-induced cessation of nigrostriatal impulse flow is in reserpine-sensitive sites. Three days after a single injection of reserpine, the ability of either haloperidol, a DA receptor blocker, or GBL to enhance DA synthesis is greatly reduced and these responses recover slowly over a two week period. Similarly, the ability of haloperidol to elevate striatal DA metabolite concentrations shows a similar pattern of inhibition. The rate of recovery after reserpine of haloperidol effects on DA metabolite concentrations and the activation of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (measured in vivo by the 30 min L-DOPA accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition with NSD-1015) after either haloperidol or GBL parallels the rate of recovery of basal DA levels. The accumulation of DA after GBL proceeds for 60 min before beginning to plateau in normal rats, but 3 days after reserpine the DA elevation stops after 15 min and lasts for only 30 min in 10 day reserpinized animals. The initial 15 min accumulation of DA after GBL is the same in normal, 3 day and 10 day reserpinized rats, indicating that the initial enzymic rate of activity is the same, but the duration of activation is less. Thus, inhibition of DA storage function by reserpine alters the coupling of DA autoreceptor activity with tyrosine hydroxylase activity. It is suggested that DA storage function modulates tyrosine hydroxylase activity by controlling the amount of DA available for attachment to and inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme. This hypothesis is consistent with recent immunocytochemical observations which suggest an association of tyrosine hydroxylase with synaptic vesicles in DA neuronal terminal areas.",,Germany,1980,10.1007/BF00505803,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6111026

However we have now shown that under conditions which produce sympathetic blockade methysergide will also constrict the femoral arterial bed and the mechanism involved has been investigated. 2 Methysergide (10.100 microgram/kg i.v.) produced small but variable effects on femoral arterial blood flow in the anaesthetized dog. However following ganglion blockade (mecamylamine 5 mg/kg i.v.), section of the lumbar sympathetic chain between L4-L5 or catecholamine depletion with syrosingopine, methysergide consistently caused dose-related decreases in femoral arterial flow which were associated with increases in femoral arterial vascular resistance. 3 Intravenous infusion of methysergide (10 microgram/kg/min) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10 microgram/kg/min) inhibited the increases in femoral arterial vascular resistance produced by stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chain by 70% and 44% respectively whilst increases in vascular resistance produced by close intra-arterially administered noradrenaline were potentiated by 25% and 11% respectively 4 Our results show that the vasomotor actions of methysergide in the dog femoral arterial bed are dependent on the degree of sympathetic activity.

This review describes pharmacological and biochemical characteristics of dopamine receptors, particularly in canine caudate nucleus, which have been studied in our laboratory with a brief comparison to the current studies by other workers in similar research fields. Two distinct dopamine receptors have been characterized by means of [3H]dopamine binding to the synaptic membranes from canine caudate nucleus. One of the receptors with a Kd of about 3 muM for dopamine may be associated with adenylate cyclase and referred to as D2 receptor. The other receptor with a Kd of about 10 nM for dopamine is independent of adenylate cyclase and referred to as D2. A photochemical irreversible association of [3H]dopamine with the membraneous receptors makes it possible to separate D1 and D2 receptors from one another by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column after solubilization with Lubrol PX. On the basis of selective inhibition of [3H]dopamine binding to D1 and D2 receptors, dopamine antagonists can be classified into three classes: D1-selective (YM-09151-2), D2-selective (sulpiride) and nonselective (haloperidol, chlorpromazine). Effects of these typical antagonists on the metabolism of rat brain dopamine suggest that D1 receptor is more closely associated with the neuroleptic-induced increase in dopamine turnover. Studies with 28 benzamide derivatives and some classical neuroleptics reveal that apomorphine-induced stereotypy displays a greater association with D1 than with D2 receptors. Dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase in canine caudate nucleus can be solubilized with Lubrol PX in a sensitive form to either dopamine. Gpp(NH)p or fluoride Sephadex G-200 gel filtration separates adenylate cyclase from D1 receptors with a concomitant loss of dopamine sensitivity. Addition of the D1 receptor fraction to the adenylate cyclase restores the responsiveness to dopamine. The solubilized dopamine-unresponsive adenylate cyclase can be further separated into two distinct fractions by a batch-wise treatment with GTP-sepharose: a catalytic unit which does not respond to fluoride, and a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. The regulatory protein confers distinct responsiveness to Gpp(NH)p and fluoride upon adenylate cyclase. These results indicate that dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase is composed of at least three distinct units; D1 receptor, guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and adenylate cyclase.",,Netherlands,1982,10.1007/BF00423094,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6123940

Lesions of the olfactory receptor neurons produced in the mouse by intranasal irrigation with either ZnSO4 or Triton X-100 and in the rat by surgical deafferentation or axotomy are associated with a decrease in the levels of dopamine (DA), the DA metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the activity of the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), bulb weight and an increase in norepinephrine (NE) levels in the olfactory bulb. The anatomical correlates of the biochemical sequelae of deafferentation of olfactory bulb DA neurons were studied using immunohistochemical techniques to localize TH. Within 3 to 4 weeks all lesions produced a dramatic and uniform reduction in TH staining of the juxtaglomerular DA neurons and their processes which was paralleled by a reduction in DA and DOPAC levels and bulb weight. Seven weeks following reversible chemical lesions produced by Triton X-100, DA and DOPAC levels and tissue weight as well as TH staining in the juxtaglomerular neurons returned to control levels. These observations suggested that DA neurons remained present even when not demonstrable with TH antibodies. Additional evidence for the continued presence of the DA neurons was the ability of the olfactory bulbs from both lesioned mouse and rat to synthesize DA from exogenously administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). These data suggested that the decrease in DA levels and TH staining in the olfactory bulb following lesions of the olfactory receptor neurons were produced by transneuronal mechanisms since there was no direct injury of the bulb.

Both CGS 7525A and mianserin displaced 3H-spiroperidol binding from frontal cortex 5-HT2 binding sites. Although yohimbine resembled CGS 7525A in most respects, its activity at 5-HT2 binding sites was relatively low, CGS 7525A was not associated with any appreciable blockade of norepinephrine or serotonin uptake in vitro. Thus, CGS 7525A appears to be a promising new pharmacological tool for investigating the behavioral function of brain alpha 2 adrenoceptors.",,Netherlands,1983,10.1016/0024-3205(83)90081-4,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6131367

This hypothesis has recently received support from a variety of clinical investigations. Drugs which increase noradrenergic function induce anxiety in human subjects. Increased turnover of norepinephrine has been shown to occur with naturally occurring anxiety conditions. The mechanism of action clonidine and tricyclic antidepressants as antianxiety agents may be due to their ability to reduce central noradrenergic function.

28f3a29a-1c67-4c74-b74c-1094de04c4b7,[A biochemical theory of schizophrenia].,Kornhuber HH and Kornhuber J and Kim JS and Kornhuber ME ,Der Nervenarzt,,"In addition to the dopamine hypothesis, a glutamate hypothesis has been recently discussed in the biochemical theories on the cause of schizophrenia. In schizophrenic patients less glutamic acid has been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Glutamate is probably the most important excitatory transmitter of the mammalian forebrain. The liberation of glutamic acid in the striatum is inhibited by dopamine, more specifically by the D2 receptor, which is also though to be responsible for the antipsychotic effects of neuroleptic drugs. It seems possible that schizophrenia may be primarily caused by underfunction of glutamatergic corticostriatal and corticomesolimbic neurons rather than by overfunction of the dopaminergic system. The negative cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia would fit in with this hypothesis. The classical and the new atypical neuroleptic drugs show differential effects on glutamate and GABA in the brain tissue of the striatum and in the cerebrospinal fluid. Whereas sulpiride diminishes glutamate in the striatum and enhances glutamate in the cerebrospinal fluid, tiapride does not affect either of them. Correspondingly, tiapride does not show any antipsychotic effects. Haloperidol, on the other hand, enhances the GABA level in the striatum in a dose-related manner. These findings may perhaps prompt experimental research to find antipsychotic drugs with fewer side effects.",,Germany,1984,,English Abstract and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6151120

Effects on 5-HT metabolism in the spinal cord.,Bourgoin S and Oliveras JL and Bruxelle J and Hamon M and Besson JM ,Brain research,,"The direct electrical stimulation (with biphasic pulses of 1 msec, 10 pulses/sec, 200 microA, for 30 min) of the nucleus raphe magnus in chloral hydrate anaesthesized rats produced a significant acceleration (+50%) of 5-HT synthesis in the spinal cord as revealed by the increased rate of 5-HTP accumulation occurring at this level after the blockade of central 5-HTP decarboxylase with benserazid. In contrast, no change was detected in 5-HT metabolism in the forebrain of stimulated rats. The acceleration of 5-HT synthesis was likely not due to an increased availability of tryptophan for the rate-limiting enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase, since the concentration of this amino acid was changed neither in the spinal cord, nor in the forebrain of stimulated rats. The measurement of tryptophan hydroxylase activity in soluble extracts from the spinal cord of control and stimulated rats revealed that the acceleration in 5-HT synthesis produced by the electrical stimulation of the nucleus raphe magnus was not associated with a persisting activation of this enzyme. Although one cannot completely exclude that a short-lasting activation of tryptophan hydroxylase, no longer detectable in soluble extracts, has occurred in the spinal cord of stimulated rats, the present findings rather suggest that the rate of 5-HT synthesis can be controlled by factors other than only the concentration of tryptophan and the intrinsic activity of tryptophan hydroxylase in serotoninergic neurons. The demonstration of an acceleration of 5-HT synthesis in bulbospinal serotoninergic neurons under stimulating conditions close to those producing analgesia in rats further supports the role of these neuronal systems in the physiological mechanisms of pain control.",,Netherlands,1980,10.1016/0006-8993(80)91219-6,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6155975

(+)-Butaclamol was a potent inhibitor of dopamine, N-methyldopamine and noradrenaline (Ki congruent to 30-60 nM), but was less effective on ergometrine (Ki congruent to 310 nM). Tranylcypromine-stimulated fluid secretion in the absence and presence of (+)-butaclamol and (+/-)-sulpiride suggested that tranylcypromine's action is mediated through two receptors. (+/-)-Sulpiride, though a rather weak antagonist of ergometrine (Ki congruent to 6150 nM), was ineffectual as a dopamine blocker, indicating distinct receptor sites on this epithelium for dopamine and ergometrine. Both (+)-butaclamol and sulpiride reversed the autoinhibition associated with supramaximal levels of dopamine. Sulpiride also abolished spiperone's potentiation of dopamine. Butaclamol, on the other hand, had no such effect on spiperone's potentiation of dopamine. Finally, although the CNS of ticks contains both dopamine and noradrenaline in quantity (congruent to 650 and congruent to 370 ng . g-1 res respectively), the salivary glands contain far more dopamine than noradrenaline (congruent to 85 and congruent to 6 ng . g-1 respectively).

Accumulation of binding sites was linear over a 3 day period and was blocked by intracerebroventricular 6-OHDA given 1 day prior to sacrifice. A single dose of reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) caused a long lasting (6-8 week) biphasic depletion of frontal cortex norepinephrine (NE) associated with increased frontal cortex binding of another beta-receptor ligand, [3H]dihydroalprenolol [( 3H]DHA), at 7-14 days, and again at 28 days post-reserpine. Unlike the changes in cortical beta-receptors, retrograde transport of [125I]ICP in presynaptic noradrenergic neurons was decreased or blocked completely at 7-14 days and at 6 weeks, and was increased to 470% and 240% of control at 21 days and 8 weeks after reserpine. Anterograde transport of [3H]DHA binding sites was measured by accumulation proximal to a 6-OHDA lesion in this pathway. This transport varied in a pattern similar to that seen for retrograde transport of [125I]ICP binding sites. These data and others suggest that presynaptic beta-receptors are regulated independently of frontal cortex beta-receptors, which appear to be located primarily on postsynaptic cells.

Since we observed a dose-related inhibition of quipazine induced stereotypy (QISB) by a centrally acting DA antagonist (haloperidol) that could not be mimicked by a central 5-HT receptor blocking agent (methysergide), it appeared likely that QISB is mediated by striatal DA mechanisms. This was further supported by our observing that QISB could be potentiated by a subthreshold dose of the central DA agonist apomorphine. In light of this, and the presence of abnormal movements seen concomitantly with QISB that are typically produced by intrastriatal injections of 5-HT agonists, it appears that QISB is a complex phenomenon. While QISB seems to be primarily due to the stimulation of DA mechanisms, the effect of quipazine on behavior appears to be a combined result of its effects on both DA and 5-HT mechanisms. Specifically, central striatal DA receptors appear to mediate QISB per se, while serotonergic mechanisms stimulated by quipazine inhibit its further development and produce extrapyramidal-like abnormal movements.",,England,1983,10.3109/00207458308987364,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6222999

Evidence against the involvement of presynaptic serotonergic mechanism.,Fornal C and Radulovacki M ,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,,"The present study investigated the involvement of presynaptic serotonergic mechanisms in the sleep suppressant action of fenfluramine, an indirect serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist. Rats implanted with cerebrocortical and dorsal neck muscle electrodes were pretreated with either fluoxetine, an inhibitor of 5-HT uptake, or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis. Animals were continuously monitored by the EEG for 12 hr after an i.p. injection of 5 mg/kg of dl-fenfluramine hydrochloride. Pretreatment with fluoxetine failed to antagonize the fenfluramine-induced suppression of slow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep. However, chemical analyses showed that fluoxetine pretreatment completely prevented the depletion of brain 5-HT produced by fenfluramine, suggesting that fenfluramine did not gain entry into serotonergic neurons. Depletion of brain 5-HT by PCPA also failed to antagonize the sleep suppression caused by fenfluramine as well as that observed after administration of quipazine, a direct 5-HT receptor stimulant. Because administration of fenfluramine to PCPA-pretreated rats produced no additional depletion of 5-HT, it appears that 5-HT was no longer available for release by fenfluramine in these animals. Furthermore, neither pretreatment with fluoxetine nor PCPA antagonized the head-shaking induced by fenfluramine, a behavior associated with activation of central 5-HT receptors. These data indicate that the suppression of sleep produced by fenfluramine is not mediated through release of 5-HT as brain 5-HT concentrations were not related to the behavioral effects of the drug. The sleep suppressant action of fenfluramine may therefore result from a direct action of the drug on postsynaptic 5-HT receptors.",,United States,1983,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6223135

The 5-HT1 type is characterized by a higher affinity for agonists than for antagonists, whereas the 5-HT2 type binds preferentially to antagonists. However, neither of these receptor types apparently corresponds to the presynaptic autoreceptor controlling 5-HT release. In an attempt to identify the presynaptic autoreceptor directly, we synthesized the tritiated derivative of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (PAT), a new tetralin derivative with potent 5-HT agonist properties and carried out binding studies with rat brain membranes. As we report here, in the hippocampus, the properties of 3H-PAT binding sites correspond closely to those of 5-HT1 sites. In contrast, in the striatum, 3H-PAT binding sites exhibit a subcellular distribution and pharmacological characteristics usually associated with presynaptic autoreceptors. Furthermore, a marked loss of 3H-PAT binding sites occurs in the striatum (but not in the hippocampus) after the selective degeneration of serotoninergic fibres in 5,7-hydroxytryptamine (5,7-HT)-treated rats. Conversely, the sprouting of additional 5-HT terminals in the brain stem of adult rats treated at birth with 5,7-HT is associated with an increased density of 3H-PAT binding sites in this region. 3H-PAT thus seems to be a useful ligand for studying the biochemical and pharmacological characteristics of presynaptic autoreceptors in selected regions of rat brain.",,England,1983,10.1038/305140a0,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6225026

Following chronic administration of clenbuterol (5 mg/kg daily for 14 days), a procedure resulting in down-regulation of central beta-adrenoceptors, a larger dose of clenbuterol was necessary to enhance the quipazine-induced hyperactivity, suggesting that the mechanism of enhancement involved central post-synaptic beta-adrenoceptors. Further evidence for this conclusion was that a lesion of central noradrenaline pathways produced by 6-hydroxydopamine did not abolish the clenbuterol-induced enhancement of the quipazine-mediated behaviour. The binding characteristics of 5-HT2-receptors were unchanged by acute or chronic administration of clenbuterol. Clenbuterol (5 mg/kg) increased the percentage of plasma free (non-albumin bound) tryptophan, plasma free fatty acid concentration and the concentration of tryptophan and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the brain. The increase in 5-HT turnover in brain was prevented by pretreatment with the beta 1-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol, which enters the brain poorly. It is therefore suggested that the clenbuterol-induced increase in 5-HT metabolism results from the increase in the concentration of plasma free fatty acid which increases plasma free tryptophan and thus increases the concentration of tryptophan in brain and 5-HT synthesis in brain. The clenbuterol-induced enhancement of 5-HT-mediated behaviour is therefore not associated with its effect on 5-HT metabolism. The data are discussed in relation to that obtained after administration of antidepressant drugs.",,England,1983,10.1016/0028-3908(83)90098-9,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6225031

Both hyperemotionality and antinociception exhibited parallel decline in septal-lesioned rats with daily handling and in VMH-lesioned rats following treatment with diazepam. Autoanalgesia elicited by conditioned fear was blocked by spinal cord transection but not by diazepam. Although opiate binding experiments suggested the involvement of endorphins as mediators of autoanalgesia, hypophysectomy, morphine tolerance or very high doses of opiate antagonists failed to reduce the antinociception. Electrolytic lesions of the nucleus raphe magnus, a descending serotonergic system, did cause a significant reduction in autoanalgesia.

In the present study, we examine detailed properties of 5-HT2 receptor regulation by chronic treatment with amitriptyline. Chronic but not acute treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline reduces binding to 5-HT2 receptors by [3H]spiroperidol and beta adrenergic receptor binding of [3H]dihydroalprenolol in brain membranes. The decrease is time-dependent, gradually reversible and represents a change in the number of binding sites with no alteration in drug affinities for 5-HT2 receptors. The effect can be observed at daily doses of 2.5 mg/kg, similar to clinically effective doses in humans. At all doses and time intervals, the decrease in 5-HT2 receptors is more marked than the concurrent change in total beta adrenergic receptor binding.

We have investigated its effects on norepinephrine release from adrenergic nerves by using the dog saphenous vein as a model of the sympathetic neuroeffector junction. Isolated strips of vein were mounted for isometric tension recording or incubated with [3H]norepinephrine and mounted for superfusion, tension recording and the superfusate. Amitriptyline (10(-6); 5 x 10(-6) M) increased the overflow of [3H]norepinephrine but decreased that of [3,4-3H]dihydroxyphenylglycol from electrically stimulated strips. The selective decreased in the overflow of this metabolite indicates that amitriptyline inhibits neuronal uptake. However, the increased overflow of [3H]norepinephrine caused by amitriptyline also occurred when neuronal uptake was blocked by cocaine (3 x 10(-5) M) but was abolished when prejunctional alpha receptors were blockade by phentolamine (10(-5) M). Amitriptyline attenuated the prejunctional inhibitory action of exogenous norepinephrine, this indicates that the drug interacts with prejunctional alpha receptors. Amitriptyline also antagonized the prejunctional inhibitory action of acetylcholine, both in the absence and presence of cocaine and phentolamine. These effects were not due to a nonspecific action of the drug as it did not reduce the prejunctional inhibitory effect of histamine. Thus, amitriptyline can increase the concentration of norepinephrine at the neuroeffector junction by blockade of neuronal uptake and by interacting with prejunctional alpha and muscarinic receptors. Since the cardiac adrenergic nerves also possess these receptors, the results could help to explain the cardiotoxic effects of the drug.",,United States,1980,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6259320

Isolated papillary muscles from guinea-pig hearts were paced at a constant frequency and isometric contractions reported. 2. Guinea-pigs were either untreated or pretreated with reserpine. Three pretreatment schedules were used; a) 0.5 mg kg-1 i.p. at 24 h, b) 5.0 mg kg-1 at 72 h and 3.0 mg kg-1 at 48 and 24 h, or c) 0.1 mg kg-1 daily for 7 days. 3. Cumulative concentration-response curves for the isoprenaline-induced increases in tension were obtained. The geometric mean EC50 values after the 3 and 7 day reserpine pretreatment schedules were significantly (P less than 0.05) less than for untreated guinea-pigs indicating a supersensitivity. 4. EC50 values for the positive inotropic responses to histamine and calcium in papillary muscles from reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs did not differ significantly (P less than 0.05) from those from untreated animals. This suggests that the supersensitivity to isoprenaline is beta-adrenoceptor specific. 5. Membrane fractions were prepared from the ventricles of the untreated and reserpine-pretreated guinea-pigs from which papillary muscles had been removed. Binding of [3H]-dihydroalprenolol ([3H]-DHA) to beta-adrenoceptors of these membranes was determined. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) and total numbers of binding sites (Bmax) were determined by Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves for [3H]-DHA binding. 6. There was no increase in affinity (fall in KD value) or change in the total number of binding sites associated with reserpine-induced supersensitivity. The equilibrium inhibition constant (Ki) for the displacement of [3H]-DHA binding by isoprenaline was also identical in membranes from untreated and reserpine-pretreated animals. Thus reserpine-induced supersensitivity to isoprenaline does not appear to involve a change in affinity for the beta-adrenoceptor or in receptor numbers as determined by [3H]-DHA binding.",,Germany,1982,10.1007/BF00510135,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6290902

Early work showed increases in rat brain levels of 5-HT which were later localized to the nerve-ending fraction. With improved methodology, the 5-HT increment was further detected in the synaptic vesicle fraction. These effects were obtained with several indoleamine hallucinogens but not with mescaline. LSD has been most thoroughly studied and has served as the prototypical compound in ascertaining the mode of action of these drugs. Pretreatment with reserpine abolished the 5-HT effects of LSD in the vesicular fraction. However, a new compartment, termed ""juxtavesicular,"" displayed 5-HT increases following reserpine and LSD. A soluble binding site for 5-HT within the synaptoplasm has been postulated in confirmation of independent results by other groups of investigators. The origin of the 5-HT increment appears to be associated with newly synthesized amine. This was deduced from experiments involving various 5-HT synthesis blockers. To ascertain whether inhibition of raphÃ© neuronal firing is responsible for the accumulation of 5-HT at the nerve terminal, two sets of experiments were performed. Destruction of the raphÃ© cell bodies by radiofrequency lesions failed to abolish the LSD-induced 5-HT increase early after the lesion. Destruction of cortical 5-HT neurons with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine completely abolished the 5-HT effect of LSD.

This effect was also stereospecifically antagonized by sulpiride. Apomorphine was also more potent (KDapp 100 nM) than dopamine, whereas norepinephrine and SKF 38393, a specific D1 agonist, were poorly active; isoproterenol and clonidine were inactive. Ergots derivatives such as CB 154, LY 14865, pergolide, and lergotrile were potent agonists. alpha-Dihydroergocryptine was a partial agonist of the dopamine receptor negatively coupled with an adenylate cyclase.

387ee386-a07b-4a65-9a7b-edc11f076da7,Chronic antidepressant therapy and associated changes in central monoaminergic receptor functioning.,Sugrue MF ,Pharmacology & therapeutics,,"Acutely administered antidepressants possess a multiplicity of pharmacological actions. However, the fact that agents possessing similar pharmacological actions are devoid of antidepressant activity, together with the lack of correlation between doses required for acute pharmacological effects and clinical efficacy, suggest that the mechanism(s) of action of antidepressants cannot be directly attributed to the acute pharmacological properties of the drugs. The lag phase in onset of clinical effectiveness emphasizes the importance of adaptive changes following chronic antidepressant administration. A rapidly accelerating trend in attempting to delineate the precise molecular mechanisms of action of antidepressants is the shift in emphasis following chronic antidepressant therapies from alterations in uptake, storage, synthesis and release of neurotransmitters to adaptive changes in receptor functioning. These adaptations occur both pre- and postsynaptically. Examples of the former are alpha 2 and DA presynaptic receptors, both being down-regulated by certain forms of chronic antidepressant therapy. The fact that the NE-coupled adenylate cyclase system in rat brain slices is down-regulated by tricyclics, atypical antidepressants, MAO inhibitors and ECT emphasizes the importance of the system. Electrophysiological and behavioral studies point to the up-regulation of central alpha 1 and 5-HT receptor functioning following long-term antidepressant therapy. In contrast to the beta-adrenoceptor, these findings cannot be correlated with data from radioligand binding studies. In general central alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding remains unaltered. This is also true for 5-HT1 binding whereas cortical 5-HT2 binding is both increased and decreased depending on the type of antidepressant therapy being investigated. The relationship of these adaptive changes to the clinical efficacy of antidepressants in man is not clear since there is generally a lack of good models for studying human central receptor functioning. A review of current data from animal studies would tend to disfavour the view that all forms of antidepressant therapy possess a common mechanism of action. Perhaps multiple intervention sites exist. The introduction and evaluation of agents possessing a specificity of pharmacological action will undoubtedly aid psychotherapeutic research. The knowledge that peptides and 'classical' neurotransmitters can co-exist in the same neurone will undoubtedly generate studies of the significance and importance of the co-transmitter function of peptides in the mechanisms of action of antidepressant therapies.",,England,1983,10.1016/0163-7258(83)90065-7,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6312466

To achieve this purpose we studied (a) the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by secretagogues known to trigger the secretory response through activation of receptor-associated channels (acetylcholine, nicotine), voltage-sensitive Na+ (veratridine) and Ca2+ (high [K+] ) channels or direct, channel-independent promotion of Ca2+ entry (ionomycin); and (b) the selective blockade of some of those responses using ionic manipulations (Na+ deprivation, high Mg2+) or drugs known to block the activity of receptor-operated channels (imipramine, cocaine), voltage-dependent Na+ (tetrodotoxin) or Ca2+ (nitrendipine) channels. Inhibition by nitrendipine, a potent Ca2+ antagonist, of the secretory responses to both nicotine and high [K+] indicates a preferential Ca2+ entry through voltage-sensitive channels during the secretory process. Blockade by cocaine and imipramine of the release of [3H]noradrenaline evoked by acetylcholine and nicotine, without alteration of the responses to high [K+], veratridine or ionomycin, speaks in favor of a selective inactivation of the nicotinic receptor-associated channel. Since Na+ deprivation abolished [3H]noradrenaline release produced by nicotine, it seems that Na+ entry through the receptor-linked ionophore might be a primary event in the initiation of the secretory process; the fact that tetrodotoxin did not affect the release favors this view. However, veratridine induced a tetrodotoxin-sensitive secretory response, suggesting the presence of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels which might physiologically be used to propagate action potentials through gap junctions between adjacent chromaffin cells, only in the intact gland.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,United States,1983,10.1016/0306-4522(83)90126-4,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6320053

In the hippocampus of rats with a lesion of serotonergic nerve terminals produced by neonatal administration of 5,7-DHT, the depletion of serotonin was paralleled by a decrease in (3H)imipramine recognition sites. (3H)Imipramine recognition sites in brain tissue or platelets are associated with serotonin uptake sites. A significant correlation exists between the potency of a series of antidepressants and other compounds to displace high affinity (3H)imipramine binding and to inhibit the neuronal uptake of serotonin but not of norepinephrine. There is a significant correlation between the ability of drugs to displace (3H)desipramine binding and to inhibit norepinephrine but not serotonin reuptake. (3H)Desipramine recognition sites are located, at least in part, at noradrenergic nerve terminals since destruction of these terminals by 6-OH-DA results in parallel decrease in (3H)desipramine, but not in (3H)imipramine binding. The high affinity recognition sites of (3H)imipramine and (3H)desipramine in the brain could be physiologically and pharmacologically relevant regulatory sites associated with neuronal uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, respectively. Treatments which clinically lead to improvement of depression (eg. antidepressants, ECT, REM sleep deprivation) were shown to ""down-regulate"" (3H)imipramine binding sites in brain of experimental animals. The density of (3H)imipramine binding sites was shown to be lower in platelets from depressive patients and in brains of suicide victims.

Rapid mixing of AcCho and [3H]CPZ with the receptor followed by brief (less than 20 msec) UV irradiation results in the selective labeling of the four chains of the AcCho receptor, according to a rapid bimolecular association process close to diffusion-controlled. Rapid association is not observed with the competitive antagonists d-tubocurarine or flaxedil or the snake venom alpha-toxins. Its initial rate increases with agonist concentration, with maxima of 0.6 for carbamoylcholine and 0.2 for phenyltrimethylammonium taking 1 for AcCho, with apparent dissociation constants of 30 microM, 400 microM, and 300 microM for AcCho, carbamoylcholine, and phenyltrimethylammonium, respectively, and with sigmoid shape (Hill coefficients of 1.1-1.3). Under conditions in which the receptor ""desensitizes"" and the ionic channel closes (preincubation with AcCho), rapid [3H]CPZ association decreases in parallel.

However, in all instances, alpha-methyl substitution resulted in a higher selectivity for alpha-2 adrenoceptors (over alpha-1 adrenoceptors). Thus, while epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine all produced vasoconstriction that was mediated equally by postsynaptic vascular alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoceptors, their corresponding alpha-methyl-substituted derivatives produced vasoconstriction exclusively by activation of postsynaptic vascular alpha-2 adrenoceptors. The beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated chronotropic effects of these phenethylamines were inconsistently affected by alpha-methyl substitution, with an increase in potency being observed for alpha-methyl substitution of norepinephrine and decreases in potency being observed for alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine and dopamine. In marked contrast, alpha-methyl substitution of epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine was associated with consistent and dramatic increases in potency for beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated vasodepressor activity. These results indicate that alpha-2 and beta-2 adrenoceptors possess the unique ability to recognize and/or accept alpha-methyl substituents on phenethylamines and that this ability is not shared by their respective receptor subtypes, the alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenoceptors. Furthermore, the results show that alpha-methylepinephrine is a potent beta adrenoceptor agonist, with an apparent 500-fold selectivity for beta-2 adrenoceptors over beta-1 adrenoceptors.",,United States,1984,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6381693

The properties of catecholamine release from these isolated cells have been determined and compared with the intact perfused gland. Exposure to carbamylcholine, veratridine or high K evokes a transient increase in the rate of catecholamine release in association with dopamine beta hydroxylase but not lactate dehydrogenase. Exposure to A23187 releases catecholamine together with lactate dehydrogenase. In all cases release requires extracellular Ca. A comparison is made of the sensitivities of catecholamine release evoked by various agonists and the effects of nicotinic antagonists, D 600, Na-free media, TTX, Mg and trifluoperazine. Resting and carbamylcholine-evoked catecholamine release is relatively insensitive to the nature of the major extracellular anion and to the external pH over the range 6.4 to 7.8. Measurements with the dye 3 3'-Diethylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (di S-C2-(5)) show that release evoked by carbamylcholine or low concentrations of veratridine is associated--on average--with a small steady depolarization of the cells. Catecholamine release in response to nicotinic agonists, but not the other secretagogues, is greater at 20 degrees C than at 37 degrees C, possibly because of a slower rate of receptor desensitization at this temperature.

Among the various strains of rats studied i.e. Sprague-Dawley, Long Evans and Wistar, the latters were selected as the most responsive to the dopamine agonist apomorphine. However, even in the Wistar strain, only about 60% of animals responded to a test-dose of 0.4 mg/kg apomorphine by adopting in a sustained manner the typical upright position against the walls of a suitable experimental cage. Hence responsive rats were preselected 4 days before the experimental sessions and finally rated during a 60-min observation period. Increasing the test-dose of apomorphine led to a biphasic effect, the spontaneous climbing behavior being decreased at low dosage and, then, both the percentage of climbing animals and the duration of the behavior were progressively increased at higher dosages. A scoring system based on an all-or-none evaluation of the frequency of stereotyped climbing episodes over the 1 h observation period was finally adopted allowing to establish dose response curves to apomorphine and its more potent derivative N-propylnorapomorphine. Dexamphetamine (associated to L-Dopa) also produced the stereotyped climbing behavior. The latter was completely abolished in animals treated with the ""atypical"" antipsychotic sulpiride.

Supplementum,,"Deprenyl inhibits MAO-B selectively in different animal species and in man. Its safety margin is remarkable. We were able to block MAO-B activity in the brain selectively in vivo in four species (mouse, rat, cat, dog) with s.c. administration of 0.17-0.31% of LD50. The usual oral dose range in clinical practice, 5-20 mg daily (0.05-0.2 mg/kg), is about ten times lower than the orally active dose in the rat. Deprenyl proved to be safe drug in man. Neither hypertensive reactions nor the need for any special dietary care were ever encountered during long-term (2-8 years) daily administration of the drug. The most important effect of deprenyl in the brain is the sensitization of dopaminergic neurons to physiological and pharmacological influences, but in contrast to levodopa or bromocrytine, deprenyl does not elicit an acute increase in dopaminergic activity. The effect of deprenyl is due, on the one hand, to the inhibition of MAO-B and, on the other hand, to inhibition of the uptake of dopamine. In agreement with its peculiar spectrum of pharmacological activity, deprenyl proved to be a useful adjuvant to levodopa alone or in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor. In addition, a supplement of deprenyl in Parkinson's disease led to significant prolongation of the duration of the illness. This has not been observed so far with other antiparkinsonian drugs. The dopamine content of the human caudate nucleus decreases by 13% per decade over the age of 45. The hypothesis has been put forward that the significant increase of incidence of depression in the elderly, the age-dependent decline in male sexual vigour and the frequent appearance of parkinsonian symptoms in the later decades of life might be attributed to a decrease of dopamine and 'trace amines' in the brain.

Pretreatment with carbidopa suppressed the salivary secretion produced by L-dopa in haloperidol-treated and control rats whose glands had been denervated.

The affinities of antagonists for binding to the soluble receptors are virtually identical with those observed with the membrane-bound receptors. The affinities of agonists however, correspond to those for the form of the receptors in the membranes having low affinity for those agonists (De Lean, A., Kilpatrick, B. F., and Caron, M. G. (1982) Mol. Pharmacol. 22, 290-297). Thus, after solubilization, agonist high affinity interactions with the receptor and their sensitivity to modulation by guanine nucleotides are lost. However, high affinity agonist binding and its sensitivity to guanine nucleotides can be preserved if the membrane-bound receptors are prelabeled with the agonist [3H]n-propylapomorphine prior to solubilization. In order to investigate the molecular basis for these changes in the properties of agonist binding, the solubilized receptors were characterized by chromatographic procedures. Using molecular exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography, [3H]n-propylapomorphine-prelabeled receptors elute as an apparent larger molecular species than either unlabeled or antagonist [( 3H]spiroperidol)-pre-labeled receptors. Moreover, incubation of the pooled agonist-prelabeled receptor peak with guanine nucleotides effects a decrease in the apparent size of the receptors such that upon rechromatography they elute in a position coincidental with the 3H-antagonist-pre-labeled receptor peak. Thus, occupancy of the receptors by agonists promotes the formation of a guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist high affinity form of the receptor which is of larger apparent size presumably due to the association of the receptor with a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.",,United States,1983,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6643440

Relation to postsynaptic serotonergic stimulation.,Fornal C and Radulovacki M ,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,,"The effects of fenfluramine, an indirect serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist, on sleep and brain indole- and catecholamines were examined in rats. Animals implanted with cerebrocortical and dorsal neck muscle electrodes were continuously monitored by the EEG for 12 hr after i.p. injections of dl-fenfluramine hydrochloride (1, 5 and 10 mg/kg). Fenfluramine produced a dose-dependent suppression of both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS). Accompanying these effects was a dose-dependent increase in head-shaking, a behavior associated with activation of central 5-HT receptors. The incidence of head-shaking was inversely related to SWS and REMS time. At doses which significantly suppressed sleep (5 and 10 mg/kg), fenfluramine lowered whole brain 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations without affecting brain catecholamines. Pretreatment with metergoline (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.), a 5-HT receptor antagonist, 1 hr before the administration of fenfluramine (5 mg/kg) blocked the fenfluramine-induced suppression of SWS in a dose-dependent manner and prevented head-shaking behavior, but failed to prevent the suppression of REMS. In contrast, pretreatment with alpha-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.), a dopamine receptor antagonist, had no effect on the suppression of sleep and the stimulation of head-shaking behavior produced by fenfluramine. These data suggest that the suppression of SWS but not of REMS by fenfluramine is mediated by activation of the serotonergic system. The increase in serotonergic activity produced by fenfluramine may result from the drug-induced release of 5-HT with subsequent stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that pharmacological stimulation of 5-HT receptors suppresses sleep in the rat.",,United States,1983,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6683311

Dopamine receptors were quantified in membrane preparations of anterior pituitary tissue using [3H] spiperone as the ligand. On the basis of saturation isotherms, it was calculated that the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and binding capacity for [3H]spiperone binding to pituitary membranes from young rats were 34.2 pM and 82 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The relative binding capacity of membranes from aged rats was 35% greater than that of membranes from young rats. There was no difference in the Kd values in aged and young rats. When the relative binding of [3H]spiperone by anterior pituitary membranes from individual animals was quantified by incubation with a saturating concentration of the ligand, it was found that [3H]spiperone binding in aged rats was significantly greater than that in young rats. When the subcellular localization of dopamine in anterior pituitary tissue was examined by means of density gradient centrifugation, it was found that the subcellular distribution of dopamine in tissue of aged rats was quantitatively different from that in young rats. In young rats, a small amount of dopamine was associated with light particles, whereas a large amount of dopamine was associated with heavy particles, which cosedimented with PRL-containing granules. In aged rats, the amount of dopamine associated with light particles was 5 times that found in young rats, whereas the amount of dopamine associated with heavy particles was the same as that in young rats. We speculate that altered intracellular compartmentalization of dopamine, leading to a marked accumulation of dopamine in the light particles, is related to increased secretion of PRL in aged rats.",,United States,1984,10.1210/endo-114-3-974,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6697971

The cardiovascular effects of DPDA were of brief duration, whereas hypotension and bradycardia induced by LY171555 were sustained. Pretreatment of monkeys with sulpiride (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) abolished the blood pressure and cardiac rate-lowering effects of DPDA and LY171555. During the time course of cardiovascular alterations produced by LY171555 (100 micrograms/kg i.v.), increments in cardiac rate due to electrical stimulation of the right stellate ganglion were inhibited. This effect also was abolished by sulpiride treatment. The antagonism of neural tachycardia by LY171555 was selective, as the drug had no concomitant inhibitory action on cardiac rate or diastolic blood pressure responses to exogenous norepinephrine. Hemodynamic analysis demonstrated that DPDA (20-200 micrograms/kg i.v.) and LY171555 (1-10 micrograms/kg i.v.) each lowered arterial blood pressure, without reflex tachycardia, by dilating the systemic vasculature; cardiac output and stroke volume were maintained. Furthermore, left ventricular minute work and stroke work were reduced by each drug in association with systemic hypotension. The data suggest that DPDA and LY171555 produce cardiovascular responses by inhibiting neurogenic release of norepinephrine through an interaction with D-2 dopamine receptors.

The influence of some drugs which affect the dopaminergic system was studied on chemosensory responses to dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (ACh), sodium cyanide NaCN) and hypoxia during experiments on pentobarbitone anaesthetized cats in which chemoreceptor activity was recorded from the peripheral end of a sectioned sinus nerve. 2. Spontaneous chemosensory activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by DA (0.5-5 microgram, I.A.). Higher doses (10-50 microgram) caused a delayed increase in discharge and were associated with inconsistent inhibitory responses. 3. The DA antagonist alpha-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg, I.A.) blocked the inhibitory response to DA without affecting either the spontaneous discharge frequency or the response to ACh. The effect of NaCN was potentiated, and during hypoxia chemoreceptor activity increased more rapidly, although the maximum frequency attained was not appreciably different from control values. Similar results were obtained with haloperidol (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, I.V.). 4. Higher doses of alpha-flupenthixol (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, I.A.) increased spontaneous chemoreceptor activity, but this was regarded as a non-specific effect of the drug since at these doses the inhibitory effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was also abolished. 5. The animals were exposed to alternate periods of hypoxia and hyperoxia following administration of the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl p-tyrosine (AMPT, 0.2-10 mg/kg, I.A.). The inhibitory response previously evoked by amphetamine was abolished, and electron microscopic studies showed a great reduction in the number of dense-cored granules, both of which suggested that DA levels in the carotid body had been substantially reduced. Responses to NaCN and hypoxia were slightly potentiated following AMPT, but neither spontaneous activity nor the response to ACh was affected. 6. Apomorphine (0.05-0.2 mg/kg, I.A.) inhibited the chemoreceptor discharge for up to 45 min, an effect which was antagonized by alpha-flupenthixol (0.2 mg/kg, I.A.), implying it resulted from DA receptor stimulation. Although responses to NaCN, hypoxia and higher doses of ACh were reduced following administration of apomorphine, the reduction was not very marked. 7. These results are not compatible with the theory of Osborne & Butler (1975), that in normoxia DA is tonically released in the carotid body and suppresses spontaneous chemosensory activity. 8. It is concluded that DA modulates chemosensory activity by influencing the rate of increase in discharge, without affecting maximum discharge frequency. The mechanism whereby DA is released in response to increased chemosensory activity remains to be established.",,England,1978,10.1113/jphysiol.1978.sp012354,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-671358

Preincubation of slices with haloperidol (10(-6) M) greatly reduced, while (-)sulpiride (10(-6) M) failed to alter the increase of phosphorylation elicited by dopamine. Prolonged incubation of striatal slices with LY 141865 (10(-5) M) or isoproterenol (10(-5) M) increased the phosphate-incorporation only in one of the protein bands with an apparent molecular weight of 42,000. Incubation of striatal slices with cholera toxin increased the phosphorylation of protein bands in a similar way to those elicited by dopamine.

Treatment with chlorpheniramine prevented the inhibitory effect of aspirin or tranylcypromine. Combined treatment with chlorpheniramine plus aspirin or tranylcypromine slowed the development of histamine-induced relaxations as did the treatment with chlorpheniramine alone. Relaxations of mesenteric and gastroepiploic arteries induced by histamine were markedly attenuated or abolished by combined treatment with chlorpheniramine and cimetidine. Histamine-induced relaxations of coronary and renal arterial strips were suppressed by cimetidine alone but were unaffected by aspirin. Contractile responses of cerebral arterial strips to histamine were attenuated by chlorpheniramine and potentiated by aspirin. The collagen-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by treatment with bathing media in which mesenteric arteries were stimulated by histamine; the inhibition was prevented by treatment of the arteries with aspirin. It may be concluded that relaxation of mesenteric and gastroepiploic arteries induced by histamine is mainly associated with the release of prostaglandin I2 from the arterial wall, which results from an activation of histaminergic H1 receptors.

In further studies with calf and rat retina, stereospecific binding sites were also found for the dopamine agonist [3H]ADTN (2-amino-6,7,-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapththalene). The [3H]spiroperidol binding sites in calf retina were pharmacologically similar to the dopaminergic spiroperidol binding sites previously demonstrated to be present in striatum. However, calf and rabbit retina contained less than 1/10 the concentration of [3H]spiroperidol binding sites found in striatum. Saturation studies and Scatchard analyses showed a single class [3H]spiroperidol binding sites with Kd (apparent dissociation constant) = 0.3 and 0.2 nM and Bmax (binding site number) = 38 and 24 fmol/mg protein in calf retina and rabbit retina respectively. Rates of [3H]spiroperidol association and dissociation were also evaluated in calf retina. Drug specificity for [3H]ADTN binding in calf retina resembled that previously reported for striatal [3H]ADTN binding and thus differed from retinal [3H]spiroperidol binding. Calf retinal [3H]ADTN binding sites had a Kd = 9 nM and Bmax = 113 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein. Thus, the total number of [3H]ADTN sites in retina was at least twice that of [3H]spiroperidol sites. Guanine nucleotides (GTP and Gpp (NH)p) but not ATP reduced the affinity of the dopamine agonist ADTN for [3H]spiroperidol binding, and also reduced the specific binding of [3H]ADTN itself up to a maximal value of about 50% of control binding. Saturation studies of calf retinal [3H]ADTN binding confirmed that Gpp(NH)p-displaceable sites were a discrete saturable subset of stereospecific [3H]ADTN sites with Kd = 9 nM and Bmax = 50 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein. The Gpp(NH)p insensitive sites had a Kd = 9 nM and Bmax = 63 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein. It is proposed that although [3H]ADTN sites differ pharmacologically from [3H]spiroperidol sites, since [3H]spiroperidol sites are guanine nucleotide-sensitive and similar in number to the guanine nucleotide-sensitive class of [3H]ADTN sites, they may possibly be related to these sites as well as to adenylate cyclase.

However, the specificity of PEA for the type B enzyme was found to be concentration-dependent. When low concentrations of PEA and 5-HT were used to measure type B and type A activities, respectively, both clorgyline and deprenyl were highly selective for the sensitive form of MAO in vivo. However, as the concentration of PEA was increased, the type B inhibitor deprenyl became less effective in preventing deamination of PEA. Conversely, the type A inhibitor clorgyline became more effective in this regard. Kinetic analysis following selective in vivo inhibition showed PEA deamination by both forms of MAO with a 13-fold greater affinity for the type B enzyme. In vivo dose-response curves obtained with the common substrates DA and p-TA showed approximately 20% deamination by the B enzyme. Kinetic values for DA and p-TA deamination in in vivo-treated tissue possessing only type A or type B MAO activity, revealed a 2.5-fold greater affinity for the type A enzyme. These studies show the importance of concentration on substrate specificity in striatal tissue. The results obtained characterize the common substrate properties of DA and p-TA as well as of PEA in rat striatum.

Behaviorally, chronic haloperidol significantly enhanced apomorphine-induced chewing and sniffing stereotypies, associated with DA nigrostriatal activation, while clozapine selectively enhanced apomorphine locomotor activity and cage-floor crossing, behavior associated with DA mesolimbic activation. Biochemically, chronic haloperidol significantly enhanced 3H-spiroperidol binding in striatum and in mesolimbic loci (nucleus accumbens/olfactory tubercle) while chronic clozapine failed to produce such enhancement. Acute haloperidol induced an initial decrease in striatal ACH concentration followed by a return of ACH to normal levels within 1 week. There was no change in choline acetylase activity during the same time interval. These findings suggest that haloperidol may inhibit DA mechanisms in both the nigrostriatal may inhibit DA mechanisms in both the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems, but that the effect of clozapine on DA mechanisms may be specific to mesolimbic rather than striatal structures. At the same time, the lack of effect of clozapine on 3H-spiroperidol binding may indicate that behaviorally important changes in DA sensitivity can develop independent of changes in post-synaptic DA receptors.

Rats were injected (i.p.) with D-amphetamine sulphate (0.5, 1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) and 10 min later confined for 30 min to one side of a shuttle box in which each of the two compartments had distinctive features. On alternate (control) days they received saline injections and were confined for 30 min to the opposite side. At all doses D-amphetamine produced place preference for the distinctive compartment that previously had been associated with the drug. Pretreatment with haloperidol (0.15 or 1.0 mg/kg) antagonized the place preference produced by amphetamine (1.5 mg/kg). By itself, haloperidol (0.15 or 1.0 mg/kg) did not produce place aversion. In separate experiments the D-amphetamine-induced place preference was examined in rats that had received 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the nucleus accumbens. Animals with the greatest depletion of dopamine did not show preference for the compartment associated with D-amphetamine. Furthermore, the time spent on the amphetamine-reinforced side correlated significantly with the levels of dopamine remaining in the nucleus accumbens but not with the dopamine content in the striatum. Depletion of peripheral catecholamines by systemic injections of 6-OHDA did not affect D-amphetamine-induced place preference conditioning. Other groups of animals that received the dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, also developed a conditioned preference for the compartment that had been associated with the drug treatment.

The incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate into anterior pituitary gland PI as well as serum PRL levels were significantly (P less than 0.01) greater in female than in male rats. No significant sex-related difference was found in the incorporation by pituitary tissue of 32P into phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Dopamine decreased the incorporation of 32P into PI, but not into PC or PE, by female rat pituitary glands; this effect was reversed by two dopamine receptor-blocking agents, haloperidol and pimozide. After dopamine was removed from the incubation medium, basal 32P incorporation into PI was restored within 10 min. The administration of bromocriptine (500 micrograms/kg, ip, 4 h earlier) significantly reduced pituitary PI turnover. Conversely, in vivo injection of alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MpT; 200 mg, ip, 2.5 h before death), an inhibitor of catecholamine biosynthesis, dramatically increased serum PRL levels. In vitro incorporation of 32P into PI, but not into PC or PE, increased (+130%) when these glands were incubated for 30 min with radiolabeled phosphate. The in vitro addition of 0.5 microM dopamine to glands from alpha MpT-treated rats counteracted the stimulation of 32P incorporation into PI produced by alph MpT treatment. In rats bearing the transplantable PRL-secreting tumor MtTW15, the hyperprolactinemia produced by the tumor stimulates hypothalamic turnover of dopamine, with a consequent inhibition of pituitary gland PRL secretion. 32P incorporation into PI, but not into PC or PE, was significantly (P less than 0.01) inhibited (-41%) in pituitary glands from these rats. The injection of alpha MpT (200 mg/kg, ip) or haloperidol (2 mg/kg, ip) 12 and 3 h before death into MtTW15 tumor-bearing rats abolished the inhibition of 32P incorporation into pituitary PI. Dopamine also decreased PI turnover in the 7315a PRL-secreting pituitary tumor.

The substrate specificity, concentration, and subcellular and regional distributions of these sites suggest that they may represent a component of the serotonin transmitter system. Pharmacological analysis of [3H]THT binding, coupled with brain lesion and drug treatment experiments, revealed that, unlike other antidepressants, [3H] THT does not attach to either a biogenic amine transporter or serotonin binding sites. Rather, it would appear that [3H]THT may be an antagonist ligand for the serotonin binding site.

Supplementum,,"Activation of postsynaptic noradrenergic alpha 1-receptors may be involved in the mediation of psychomotor activating effects of tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) drugs. On the other hand, the pronounced sedative properties of some TCA drugs seem to be correlated with their alpha 1-receptor blocking capacity. The presynaptic alpha 2-receptors probably mediate the feed back inhibition of central NE neurons seen after administration of TCA drugs, particularly the secondary amines. Yet other antidepressants such as mianserin are potent antagonists at central alpha 2-receptors, a phenomenon which can even cause activation of brain NE neurons and form a basis for their therapeutic action. beta-Receptor activation in the brain is also suggested to participate in the therapeutic effect of several drugs, e.g. mianserin and the putative antidepressant agent salbutamol, a beta 2- receptor agonist. A reduced central beta-receptor activation may, accordingly, contribute to depressive symptoms associated with treatment with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, both by their action per se as well as by secondary effects on the monoamine systems, which we recently have demonstrated. Facilitation of brain 5-HT neurotransmission seems to be achieved with several TCA drugs not only via inhibition of reuptake but also through sensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, developing during repeated treatment. In contrast the ""presynaptic"" 5-HT receptors do not show increased sensitivity during chronic TCA drug treatment, thus allowing for an enhanced synaptic effect of 5-HT induced by TCA drugs.",,Denmark,1981,10.1111/j.1600-0447.1981.tb00710.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-6939326

Microinjections of apomorphine (APO), pimozide, or 0.9% saline were made bilaterally in 0.5 or 1.0 microliter vols. using a Harvard infusion pump. Oxygen consumption, and colonic (Tc), tail-skin, and ambient temperatures were monitored each minute. Microinjections of APO into the SN produced a dose dependent hypothermia that was antagonized by the central (1.0 microgram) or systemic (0.5mg/kg i.p.) injection of pimozide. This hypothermia was associated with increased heat loss and decreased heat production and occurred at ambient temperatures of 15, 23 and 25 degree C indicating that APO did not produce a poikilothermic state. Injecting 20 microgram APO into the PO/AH or SN produced similar hypothermic responses; Tc fell 0.87 /+- 0.10 degree C and 1.02 /+- 0.08 degree C, respectively. Pimozide injected into the SN failed to alter thermoregulation during exercise or exogenous heating. Moreover, systemic injections of APO before and after electrolytic lesioning of the SN produced similar hypothermic responses. However, when the SN was lesioned, (a) resting Tc was significantly reduced, and (b) during exposure to a 35 degree C environment for 55 min, Tc rose to 39.5 /+- 0.68 degree C before the lesion compared with a rise to only 38.5 /+- 0.13 degree C after the lesion.

Prazosin, 0.07 mg/kg/min i.v. for 7 minutes, induced sustained hypotensive effects for more than 12 hours. The peak effects occurred 30-45 minutes after administration. Prazosin increased heart rate by 28 +/- 9%, did not change mean coronary blood flow significantly, decreased mean arterial pressure by 15 +/- 4%, LV end-diastolic diameter by 10 +/- 2%, LV end-systolic diameter by 8 +/- 2%, late diastolic coronary resistance by 22 +/- 7%, and LV dP/dt by 9 +/- 4%. These effects of prazosin were not altered substantially by maintaining heart rate constant with electrical pacing or by pretreatment with beta-adrenergic blockade. However, after chronic reserpine treatment, prazosin did not reduce either mean arterial pressure or late diastolic coronary resistance. The alpha-blocking properties of the drug were established when prazosin attenuated pressure responses to phenylephrine, norepinephrine and bilateral carotid occlusion. Thus, in conscious dogs with heart rate constant, prazosin, by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, induces prolonged coronary vasodilation associated with reductions in the major determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption, e.g., arterial and LV pressures, LV end-diastolic diameter and LV dP/dt.

Increase in MAO-B activity and in the ratio of MAO-B: MAO-A reported by some authors in aging brain and SDAT, however, was not confirmed in human frontal cortex in both Parkinson disease and SDAT. However, the location of both types of MAO in human brain is debatable, since preliminary studies indicate that, unlike in rat brain, MAO-B appears to be the major degradating enzyme of biogenic amines in human brain, while MAO-A might be associated, at least in part, with neuronal structures. Reduction in DAergic parameters in aging brain are also reflected in a decrease of adenylate cyclase activity and of D2 DA receptors. Animal data on decrease of DA-receptor density in the striatum with age were confirmed in human Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease.

Chronic but not acute administration of DMI potentiated the locomotor response to d-amphetamine within a narrow dosage range. The potentiation of the amphetamine response was observed up to 5 days after cessation of chronic DMI but had nearly returned to baseline by 10 days. Neither amphetamine- nor apomorphine-induced stereotypy was affected by chronic DMI. Chronic administration of iprindole but not fluoxetine potentiated amphetamine-induced locomotor activity. Chronic DMI administration did not affect the concentration or distribution of [3H]d-amphetamine in the brain. Furthermore, residual anticholinergic effects of DMI did not appear to be responsible for the potentiated amphetamine response. Chronic administration of DMI did not significantly influence the hypomotility induced by low doses of apomorphine. The increased locomotor activity and rearing produced by moderate doses of apomorphine were significantly increased by chronic DMI administration. The results suggest that chronic DMI may produce supersensitivity of postsynaptic receptors in the mesolimbic DA projection, a system that has been associated with the mediation of amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced increases in locomotor activity.

They also have a beneficial effect in children with hyperkinetic disorders. We found that the dose (-)sulpiride which causes sedation is lower in lead intoxicated animals than in controls. On the contrary, haloperidol produces sedation with the same potency in lead-treated and in control rats. The reported behavioral effects were found to be correlated with biochemical changes. In fact, in lead exposed rats D2 receptors, measured by (-)-[3H]sulpiride stereospecific binding, are altered, while D1 receptors seem not to be affected.

Corticosterone responses to 8-OH-DPAT and DOI were not affected by cocaine exposure. Our data suggest that chronic cocaine produces deficits in presynaptic 5-HT function, and alterations in 5-HT neurotransmission may underlie the dysphoria experienced by abstinent cocaine users.

Steroid induction may reflect primary actions to increase selectively the synthesis of specific proteins, or may be part of broad cellular responses secondary to steroid-induced phenotype transitions. This study examined the cellular mechanisms underlying estrogen and dopaminergic control of lactotroph GK using a quantified immunocytochemical approach. Pituitaries from ovariectomized rats exhibited little GK staining. Estradiol treatment for 10 days produced dose-dependent increases in pituitary mass, the percentage of lactotrophs (indicating lactotroph proliferation) and the percentage of GK-positive cells. Also, GK staining intensity was dependent upon estradiol dose, increasing 4-fold between 5 micrograms and 50 micrograms/48 h. Dopamine receptor blockade with haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg/24 h) elicited weak GK immunostaining in 46% of the lactotrophs in the absence of estradiol, and markedly potentiated GK staining intensity elicited with low but not high doses of estradiol. The results suggest that GK induction is a primary estrogen effect, and is not secondary to a phenotype transition: the induction is enhanced by estrogen-induced lactotroph proliferation. Dopaminergic systems strongly inhibit GK induction by low estradiol levels. This dopaminergic modulation may shift the induction of lactotroph GK to physiological events associated with high estradiol levels or low dopaminergic tone.",,Germany,1993,10.1007/BF00314538,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7507405

In vitro characterization.,Arneric SP and Sullivan JP and Briggs CA and Donnelly-Roberts D and Anderson DJ and Raszkiewicz JL and Hughes ML and Cadman ED and Adams P and Garvey DS and et al ,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,,"A diversity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes has been identified in mammalian brain using recombinant DNA technology. Alterations in the activity of these acetylcholinegated ion channels have been implicated in a number of central nervous system disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The potential therapeutic usefulness of (-)-nicotine [(S)-3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine], the prototypic agonist at nAChRs, is severely limited by side effects that are the result of activation of both cholinergic and noncholinergic pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This study sought to determine the in vitro selectivity of (S)-3-methyl-5-(1methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)isoxazole (ABT 418), a novel analog of (-)-nicotine in which the pyridine ring was replaced with an isoxazole bioisotere, to activate nAChRs. ABT 418 was a potent inhibitor of [3H]-cytisine binding to nAChR in rat brain (Ki = 3 nM) but was inactive (Ki > 10,000 nM) in 37 other receptor/neurotransmitter-uptake/enzyme/transduction system binding assays, including those for alpha-bungarotoxin, muscarinic and 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptors. In PC12 cells, patch-clamp studies indicated that ABT 418 was an agonist with an EC50 value of 209 microM, a potency to activate cholinergic channel currents some 4-fold less than that of (-)-nicotine (52 microM). Channel current responses elicited by ABT 418 were prevented by the cholinergic channel blocker, mecamylamine. ABT 418 was also approximately 10-fold less potent (EC50 value = 380 nM) than (-)-nicotine (40 nM) in increasing [3H]-dopamine release from rat striatal slices, an effect that was blocked by the nAChR antagonist, dihydro-beta-erythroidine (10 microM).2+ In contrast, ABT 418 appeared equipotent with (-)-nicotine in enhancing 86Rb+ flux from mouse thalamic synaptosomes. ABT 418 demonstrated an in vitro pharmacological profile of cholinergic channel activation that was robust at some nAChR, but not others. The reasons for this are unclear. However, a nAChR subtype selectivity may account for the in vitro potency differences of ABT 418 on various neurotransmitter systems, and the substantial separation between the cognitive enhancement/anxiolytic benefits, and the reduced central nervous system side-effect liabilities seen in vivo. ABT 418 represents the first neuronal nAChR ligand that differentiates the toxicities/liabilities and other negative aspects normally associated with liabilities and other negative aspects normally associated with (-)-nicotine from the potential pharmacological benefits of selective cholinergic channel activation.",,United States,1994,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7518514

The effects of calcium ionophore, calcimycin (A23187), on isometric tension were compared in unstimulated rings of intrapulmonary vein with and without endothelium. A23187 (0.1-10 microM) induced concentration-related contraction when endothelium was present. Destruction of endothelium markedly inhibited A23187-induced contraction. Methylene blue, hemoglobin or NG-methyl-L-arginine significantly enhanced A23187-induced contraction only in venous rings with endothelium consistent with attenuation of the contraction by the concomitant release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (nitric oxide) [EDRF(NO)]. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists inhibited, and iproniazid enhanced, contraction elicited by A23187. A23187 induced release of greater amounts of histamine from venous rings with than without endothelium. A23187-induced contraction was not mimicked by the mast cell activator, compound 48/80, and was not inhibited by preexposure to compound 48/80 or in the presence of cromolyn or doxantrazole. A23187-induced contraction was not inhibited by pretreatment with indomethacin, phentolamine, lipoxygenase inhibitors or superoxide dismutase. The results indicate that A23187 induces endothelium-dependent contraction in bovine intrapulmonary vein and support histamine as one major mediator involved. The association of destruction of endothelium with an inhibition of both A23187-induced contraction and histamine release is consistent with the endothelium as a source for histamine which can exert a local vasoconstrictor effect in bovine intrapulmonary vein.",,Netherlands,1994,10.1016/0014-2999(94)90139-2,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7522173

Dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the striatum (caudate-putamen) of rabbit brain declined by about 50 percent as rabbits aged from less than 1 to 4 to 5 years of age. Similar decreases in transmitter-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity were found for histamine as well as for dopamine and norepinephrine in hypothalamus, frontal cortex and anterior limbic cortex. Isoproterenol-stimulated activity was also decreased with age in frontal cortex. These changes appeared to represent decreases in maximal response and not alteration in affinity for amine. In contrast, dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase of retina and transmitter-independent (basal or Gpp(NH)p-stimulated) activity in each of the regions studied were not altered with age. Dopamine receptors in striatum directly assessed by measurement of [3H]-spiroperidol binding revealed a comparable decrease in the number of binding sites without change in ligand affinity. Preliminary data also indicated decreased spiroperidol binding sites in the cortical regions of older animals. These changes in striatum and cortex were evident in the absence of decreases in either dopamine content or choline acetylase activity, an activity presumed to be present in neurons containing dopamine receptors. It is proposed that selective age-dependent decreases in postsynaptic biogenic amine receptor content occur in the absence of, or independent from, neuronal cell loss, possibly by a mechanism involving receptor desensitization. These changes occur in the animal model in those brain regions which in man are thought to be of importance in the loss of cerebral function that is found with senscence.",,United States,1978,10.1007/978-1-4684-8893-7_13,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-753089

The effects of the putative endogenous neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) on the fast extensor and flexor tibiae motor neurons in the locust (Schistocerca gregaria) metathoracic ganglion, were analyzed. 2. 5-HT consistently increased the duration of the fast extensor spike and usually reduced the afterhyperpolarization, although this effect was less consistent. The spike broadening in the fast extensor was associated with an increase in the amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) evoked monosynaptically in the flexor motor neurons by fast extensor stimulation. 5-HT also increased the membrane resistance of the fast extensor and flexor tibiae motor neurons. 3. The effects of 5-HT were mimicked by bath application of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor imipramine, and blocked by the 5-HT receptor antagonist ketanserin. The effects were also mimicked by dibutryl cyclic AMP, a membrane permeant analogue of cyclic AMP, and by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, but not by dibutryl cyclic GMP. The 5-HT-dependent modulation was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor H8. In addition, injection of cyclic AMP into the fast extensor or a flexor motor neuron could mimic the effects of 5-HT on these neurons. 4. 5-HT probably broadened the FETi action potential by modulating potassium conductances responsible for spike repolarization. 5. These results show that 5-HT modulates both the fast extensor and flexor tibiae motor neurons, resulting in potentiation of synaptic transmission between these neurons. In addition, the increase in flexor membrane resistance will potentiate other inputs onto these cells, which will affect the output of the motor neurons during locomotion.",,United States,1995,10.1152/jn.1995.73.3.923,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7541832

Whereas the compound is a dopamine antagonist in vitro and in vivo, its most potent action is antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors, where its affinity is an order of magnitude greater than that observed for dopamine D2 sites. Laboratory and clinical findings have led to a hypothesis that antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain limits the undesirable motor side effects associated with dopamine receptor blockade and improves efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ziprasidone possesses an in vitro 5-HT2A/dopamine D2 receptor affinity ratio higher than any clinically available antipsychotic agent. In vivo, ziprasidone antagonizes 5-HT2A receptor-induced head twitch with 6-fold higher potency than for blockade of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a measure of central dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Ziprasidone also has high affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes, which may further enhance its therapeutic potential. The prediction of antipsychotic efficacy without severe motor side effects is supported by the relatively weak potency of ziprasidone to produce catalepsy in animals, contrasted with its potent antagonism of conditioned avoidance responding and dopamine agonist-induced locomotor activation and stereotypy. The compound is well tolerated in animals at doses producing effective dopamine antagonism in the brain.

Studies have demonstrated that long-term changes in 5-HT levels are associated with alterations in hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) number. However, the effect of short-term manipulations of 5-HT levels on hippocampal corticosteroid receptor levels has not been thoroughly investigated. The present set of studies examined the effect of para-chloroamphetamine (PCA) administration on both short-term and long-term regulation of hippocampal 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor levels. PCA is a selective serotonergic neurotoxin which initially releases 5-HT to cause a short-term depletion of 5-HT stores, followed by a long-term decrease in 5-HT levels which presumably reflects the destruction of 5-HT nerve terminals. In the initial study rats were adrenalectomized and 24 h later injected with PCA (20 mg/kg) and sacrificed 3 h later. PCA produced a large decrease in hippocampal 5-HT (-79%) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (-40%) concentrations. In addition, PCA significantly decreased both hippocampal GR (-28%) and MR (-35%) levels. Pretreatment with fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), which presumably blocks the uptake of PCA into 5-HT nerve terminals, completely blocked the PCA-induced decreases in both 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor concentrations. In a final experiment, the long-term (7 days) effect of PCA administration on hippocampal 5-HT and corticosteroid receptor levels was examined. PCA (10 mg/kg given on 2 consecutive days) was administered to adrenal-intact rats which were adrenalectomized 6 days later and subsequently sacrificed following a 24 h interval. PCA produced an 87% decrease in hippocampal 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, but did not alter hippocampal GR or MR levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Netherlands,1995,10.1016/0006-8993(95)00371-v,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7583200

The results suggest that dopaminergic D1 (but not D2) and glutamatergic NMDA receptors are involved in the primary rewarding properties of cocaine (as assessed by the establishment of CPP) whereas the AMPA/kainate receptors are important only for the behaviour elicited by the stimuli previously associated with the drug action (CPP expression).

Extracellular levels of 5-HT were measured using in vivo microdialysis in the striatum and hippocampus of rats anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Acute administration of fluoxetine transiently elevated the levels of 5-HT in the striatum and hippocampus; desipramine did not change 5-HT levels, and mianserin slightly decreased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus.

A review of the relevant biochemical, in vivo brain microdialysis, electrophysiologic, behavioral, and clinical data clarifies what is known about this unique compound and suggests possible modes of action. METHOD: A panel of 11 experts was convened for a conference to discuss bupropion's mechanism of antidepressant activity. Four of the panelists presented current research findings, followed by a discussion. RESULTS: (1) Biochemical studies suggest down-regulation of postsynaptic beta-adrenoceptors and desensitization of the norepinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the rat cortex occur only after chronic administration of very high doses of bupropion. (2) In vivo brain microdialysis studies demonstrate that, after chronic administration, there is an enhancement of bupropion-induced increases in extracellular dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. (3) Electrophysiologic data show that with acute dosing, bupropion reduces the firing rates of noradrenergic neurons in the locus ceruleus. The firing rates of dopaminergic neurons are reduced by bupropion in the A9 and A10 areas of the brain, but only at very high doses, and bupropion does not alter the firing rates of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe. (4) Behavioral studies show that the most active metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion (306U73), appears to be responsible for a large part of the compound's effects in animal models of antidepressant activity. (5) Clinical studies indicate that bupropion enhances noradrenergic functional activity as reflected by an increased excretion of the hydroxy metabolite of melatonin, while at the same time producing a presumably compensatory decrease in norepinephrine turnover. In one study, bupropion elevated plasma levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid in nonresponders, but not in responders. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of bupropion appears to have an unusual, not fully understood, noradrenergic link. The bupropion metabolite hydroxybupropion probably plays a critical role in bupropion's antidepressant activity, which appears to be predominantly associated with long-term noradrenergic effects. The mild central nervous system activating effects of bupropion appear to be due to weak dopaminergic mechanisms. There is some evidence that dopamine may contribute to bupropion's antidepressant properties. Antidepressant effects of bupropion are not serotonergically mediated.",,United States,1995,,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7665537

In order to elucidate the nature and consequence of PCP actions on glutamatergic and dopaminergic pathways, this study examined the response of extrapyramidal and limbic neurotensin systems to this drug. Multiple, but not single, doses of PCP caused increases in striatal neurotensin-like immunoreactivity content of 150-200% of control. These effects were blocked by the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH 23390, suggesting they were caused by PCP-mediated enhanced dopamine activity at dopamine D1 receptors. In contrast, MK-801 (dizocilpine), a selective NMDA receptor antagonist that acts at the same site as PCP, had no effect on neurotensin-like immunoreactivity content when given alone. In addition, coadministration of MK-801 with PCP did not alter the effect of PCP on striatal neurotensin-like immunoreactivity content. This lack of effect suggests that the actions of PCP on NMDA receptors was not involved in the neurotensin response. The PCP effect on neurotensin striatal pathways also appeared not to be associated with the dopamine D2 or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems: a possible role for the sigma receptor in this effect could not be eliminated. Administration of multiple doses of PCP also affected neurotensin-like immunoreactivity content in the nucleus accumbens (160% compared to control) and frontal cortex (40% compared to control), but not the substantia nigra. The neurotensin effects of PCP are compared to those of another psychotomimetic drug of abuse, methamphetamine.",,Netherlands,1995,10.1016/0014-2999(95)00127-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7672001

Developmental abnormalities could be detected as early as G15 in the brainstem and G19 in the cortex. Because of the importance of fetal serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT1A receptors for the normal development of 5-HT containing neurons, we initiated studies to determine whether administration of a 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, to pregnant rats could overcome the adverse effects of in utero ethanol exposure on the developing serotonergic system in offspring. Female, Sprague-Dawley rats were given daily subcutaneous injections of buspirone (4.5 mg/kg) from gestational day 13 (G13) to G20. 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) content were determined in the cortex and cortical regions. These experiments demonstrated that the ethanol-associated abnormalities in the development of the serotonergic system can be partially overcome by in utero exposure to buspirone. Specifically, whereas untreated ethanol rats had a deficiency of 5-HT and/or 5-HIAA in whole cortex on PN5, and in the motor cortex on PN19 and 35, no significant differences were detected in these regions of the age-matched offspring of buspirone-treated, ethanol-fed rats. In contrast, the 5-HT and 5-HIAA deficiency in the somatosensory cortex of 19-day-old offspring of ethanol-fed rats was not corrected by in utero buspirone treatment. These results suggest that the abnormal development of cortical projections of serotonergic neurons may be due in part to the low fetal 5-HT content in ethanol-exposed rats and may potentially be overcome by in utero treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,England,1993,10.1111/j.1530-0277.1993.tb00734.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7680841

Developmental brain research,,"Phencyclidine (PCP) inhibits the uptake of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), and blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-regulated ion channels. PCP also binds to sigma receptors in vivo and in vitro in rat brain. Prolonged exposure to PCP in adults has been observed to reduce the number of PCP binding sites in brain. We designed these experiments to evaluate whether prolonged prenatal exposure to PCP produces alterations in the development of DA and NMDA systems in brain. To do so, we characterized the normal course of development of basal and stimulated DA release in striatal slices, the ontogeny of striatal DA concentrations, and the development of NMDA receptor channels and associated glutamate binding sites in frontal cortex. We compared these developmental profiles to those in rats exposed to prenatal PCP, in an attempt to characterize the effect of prenatal PCP exposure on the pattern of brain development. Pregnant CD rats were injected s.c. with either 0, 10 or 20 mg/kg PCP daily on gestational days 8 through 20. On postnatal days (PND) 8, 21, 45, or 100, rats were sacrificed and brain tissues isolated for in vitro assessment. In vitro [3H]DA release from striatal slices evoked by either 40 microM glutamate or 15 mM K+ increased over 250% from PND 8 to PND 45, and glutamate-stimulated release was still significantly below adult levels at PND 45.

Tianeptine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated wet dog shakes (WDS) induced by 5-HTP (75 mg/kg, i.p.; 30 min after carbidopa 25 mg/kg, i.p.). The effect was most marked when 5-HTP and tianeptine were given together. The main metabolite of tianeptine also attenuated WDS. Components of the 5-HT syndrome (i.e. reciprocal forepaw treading, hind limb abduction, flat body posture) induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) were unaffected by tianeptine and 5-HTP given both singly or together. However, tianeptine significantly reduced faecal pellet formation but not cage crossings resulting from 8-OH-DPAT administration. These cage crossings but not the associated faecal pellet formation were reduced by 5-HTP. This reduction was prevented by tianeptine. The increase of extracellular 5-HT in the frontal cortex following administration of 5-HTP was opposed and the concurrent increase of extracellular 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was enhanced by tianeptine.

The densities of cortical muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes and corresponding receptor genes m1 through m4, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate glutamate receptor subtypes as well as GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors were measured in rats 1 week after unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (Nbm) applying quantitative receptor autoradiography and in situ hybridization. Ibotenic acid lesion resulted in a striking loss of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) staining in the lesioned Nbm which is associated with a 60% decrease in AChE staining and a 30% reduction in [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding in frontal and parietal cortical regions as well fore- and hindlimb areas ipsilateral to the lesion, being more prominent in the more rostral cortical regions. M1-muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding was not changed in any of the cortical regions studied 1 week after lesion. M2-muscarinic receptor binding levels are slightly increased in the parietal cortex only. The lesion-induced increase in parietal cortical M2-muscarinic receptor binding is complemented by an increase in the hybridization signal for the corresponding m4-mRNA transcript. In cortical regions displaying a reduced activity of AChE and decreased levels of high-affinity choline uptake sites due to forebrain cholinergic lesion, NMDA receptor binding was markedly reduced in comparison to the unlesioned brain side whereas AMPA and kainate binding has been significantly increased in these regions. Muscimol binding to GABAA receptors was increased in the rostral portions of frontal and parietal cortices as compared with the unlesioned brain side. Binding levels of benzodiazepine receptors were not affected by the lesion in any of the cortical regions studied. The differential changes in glutamate and GABA receptor subtypes following lesion might be regarded as the consequence of a cortical reorganization compensating for the reduced cholinergic presynaptic input. The data further suggest that presynaptic cortical cholinergic deficits might affect both glutamatergic and GABAergic functions with different intensity and different directions.",,Netherlands,1994,10.1016/0006-8993(94)90514-2,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7704621

Rat hippocampal slices or synaptosomes were labeled with [3H]noradrenaline and exposed to NMDA or glutamate in superfusion. NMDA (100 microM) elicited a remarkable rise (about 500%) in the release of [3H]noradrenaline from slices. The effect of NMDA was antagonized by the glutamate receptor blocker, kynurenic acid. The antagonism by 100 microM kynurenate was reduced by submicromolar concentrations of oxiracetam and totally reversed by 1 microM of the drug. The concentration-antagonism curve for kynurenic acid was shifted to the right in the presence of 0.2 or 1 microM oxiracetam. Aniracetam and D-cycloserine, as well as glycine and D-serine, behaved similarly to oxiracetam: all compounds, tested at 1 microM, reversed the antagonism by 100 microM kynurenate of the NMDA-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release. In superfused hippocampal synaptosomes, 100 microM NMDA or glutamic acid elicited the release of [3H]noradrenaline; the evoked release was enhanced by glycine, but not by oxiracetam. In this preparation 1 microM glycine or 1 microM oxiracetam prevented the antagonism by kynurenate of the NMDA- or the glutamate-evoked [3H]noradrenaline release. As kynurenic acid is an endogenous glutamate receptor antagonist whose brain levels are known to increase in conditions associated to cognitive deficits, it is proposed that the putative cognition enhancers tested may act in vivo by relieving the antagonism produced by excessive endogenous kynurenate.",,Netherlands,1995,10.1016/0014-2999(94)00641-j,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7713164

The administration of L-DOPA to the normal rats elevated the regional CCK8-like immunoreactivity (CCK8LI) tissue levels in a dose dependent manner in the frontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens where CCK neurons were closely associated with DA neurons but not in the hippocampus where CCK neurons were identified as local circuit neurons. Moreover, coadministration of D2-selective antagonist, L-sulpiride, with L-dopa inhibited the elevation of CCK8LI levels in several brain regions. This evidence indicates that CCK8 release was inhibited by exogenous DA converted from L-dopa via D2 receptor stimulation. In the 6-OHDA treated rats on the 3rd day after the treatment, the L-dopa administration elevated the CCK8 levels in several regions. However, the elevation of CCK8LI levels was not observed on the 7th day after the 6-OHDA treatment. These results suggest that there would be a great difference in the effect of L-DOPA on CCK8LI levels between the 3rd day and 7th day after 6-OHDA treatment.

Isolated, left ventral lobes of the rat prostate were removed and examined for in vitro contraction. Norepinephrine-induced contraction of the rat prostate was competitively blocked by prazosin with an apparent antagonist dissociation constant (pKB) of 8.13. 5-HT also contracted the rat prostate. However, in the presence of prazosin, maximum 5-HT contraction was reduced by half suggesting that high concentrations of 5-HT can activate alpha 1 receptors in the prostate.

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and therapeutic efficacy in depression and coexisting anxiety and depression.",Wilde MI and Benfield P ,Drugs,,"Tianeptine is a novel antidepressant agent, both structurally (modified tricyclic) and in terms of its pharmacodynamic profile. Unlike other antidepressant agents, tianeptine stimulates the uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in rat brain synaptosomes and rat and human platelets, increases 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in cerebral tissue and plasma, and reduces serotonergic-induced behaviour. Tianeptine reduces the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress, antagonises stress-induced behavioural deficits and prevents changes in cerebral morphology. The antidepressant efficacy of tianeptine, as shown in 2 trials of patients with major depression or depressed bipolar disorder with or without melancholia, is greater than that of placebo. In patients with major depression without melancholia or psychotic features, depressed bipolar disorder or dysthymic disorder, the antidepressant efficacy of short term (4 weeks to 3 months) tianeptine therapy appears to be similar to that of amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine and may be superior to that of maprotiline in patients with coexisting depression and anxiety. However, submaximal dosages of amitriptyline and maprotiline were used in these studies. Preliminary evidence suggests that tianeptine may also be effective in patients with endogenous depression. Progressive therapeutic improvements have been observed with up to 1 year of tianeptine treatment, and long term therapy may reduce the rate of relapse or recurrence. Tianeptine is effective in the treatment of depression in elderly and post-alcohol-withdrawal patient subgroups. Tianeptine was more effective in reducing psychic anxiety than placebo in patients with major depression or depressed bipolar disorder with or without melancholia. The overall anxiolytic properties of tianeptine in patients with coexisting depression and anxiety appear to be similar to those of amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine and may be superior to those of maprotiline, although submaximal dosages of amitriptyline and maprotiline were used. Studies of tianeptine in patients with primary anxiety have not been conducted. Tianeptine is well tolerated in the short (3 months) and long (up to 1 year) term. The incidence of dry mouth (38 vs 20%), constipation (19 vs 15%), dizziness/syncope (23 vs 13%), drowsiness (17 vs 10%) and postural hypotension (8 vs 3%) are greater with amitriptyline than with tianeptine. Insomnia and nightmares occur in more tianeptine than amitriptyline recipients (20 vs 7%). The relative lack of sedative, anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects with tianeptine makes it particularly suitable for use in the elderly and in patients following alcohol withdrawal; these patients are known to have increased sensitivity to the adverse effects associated with psychotropic drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,New Zealand,1995,10.2165/00003495-199549030-00007,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7774514

Haloperidol was able to prevent this effect of amphetamine. Ondansetron, a selective and potent 5HT3 receptor antagonist, was also shown to be effective at blocking the amphetamine-induced disruption of LI at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg, but not at 0.1 mg/kg. In addition, it was demonstrated that ondansetron could enhance LI; using only ten preexposures, no LI was obtained in the saline group, but was apparent in animals given ondansetron, an effect which has been previously shown with haloperidol. Haloperidol, at the higher dose used, reduced suppression of licking, however, ondansetron at the effective dose had no such effect.

In contrast to amphetamine, the only neuroeffector response altered by cocaine sensitization was a decrease in convulsive threshold to kainate. The persistence of the change in convulsive threshold correlated with the persistence of behavioral sensitization. The induction of sensitization was blocked by pretreatment with four different classes of drugs, represented by haloperidol, dizocilpine, diltiazem and DNQX. These results suggest that the mechanism of induction to cocaine is similar to that of amphetamine; both the glutamate and dopaminergic systems appear to be involved in induction. The expression of the sensitized cocaine response was blocked by haloperidol, CPP and diltiazem. These results differed from those obtained previously insofar as CPP did not affect the expression of sensitization to amphetamine.

By use of this system in combination with a microdialysis technique, the effect of ketamine on the binding and release of dopamine was investigated. The administration of ketamine (5 mg/kg) caused sedation accompanied by psychotic symptoms such as nystagmus and stereotyped movements of extremities. During this psychotomimetic period produced by ketamine, a significant increase in the accumulation of the dopamine D2 receptor ligand N-[11C]methylspiperone was observed in the striatum compared with the level in the conscious state, while no significant change was observed in the frontal cortex and cerebellum. In contrast to the use of ketamine as the anesthetic, pentobarbital (25 mg/kg), which produced deeper anesthesia but no psychotic symptoms, caused a decrease in the accumulation of N-[11C]methylspiperone in the striatum. Kinetic analysis, conducted by a graphical method, revealed that the value of the association constant (K3) for N-[11C]methylspiperone binding in the striatum was increased to approximately 130% by ketamine and decreased to approximately 70% by pentobarbital compared with the control values. Furthermore, the release of dopamine from the striatum measured by microdialysis was not affected by ketamine anesthesia. These results indicate that ketamine facilitates striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission through increasing the binding activity of dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, and suggest that these changes may be related to the psychotomimetic behavioral symptoms of this drug.",,Netherlands,1994,10.1016/0006-8993(94)91263-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7874501

This laboratory has demonstrated a significant role for dopamine (DA) as a modulator of gastrointestinal function and disease. Using models of both acute (ethanol restraint stress; cysteamine) and chronic (iodoacetamide-induced gastritis) gastroduodenal mucosal injury, as well as tests of gastric secretory function (conscious basal gastric acid secretion; pylorus ligation; ex vivo gastric chamber), we have shown that DA, particularly DA1/D1 receptor agonists are powerful gastroprotective agents. This action is demonstrable upon peripheral administration as well as central (particularly intramesolimbic) administration. DA1/D1 agonists such as SKF38393 and SKF75670C reduce experimental gastric mucosal injury and secretion while antagonists of these receptors, including SCH23390, worsen experimental gastroduodenal lesions and augment secretion. That there exists a significant central component to DA-induced gastroprotection is demonstrated by data showing that rats assessed as anxiety prone, develop a greater degree of experimentally induced gastric damage, require greater amounts of DA agonists for 50% gastroprotection and respond to exogenous stress challenge with greater central DA turnover and loss, relative to rats assessed as low in anxiety. Very recently, we showed that dopamine D4 receptor blockade by clozapine and activation of dopamine D3 receptors by 7-hydroxy-N, N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OHDPAT) are also associated with antiscretory and gastroprotective effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Australia,1994,10.1111/j.1440-1746.1994.tb01299.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7881016

Supplementum,,"The pharmacological inhibition of excitatory amino acid neurotransmission has evolved to be a major topic in neuropharmacology since enhanced synaptic action of glutamate and possibly other related neurotransmitters has been suggested to play a role both in acute neurological conditions such as ischemia and epilepsy and in chronic degenerative neurological diseases including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. While antagonists at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors include psychotomimetic and neurotoxic agents such as phencyclidine and MK-801, the aminoadamantanes represent a class of drugs which may be largely free of such actions and which have already been used clinically as antiviral and antiparkinsonian agents. Multiple in vitro studies have recently delineated the neuroprotective properties of amantadine, and of its more potent congener, memantine, which appear to mediate neuroprotection via inhibition of NMDA receptor-dependent glutamate activity. Thus, neuroprotection targeting glutamate receptors does apparently not have to be associated with prominent psychotogenicity, and the development and evaluation of new neuroprotective drugs will have to performed in consideration both of the relative safety and of the good clinical effect of the already known and established aminoadamantanes.",,Austria,1994,,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7884411

Minislices of the ventral portion of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (vBNST) were used to study the release of endogenous NA. High K+ induced a Ca(2+)-dependent and reserpine-sensitive release of NA. Clonidine (1 microM), an alpha 2-noradrenergic receptor agonist, significantly decreased K(+)-induced release of NA, whereas yohimbine (1 microM), an alpha 2-noradrenergic antagonist, increased this release. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), a specific agonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, evoked the release of NA from vBNST minislices. In the presence of D-serine (10 microM), an agonist at the glycine site associated with the NMDA receptor, the NMDA effect was significantly higher. Glycine (1 microM) also increased NA release evoked by NMDA. However, glycine exhibited a significant effect by itself, suggesting the existence of strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors in vBNST. Endogenous NA release induced by 40 mM K+ and NMDA was not additive. Thus, vBNST minislices seem to be a good model to study the release of endogenous NA in the CNS.

Antidepressant administration of desipramine to rats twice-daily for 2 weeks increased hippocampal TNF levels and transformed the presynaptic TNF response. One day of desipramine administration resulted in increased locus coeruleus TNF mRNA accumulation and, simultaneously, hippocampal TNF levels escalated. The fractional release of [3H]norepinephrine during field stimulation of control hippocampal slices was decreased by the addition of TNF in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect which was potentiated by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. While no change in sensitivity to TNF was observed in the hippocampus after one day of desipramine administration, TNF enhanced, rather than inhibited [3H]norepinephrine release after 14 days. In addition, TNF potentiation of [3H]norepinephrine release after chronic desipramine administration was reversed in the presence of idazoxan to a greater inhibition than in control slices exposed to idazoxan. Therefore, TNF-induced regulation of [3H]norepinephrine release appears to be associated with an alteration of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor responsiveness.

8f3ac51a-b2da-4af2-8c68-d4805e789eed,[Neuroleptics and serotonin].,Hery F and Hamon M ,L'Encephale,,"To date, there is no doubt that dopamine plays a key role in the behavioural disorders associated with schizophrenia. However, dopamine is not the only neurotransmitter involved in this syndrome, as it interacts with many neuronal systems in brain. Of special interest is the interaction between dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems with evidence from pharmacological data in animals that each of these systems may exert an inhibitory influence on the other. Furthermore, the psychotomimetic effects of drugs affecting serotoninergic neurotransmission such as LSD, psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine also contributed to draw attention onto a possible involvement of serotoninergic systems in at least some of the disorders typical of schizophrenia. This idea received strong support from recent studies on the multiple receptors for serotonin in the central nervous system. These studies not only demonstrate the existence of several classes of serotonin receptors called 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4, but led also to the development of novel agonists and antagonists for the stimulation or blockade of each of them. Pharmacological investigations with these ligands revealed that serotonin is probably involved in the behavioural disorders associated with schizophrenia through its binding to three distinct classes of receptors: 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 (or the closely related class 5-HT1C) and 5-HT3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,France,1993,,English Abstract and Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7905821

To examine the role of dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) on working memory, we injected dopamine antagonists (SCH23390, SCH39166, haloperidol, sulpiride, and raclopride) locally into the dorsolateral PFC in two monkeys trained to perform an oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task. In the ODR task, monkeys fixate a central spot on a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor while a visual cue is briefly (300 ms) presented in one of several peripheral locations in the visual field. After a delay of 1.5-6 s, the fixation spot is turned off, instructing the monkey to move its eyes to the target location that had been indicated by the visuospatial cue before the delay. Each monkey also performed a control task in which the cue remained on during the delay period. In this task the monkey's response was sensory rather than memory guided. 2. Local intracerebral injection of the selective dopamine antagonists SCH23390 (10-80 micrograms) and SCH39166 (1-5 micrograms) and/or the nonselective dopamine antagonist haloperidol (10-100 micrograms) induced deficits in ODR task performance at a total of 22 sites in the dorsolateral PFC. The deficit was characterized by a decrease in the accuracy of the memory-guided saccade as well as an increase in the latency of the response. The deficit usually appeared within 1-3 min after the injection, reached a peak at 20-40 min, and recovered at 60-90 min. 3. Performance change was restricted to a few specific target locations, which varied with the injection site and were most often contralateral to the injection site. 4. The degree of impairment in the ODR task occasioned by the injection of the dopamine antagonists was sensitive to the duration of delay; longer delays were associated with larger decreases in the accuracy and delayed onset of the memory-guided saccade. 5. The deficit was dose dependent; higher doses induced larger errors and increases in the onset of the memory-guided saccade. 6. Dopamine antagonists did not affect performance on the control task, which required the same eye movements but was sensory guided. Thus, in the same experimental session in which ODR performance was impaired, the accuracy and the latency of the sensory-guided saccades were normal for every target location.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,United States,1994,10.1152/jn.1994.71.2.515,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-7909839

This hypothesis has been validated with several reference anxiogenic drugs (dexamphetamine, pentylenetetrazole, yohimbine, idazoxan) which increased thigmotaxis; and with anxiolytic drugs (buspirone, phenobarbital), which reduced it. On this test the selective or non-selective indirect dopamine agonists GBR 12783, dexamphetamine and cocaine induced an increase of thigmotaxis.

Low concentrations (1-3 microM) of 5-HT selectively attenuated polysynaptic potentials that were similarly evoked by callosal or white matter stimulation. Maximally effective concentrations of 5-HT blocked interhemispheric transmission by 50-90%, as evidenced by an attention of the short latency callosal depolarizing synaptic potential (e-DPSP). These effects of 5-HT were not associated with a change in membrane potential or input resistance. The e-DPSP was characterized as having an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and a non-NMDA component; the non-NMDA component was attenuated by 5-HT. Attenuation of the synaptic potential was accompanied by an attenuation of a postsynaptic glutamate potential. Suppression of both the e-DPSP and the glutamate potential was concentration dependent with 10-100 microM being maximally effective. The 5-HT1A/2 antagonist, spiperone, antagonized the effects of 5-HT on synaptic and glutamate potentials. Spiperone (1 microM) shifted the concentration-effect curves for suppression of the e-DPSP and the glutamate potential to the right; however, the Kb for the glutamate potential concentration-effect curve was 10 times that for the e-DPSP curve.

687cedcc-4c51-419e-900a-cda96bf63b34,Pharmacological manipulations of the alpha 2-noradrenergic system. Effects on cognition.,Coull JT ,Drugs & aging,,"Electrophysiological and neurosurgical lesion studies with experimental animals have implicated the ascending dorsal noradrenergic bundle of the locus coeruleus system in cognitive process such as memory, learning and selective attention. However, it has also been suggested that noradrenaline (norepinephrine) is crucial in certain cognitive functions associated with the frontal lobes, particularly the prevention of distractibility by irrelevant stimuli. The alpha 2-receptors of the prefrontal cortex appear to be of particular importance in this respect. Studies with humans and experimental primates provide substantial support for this view. The aged primate brain is prone to degeneration of the locus coeruleus, as well as profound catecholamine depletion in the prefrontal cortex, and so is ideal for psychopharmacological investigation of the role of noradrenaline in frontal lobe function. Elderly monkeys show deficits in performance of the delayed response task, which can be reversed directly by both the mixed alpha 1/alpha 2-agonist clonidine, the more specific alpha 2-agonist guanfacine and also, indirectly, by the alpha 2-antagonist yohimbine. It is suggested that these results can be explained by an attenuation of the distracting properties of irrelevant stimuli following stimulation of noradrenergic activity. Conversely, distractibility is magnified whenever noradrenergic activity is reduced. This is supported by similar findings in psychopharmacological studies of healthy humans. The exception to this is when the locus coeruleus is likely to be firing, e.g. in times of stress or when novel stimuli are encountered. Clonidine attenuates locus coeruleus firing on such occasions, and so counteracts any beneficial (or deleterious) effects of stress on task performance. alpha 2-Adrenoceptor agents have little therapeutic value in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type.

The consequences of such 5-HT receptor changes on neuronal responsiveness to 5-HT and corresponding receptor agonists were assessed with a quantitative iontophoretic approach. For comparative purposes, similar data were also obtained from rats 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned as adults, showing severe neostriatal dopamine denervation but no 5-HT hyperinnervation. In controls, 5-HT and its receptor agonists, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP; 5-HT1B/2C agonist) and dimethoxy-iodophenyl-aminopropane (DOI; 5-HT2A/2C agonist), depressed the firing rate of a majority of the unit tested. Three months after neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesion (5-HT-hyperinnervated tissue), inhibitory responses to all three agents were significantly increased and comparable results were obtained for 5-HT and DOI in the rostral versus caudal neostriatum. After 6-hydroxydopamine lesion in adults, neither responsiveness to 5-HT, mCPP or DOI nor the density of 5-HT1B or 5-HT2A binding were significantly different from control. Thus, the up-regulation of 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A and possibly 5-HT2C receptors accompanying the 5-HT hyperinnervation after neonatal but not after adult dopamine denervation was associated with increased responsiveness (IT50) of neostriatal neurons to iontophoresed 5-HT and its receptor agonists. Under these conditions, neostriatal 5-HT transmission might be enhanced in spite of a basal release seemingly comparable to normal (Jackson and Abercrombie, 1992, J.

This review focuses on the effects of sex steroids on dopaminergic activity in extrahypothalamic brain areas. Among sex steroids, estrogens have been most extensively investigated, and many studies report that estrogens affect behaviors mediated by the basal ganglia, such as in humans suffering from extrapyramidal disorders. Epidemiological and clinical evidence also suggests an influence of estrogens on the vulnerability threshold for schizophrenia and sex differences in the clinical expression of this disease. Clinical observations point to a role of androgenic hormones in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. In normal humans, sex steroids were also shown to influence motor and cognitive performance. Biochemical and behavioral studies in animals have also shown the effect of sex steroids on dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia; however, both activating and inhibiting effects have been reported. This may partly be explained by effects of the dose, duration of treatment, interval between steroid administration and testing the behavior measured, and the part of the basal ganglia from which the behavior is elicited. In view of the numerous variables that influence net dopaminergic response to steroids, focus will be on the literature using similar experimental conditions to assess the effect of in vivo chronic steroid treatment, acute short-term steroid treatment and the estrous cycle as well as in vitro effects of steroids on dopamine receptors. These experimental paradigms point to two general mechanisms of action of steroids: a rapid short-term non-genomic membrane effect and a slower long-term possibly genomic effect of steroids on dopamine systems. Combining dopaminergic drugs with sex steroids could improve efficacy or reduce side effects associated with these drugs. Examples of such combined treatments in rats and monkeys are presented for delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cocaine, neuroleptics, apomorphine and L-DOPA. A better understanding of steroid-dopamine interactions and the possible isolation of conditions to have only pro or anti dopaminergic activity could then be used to develop combined therapies or to optimize drug treatments that would take into account the patient's sex and endocrine status.",,Germany,1994,10.1515/revneuro.1994.5.1.27,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8019704

The role of the NMDA receptor and its glycine modulatory site was investigated in a rat conditioned stress model. Behavioral, neuroendocrine, and neurochemical analyses were conducted. Regional dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) utilization was assessed by postmortem tissue measurements of metabolite-to-parent neurotransmitter ratios. Rats were conditioned to fear a tone previously paired with footshock. The following day, rats were systemically administered saline or the NMDA glycine site antagonist (+)-HA-966 before exposure to thirty minutes of conditioned stress. Conditioned stress resulted in a selective increase in medial prefrontal cortical DA and 5-HT utilization, elevation in serum corticosterone, and freezing behavior in control animals. The conditioned stress-induced increase in DA utilization in control animals was also detected in the lateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, whereas DA utilization was not affected in the perirhinal or cingulate cortices, lateral-basolateral amygdaloid complex, anterior ventromedial caudatoputamen, or posterior dorsolateral caudatoputamen. Pretreatment with (+)-HA-966 at 15 mg/kg completely abolished the conditioned stress-induced increase in DA utilization in the medial and lateral prefrontal cortices. This effect was regionally specific since (+)-HA-966 pretreatment did not block increased DA utilization in the nucleus accumbens. This effect was also neurochemically specific since the stress-induced increase in 5-HT utilization in the medial prefrontal cortex was not affected by (+)-HA-966 pretreatment. Pretreatment with (+)-HA-966 did not affect stress-induced serum corticosterone elevation but did attenuate the freezing response. Control experiments demonstrated that (+)-HA-966 pretreatment did not (1) induce sedation, (2) interfere with habituation to a novel environment, (3) alter basal DA, 5-HT, or serum corticosterone levels, or (4) block acquisition of aversive memories.

Although several ""BAT ligands"" are known that bind selectively to PCP site 2 and not to PCP site 1 (such as indatraline), these compounds have low affinity for site 2 (Ki values > 1 microM).

Adaptive changes in serotonin (5-HT) receptor functioning appears to play an important role in mediating the action of various antidepressant treatments. We investigated the adaptive changes in behavioral sensitivity of the 5-HT receptor subtype following 4 weeks of swimming exercise in normal rats, as well as in an animal model of depression (3 week, variety of chronic stressors). 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity was assessed by hyperphagic response induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg, IP); 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptor by 5-HT syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.75 mg/kg, IP), and 5 Me-ODMT (5 mg/kg, IP); and 5-HT2 receptor by wet dog shakes response induced by quipazine (1 mg/kg, IP) and 5MeODMT (5 mg/kg, IP).

Exercise, given prophylactically along with chronic stressors, was able to prevent the development of behavioral deficit in the open-field test, and the animals developed remarkably enhanced sensitivity of 5-HT2 receptors.

In a previous study (Salzman et al., 1991b) a single 1-mg/kg i.v. dose of mianserin improved multiple measures of functional outcome when given 15 min after injury, whereas higher doses (5 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) displayed lesser therapeutic actions as well as pulmonary depressant effects. In these studies, lower dosages of minanserin (0.5 and 0.1 mg/kg i.v.) also were not associated with neuroprotection. Although the 1-mg/kg i.v. dosage again displayed significant efficacy when administered at 15 min delaying treatment to 30 min resulted in only marginal therapeutic actions. Nonetheless, i.p. dosage of 10 mg/kg (but not 2.5 mg/kg) at 15 min retained therapeutic efficacy, suggesting a pharmacodynamic influence. In support of this conclusion, the intrathecal administration of a 50-fold lower dose of minanserin (0.006 mg) at 15 min after injury resulted in neuroprotection that was superior to that of peripheral doses and was retained when this intrathecal dosage was administered at 1 hr after trauma. These results suggest a central mechanism of action for mianserin.

This was associated with an elevation in hypothalamic and median eminence stores of dopamine (DA) that was related to the dose of alcohol given. Pituitary stalk transection (PST) resulted in a significant rise in plasma PRL levels compared to sham control animals, which suggests that DA in the hypophysial portal blood exerted an inhibitory influence on pituitary PRL secretion. The DA agonist bromocriptine failed to alter mean plasma LH levels in stalk-transected rats. The ETOH-treated castrated rats showed a significant rise in circulating PRL after injection of the DA receptor antagonist haloperidol metabolite II (HAL), but the administration of the DA receptor agonist R(-)-apomorphine HCL (APO) caused plasma PRL to decline to near undetectable levels. Plasma LH levels remained unchanged in the HAL- and APO-treated rats and were similar to those of sham controls. These results suggest that lactotroph DA receptors were still functional.

In the present study, we examined one potential mechanism underlying this effect: the ability of insulin to inhibit norepinephrine (NE) reuptake and secondarily increase its synaptic concentration. Acute (20 min) insulin treatment (0.1-10 nM) significantly inhibited specific 3H-norepinephrine uptake by rat hypothalamic slices. To ascertain whether this is a direct effect of insulin on cells that can synthesize and release norepinephrine, we studied NE uptake by the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line. In PC12 cells, insulin (0.5-10 nM) inhibited NE uptake whereas the related peptide, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), did not. Insulin did not compete with 3H-mazindol (a ligand for the NE reuptake transporter) binding to PC12 cell membranes. Thus, this effect of insulin is not due to interaction with either IGF-1 receptors or the norepinephrine transporter, but may be due to insulin interaction with its own receptor. Chronic (96-h) insulin treatment of PC12 cells also resulted in an inhibition of 3H-norepinephrine uptake, and membranes prepared from cells chronically treated with insulin bound less 3H-desipramine than control membranes. Thus, chronic insulin treatment may result in a decrease in the numbers of membrane-associated transporters. We conclude that insulin has a direct and physiological role in the modulation of synaptic norepinephrine levels by modulating reuptake by cells that synthesize and release norepinephrine.",,United States,1993,10.1016/0361-9230(93)90210-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8221132

The increment in activity due to dopamine was enhanced in the presence of GPP(NH)P. The AC was also stimulated by 0.2-0.4 mM Ca2+ in the presence of 0.2 mM EGTA; at 0.8 mM Ca2+ had little or no influence on basal or NaF-stimulated activity. However, as Ca2+ concentration was increased from 0.2 to 0.8 mM stimulation by dopamine or GPP(NH)P was progressively inhibited. These results suggest a possible function of Ca2+ in modulating neurotransmitter stimulation of AC in the monkey frontal cortex. The AC exhibited higher sensitivity to dopamine than to norepinephrine or isoproterenol; however dopamine and norepinephrine caused the same maximum stimulation of the enzyme, a stimulation womewhat greater than that produced by isoproterenol. An additivity in stimulating AC was observed for dopamine and isoproterenol but not for dopamine and norepinephrine. Norepinephrine- or dopamine-stimulated AC was effectively blocked by fluphenazine and other dopamine-receptor blocking agents (relative potency for blockade; fluphenazine, haloperidol greater than clozapine, thioridazine greater than pimozide) but not by propranolol, a beta-receptor blocker. In contrast, isoproterenol-stimulated AC was antagonized by propranolol or alprenolol but not by fluphenazine. On the basis of these results, at least two distinct receptors appear to be associated with AC of monkey frontal cortex: (1) a beta-receptor stimulated by isoproterenol and (2) a new type of dopamine or dopamine-norepinephrine receptor, stimulated by either dopamine or norepinephrine. This latter system differs from more typical dopamine receptors found in caudate, retina and limbic cortex in that (a) it is not stimulated by 1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzyl)-4-(2-pyrimidinyl) piperazine (S584); (b) it is stimulated significantly by the putative alpha-receptor agonist, clonidine; (c) it is more sensitive to blockade by clozapine than primate retina or caudate; also the sensitivity to haloperidol is greater than has been reported for non-primate caudate; (d) it is very sensitive to stimulation by norepinephrine and to blockade by phentolamine (an alpha-receptor blocker).",,Netherlands,1976,10.1016/0006-8993(76)90492-3,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-824023

This method measures receptor-stimulated GTP binding to individual alpha subunits. GTP binding is associated with two protein bands following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The bands, 40- and 45-kDa in size, comigrate with the alpha subunits of Gi/Go and Gs, respectively. Binding of [alpha-32P]GTP is saturable and Mg(2+)-dependent. Nucleotides compete with [alpha-32P]GTP binding in the following order: GTP > GDP > Gpp(NH)p > App(NH)p. Dopamine stimulates [alpha-32P]GTP labeling of the 40- and 45-kDa bands. A binding increase of 300-400% is observed at 10 microM dopamine. Isoproterenol (10 microM) stimulates [alpha-32P]GTP binding only to the 45-kDa protein band. The effects of dopamine and isoproterenol are blocked by their respective receptor antagonists, fluphenazine and propranolol. The individual G proteins activated by dopamine are resolved by immunoprecipitation of stimulated [alpha-32P]GTP binding to G alpha s, G alpha i, and G alpha o with specific anti-G alpha antisera. Dopamine stimulates [alpha-32P]GTP binding to G alpha s and G alpha i while the labeling of G alpha o was not significantly changed. Pertussis toxin-mediated ADP ribosylation prevents the activation of G alpha i which is mediated by dopamine receptor stimulation. The methods described are useful in defining the coupling of specific neurotransmitter receptors to specific G proteins in native membranes. These procedures also allow measurements of receptor stimulation of individual G proteins in intact biological membranes.",,United States,1993,10.1006/abio.1993.1473,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8250222

Compared with the authors' previously reported results in C57BL/6 mice, these effects were significantly greater in hippocampus (80-90% vs. 60%) and of a similar magnitude in frontal cortex (60-75%). A long-term study showed that cortical and hippocampal 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and NE were still decreased 40% to 50% 6 months after treatment. Regional brain dopamine was essentially unchanged during the 6-month period. Pretreatment with the 5-HT-selective uptake inhibitors, fluoxetine or paroxetine, or with the NE-selective uptake inhibitor, desipramine, prevented decreases in cortical and hippocampal 5-HT and NE, respectively, 3 weeks after 2'-NH2-MPTP (4 x 20 mg/kg). In addition, pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase type-A inhibitor, clorgyline, also prevented the more modest decreases in 5-HT and NE caused by 4 x 15 mg/kg 2'-NH2-MPTP. Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase-B inhibitor, did not provide similar protection. Lastly, 2'-NH2-MPTP administered 3 weeks earlier, abolished hypothermia caused by the serotonin agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, which provided preliminary evidence for an associated functional change in the central serotonergic system. Together, these data suggest that 2'-NH2-MPTP is a novel agent capable of producing long-lasting depletions in forebrain 5-HT and NE but not dopamine in two different strains of mice by some mechanisms that resemble those of the parent dopamine-depleting neurotoxin, MPTP.",,United States,1993,,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8263805

Although HPP+ was less potent than MPP+ on the dopaminergic system, the two compounds displayed comparable toxic effects on the serotonergic system. HPP+ also proved to be a weaker inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration than MPP+ in vivo as measured by increases in extracellular lactate levels. On the other hand, HPP+ was a more potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration in vitro than MPP+, with IC50 values of 12 microM (HPP+) and 160 microM (MPP+). Quantitative estimations established that the concentrations of the more hydrophobic HPP+ in the brain tissues surrounding the microdialysis probe were less than those of MPP+ after comparable perfusions. Consequently, the inherent toxicity of HPP+ relative to MPP+ may be greater than suggested by the results observed in the microdialysis experiments.

The administration of MK801 (0.1 mg/kg, SC) to rats produced an intense stimulation of coordinated locomotor activity, which was not associated with stereotyped behavior. This stimulatory response was inhibited by pretreatment with either reserpine (5 mg/kg, IP) or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (2 doses of 250 mg/kg, IP). Similarly, pretreatment with the D2 antagonist eticlopride (0.03 mg/kg, SC) or the D1 antagonist SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg, SC) produced a marked inhibition of MK801-stimulated hypermotility, and the combination of eticlopride (0.03 mg/kg, SC) and SCH23390 (0.03 mg/kg, SC) produced a greater inhibition of MK801-stimulated locomotion than either agent alone.

The response of the hamster circadian system to photic stimuli is also altered during senescence. Decreased monoamine levels, receptor sites and neuronal populations are commonly observed in the aging brain. The objective of the present study was to determine if monoamine depletion with reserpine in young hamsters induces changes in the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity similar to those that occur spontaneously with aging. Wheel-running activity of 12 young hamsters under a 14 h-light/10 h-dark cycle was continuously monitored. The total activity level, the times of activity onset, peak and offset and the duration of activity were determined during a 1-week period after vehicle treatment and for three 1-week periods after reserpine treatment (4 mg/kg). A second group of eight reserpine-treated and six vehicle-treated animals was kept in constant darkness (DD). The period of the circadian activity rhythm in DD and the phase-shifts after short light pulses at circadian time 19 (CT19) were determined in the control and reserpine-treated groups.

Neurotransmitters released from nerve endings are inactivated by re-uptake into the presynaptic nerve terminals and possibly into neighbouring glial cells. While analysing the functional properties of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the hypothalamus, we observed a high-affinity uptake process for noradrenaline in postsynaptic peptidergic neurones. 2. In primary hypothalamic cell cultures and in a hypothalamic neuronal cell line, [3H]-prazosin bound with high affinity and was displaced by unlabelled prazosin in concentrations of 10(-10) to 10(-7) M. However, at concentrations of unlabelled prazosin above 10(-7) M, there was a paradoxical increase in apparent [3H]-prazosin binding. 3. Methoxamine, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor ligand that is not subject to significant neuronal uptake, displaced [3H]-prazosin but did not cause the paradoxical increase in the apparent binding of [3H]-prazosin. Cooling the cells to 4 degrees C reduced the total amount of prazosin associated with the cells; under these conditions, methoxamine almost completely inhibited [3H]-prazosin binding to the cells. 4. In the presence of desipramine (DMI), unlabelled prazosin displaced [3H]-prazosin as before, but no paradoxical increase in apparent binding was seen above 10(-7) M. 5. The paradoxical increase of [3H]-prazosin binding was not observed in membrane preparations of hypothalamic neurones. These findings indicated that the paradoxical increase in apparent [3H]-prazosin binding was due to a cellular uptake process that becomes evident at high concentrations of the ligand. 6. DMI (10(-5) M) had no effect on the specific binding of [3H]-prazosin. The presence of alpha1-adrenoceptors was confirmed by binding of [125]-HEAT, but [3H]-idazoxan (an alpha2- ligand) did not bind to the cells.7. The uptake of prazosin obeyed the Michaelis-Menten model, with similar Km and Vmax values in both types of cultures.8. Noradrenaline was taken up with high affinity by both types of cultures. (+/-)-[3H]-noradrenaline uptake was reduced by DMI and by excluding sodium from the medium, indicating that this process has some of the properties of uptake 1. (+/-)-[3H]-noradrenaline uptake in the cell line was unaffected by testosterone.9. The measured uptake of (-)-noradrenaline in the cell line was considerably increased by blockade of catechol-omicron-methyl-transferase and monoamine oxidase, suggesting that (-)-noradrenaline is metabolized to lipophilic products that escape across the plasma membrane.10. Studies in rats, in which the noradrenaline isomer 6-hydroxydopamine was used, suggested that the post synaptic uptake process is operative in hypothalamic CRH and vasopressin neurones in vivo.11. The Km for (-)-noradrenaline was within the range for the high affinity uptake, process in noradrenergic neurones. Uptake takes place in concentrations at which noradrenaline activates alpha1-adrenoceptors.Removal of noradrenaline from the vicinity of the receptors may prevent desensitization,thus maintaining the responsiveness of postsynaptic neurones to the actions of the neurotransmitter.",,England,1993,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1993.tb13570.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8358534

While 5-HT transporter mRNA is abundantly expressed in the midbrain raphe complex, lower concentrations were also found in frontal cortex, hippocampus, and neostriatum using a combination of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Southern hybridization, and sequence analysis. Long-term administration of antidepressants which inhibit 5-HT reuptake, but not monoamine oxidase inhibitors or 5-HT receptor agonists, decrease 5-HT transporter mRNA steady-state concentrations. Based on these observations, we conclude that (1) mRNA coding for the 5-HT transporter is present in several brain areas associated with ascending HT pathways, and (2) chronic treatment with reuptake inhibiting antidepressants may be associated with regulation of the 5-HT transporter at the level of gene expression which may contribute to the neuroadaptive mechanisms that likely underlie their therapeutic efficacy.",,Netherlands,1993,10.1016/0169-328x(93)90069-2,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8381906

In the present study, we have investigated the various intracellular mechanisms that are associated with the action of dopamine on frog pituitary melanotrophs. Dopamine reduced forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and the inhibitory effect of dopamine was blocked by the dopaminergic D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride. The D2 receptor agonist apomorphine inhibited incorporation of [3H]inositol into membrane phospholipids. Dopamine also inhibited the formation of inositol trisphosphate and provoked accumulation of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. The inhibitory effect of dopamine on inositol trisphosphate production was mimicked by D2 receptor agonists and blocked by sulpiride. Using a double-wavelength microfluorimetric approach, we found that dopamine caused a rapid and transient decrease in K(+)-evoked stimulation of intracellular calcium concentration. The time-courses of the responses of the various intracellular messengers indicate that blockage of voltage-dependent calcium channels is the primary event associated with activation of dopamine D2 receptors, while inhibition of polyphosphoinositide breakdown, related to blockage of voltage-dependent calcium channels, and reduction of cAMP production are secondary events which may contribute to the sustained inhibitory effect of dopamine on alpha-MSH release.",,England,1993,10.1677/joe.0.1360421,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8386214

The 5-HT-releasing drug fenfluramine significantly reversed HAL-induced catalepsy. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and buspirone potently and dose-dependently reversed HAL-induced catalepsy. The effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin was blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist pindolol, but not the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin. The 5-HT1C/2 receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine also completely reversed HAL-induced catalepsy, an effect blocked by ketanserin, but not pindolol. Neither antagonist alone had any effect. The 5-HT1B/1C receptor agonist trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine only partially reversed HAL-induced catalepsy, and the effect was not dose dependent. The 5-HT1C/2 receptor antagonist mianserin reversed HAL-induced catalepsy on its own; therefore, its ability to block the effect of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine could not be tested. The nature of the disruption of HAL-induced catalepsy was examined by measuring the ability of increasing doses of HAL to surmount the effects of the serotonergic agonists. The mixed DA-D1/D2 receptor agonist apomorphine shifted the dose-effect curve for HAL to the right in a parallel manner, indicative of a competitive interaction between HAL and apomorphine at the D2 receptor. In contrast, the 5-HT receptor agonists flattened the dose-effect curve for HAL, suggestive of noncompetitive interactions. These data suggest that the 5-HT receptor agonists are not reversing HAL-induced catalepsy by indirectly increasing DA release. Rather, the agonists reverse HAL-induced catalepsy through interactions at their specific 5-HT receptor subtypes.

In order to establish whether this effect is associated with an increase in cortical noradrenaline release, rats were treated for 1, 3 or 21 days with clorgyline (2 mg/kg i.p. single injection; 1 mg/kg i.p. repeated injections), and the frontal cortex was then perfused by microdialysis in the awake animal. Control animals were injected with saline. The concentration of noradrenaline in the microdialysate increased only slightly after 1 or 3 days of clorgyline treatment but increased fourfold over control levels after 21 days treatment. Yohimbine (20 mumol/l) added to the perfusing solution caused a similar degree of enhancement in microdialysate noradrenaline concentration in all groups of rats. Tetrodotoxin (10 mumol/l) reduced noradrenaline concentration to low levels in all groups of animals, but noradrenaline was still detectable in the microdialysate in rats treated with clorgyline for 21 days. Concentrations of the deaminated metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, dihydroxyphenylglycol and methoxy-hydroxyphenylglycol were lowest after the 21 day clorgyline treatment. Determination of enzyme activity ex vivo showed that MAO-A was inhibited more than 95% by all clorgyline treatments with less than 10% inhibition of MAO-B. The results indicate that cerebrocortical noradrenaline release increases gradually during chronic MAO inhibition.

Studies undertaken over the last decade have shown that factors are present in in brain extacts, cerebrospinal fluid and plasma that impede the transport of tritiated 5HT into cortical tissue and platelets. 2. While the precise nature of these substances is presently unknown, it has been hypothesized that they may play a role in the aetiology of the affective disorders. 3. A preliminary study is described in which the plasma from untreated depressed patients was shown to impair the 5HT induced platelet aggregation, and 3H-5HT uptake, of control subjects. The effect of this factor on platelet 5HT aggregation appears to be diminished following the recovery of the depressed patients. 4. The results of these and other studies suggest that endocoids are present in the depressed patient that could be causally responsible for the defects in serotonergic function that is commonly associated with the disease. 5. The efficacy of antidepressant treatments may therefore be related to their ability to counteract the effect of such endocoid(s).",,England,1993,10.1016/0278-5846(93)90001-9,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8395698

The possible involvement of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the inotropic and electrophysiological responses to endogenous noradrenaline released by tyramine was examined in rabbit papillary muscles. 2. A concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect was produced by tyramine. This effect of tyramine was not observed in muscles from rabbits pretreated with reserpine. 3. The positive inotropic effect of tyramine was greatly inhibited by propranolol, but not altered by prazosin. However, when beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by pretreatment with propranolol, tyramine still produced a positive inotropic effect, an effect which was antagonized by prazosin. 4. Tyramine caused a decrease in action potential duration (APD) and an increase in action potential amplitude in a concentration-dependent manner. Isoprenaline also produced the same electrophysiological effects. These electrophysiological effects of both agents were inhibited by propranolol. 5. When beta-adrenoceptors were blocked by propranolol, the observed prazosin-sensitive positive inotropic effect of tyramine was not accompanied by any change in APD. In contrast, APD was markedly prolonged by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation with phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol, in association with the positive inotropic effect. 6. It is concluded that in rabbit papillary muscles, endogenous noradrenaline causes a positive inotropic effect predominantly mediated by beta-adrenoceptors, but can still evoke a positive inotropic effect through alpha 1-adrenoceptors when beta-adrenoceptor stimulation is eliminated. This suggests that the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated positive intropic mechanism(s) may be masked by simultaneous activation of beta-adrenoceptors. In addition, this study indicates that APD prolongation is not involved in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic responses to endogenous noradrenaline.",,England,1993,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1993.tb13754.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8401934

METHODS: Changes in isometric tensions were recorded in helical strips of the arteries with and without the endothelium. RESULTS: Histamine predominantly produced relaxations in EOA and IOA, partially contracted with prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha. The relaxation of IOA almost was abolished by treatment with cimetidine (10(-5) mol/l), whereas the response of EOA was partially attenuated by treatment with cimetidine or chlorpheniramine (10(-6) mol/l) and was abolished with their combined treatment. Endothelium denudation depressed the relaxation in EOA but did not affect the response of IOA. The response to histamine of EOA was inhibited by treatment with indomethacin (10(-6) mol/l) or tranylcypromine (10(-4) mol/l), a PGI2 synthesis inhibitor, only when the endothelium was present, but additional treatment with chlorpheniramine did not further inhibit relaxation. On the other hand, IOA's response to histamine was not inhibited by indomethacin, despite the presence of endothelium. CONCLUSIONS: The histamine-induced relaxation in EOA may be associated with the release of vasodilator PGI2 through the activation of H1 receptors in the endothelium and with the direct action on H2 receptors in smooth muscle, whereas the relaxation in IOA is mediated exclusively by H2 receptors in smooth muscle.",,United States,1993,,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8425838

Other studies have also demonstrated the presence of dopamine (DA) and DA metabolites as well as of DA receptors in the ventral cord. There is also evidence for the implication of DA in the control of motor functions at the spinal level. The occurrence of a dopaminergic innervation in the ventral horn has been, however, disputed until recently. But recent work has demonstrated that the motoneural cell groups in the ventral horn (lamina IX) are a target for descending dopaminergic fibers. In addition, the possibility that DA is a mediator of primary afferent fibers has also been postulated. Finally, the occurrence of dopaminergic cell bodies has been suggested in the spinal cord. This indicates that DA is probably implicated in a complex manner in spinal functions. In the present paper the possible involvement of DA in sensory and in motor functions at spinal level will be discussed in view of neurochemical observations made in polyarthritic rats, in which pain-related behavior and reduction of locomotor activity associated with a marked decrease in mobility, are observed.",,United States,1993,10.1016/0361-9230(93)90259-e,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8457880

Administration of brofaromine (1-100 mg/kg, s.c.) a type AMAO inhibitor, dose-dependently decreased DOPAC and mHPAA levels. pHPAA levels were decreased by 100 mg/kg brofaromine, but PAA levels were unaffected. Doses of deprenyl of less than 100 mg/kg, i.p., had no effect on any of the acids, while 100 mg/kg decreased DOPAC, mHPAA and pHPAA but not PAA levels. Clorgyline, pargyline and tranylcypromine treatment decreased the levels of DOPAC, mHPAA and pHPAA but not PAA. Administration of alpha-monofluoromethyldopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase, decreased the levels of all four acids. It was concluded that deamination of the respective parent amine by type A MAO is primarily responsible for the synthesis of DOPAC and mHPAA, but that another pathway contributes to pHPAA synthesis.

Inhibition of 5-HT uptake in-vivo by 403U76 was demonstrated by potentiation of the behavioural effects of 5-hydroxytryptophan in rats and mice and blockade of p-induced depletion of 5-HT in rats. The firing of 5-HT-ergic dorsal raphe neurons in rats was decreased after intravenous administration of low doses of 403U76 as would be predicted for a 5-HT uptake inhibitor. 403U76 antagonized tetrabenazine-induced sedation, an effect associated with inhibitors of noradrenaline uptake, but not with inhibitors of 5-HT uptake. Thus 403U76 affects noradrenergic as well as 5-HT-ergic neurotransmission in-vivo. Potential anxiolytic activity was indicated by reductions in isolation-induced vocalizations in neonates after 403U76 treatment. Low intravenous doses of 403U76 were well tolerated and had no sustained cardiovascular effects. There were no deleterious behavioural side-effects at active doses. Effects observed on isolated tissues or transmitter receptors occurred only at very high concentrations and were pharmacologically unimportant.

Limitation of infarct size by preconditioning is associated with marked slowing of ischemic metabolism. The cause of metabolic slowing has not been determined but may involve either pro- or anti-adrenergic mechanisms. Hypothetically, adrenergic stimulation could signal the adaptive response. Alternatively, metabolic slowing during the sustained ischemic challenge could occur through a reduction in beta-adrenergic stimulation. This study was designed to test the role of cardiac norepinephrine (NE) in PC. METHODS: The effect of PC on myocardial infarct size was studied in control dogs and dogs depleted of catecholamines by pretreatment with reserpine (RES; 0.25 mg/kg i.v.). PC was induced by four cycles of 5 min of ischemia and 5 min of reperfusion. Infarcts were produced by 60 min of ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion. Cardiac NE depletion was verified by radioimmunoassay of tissue samples and by absence of hemodynamic response to a tyramine bolus (1.4 mg/kg) administered at the end of each experiment. Infarct size, expressed as percent of area at risk, was controlled for variation in collateral blood flow using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: Adjusted mean infarct size was 25.5 +/- 3.2% in untreated controls vs. 19.1 +/- 3.3% in RES-treated controls (P = NS). PC limited infarct size in untreated dogs (7.4 +/- 1.8 vs. 25.5 +/- 3.2%; PC vs. control; P < 0.01) but not in RES-treated dogs (15.7 +/- 3.0% vs. 19.1 +/- 3.3%; RES + PC vs. RES; P = NS). Infarct size was larger in dogs with RES + PC than with PC alone, even though there was a trend toward a slight beneficial effect with RES alone. CONCLUSION: The cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning cannot be explained entirely as an anti-adrenergic effect. On the contrary, adrenergic receptor stimulation may be required for the full expression of ischemic preconditioning in canine myocardium.",,England,1995,10.1016/0008-6363(95)00074-7,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8595609

Separate groups of rats learned to lever-press when reinforced with microinjections of dizoclipine (MK-801) or 3-((+/-)2-carboxypiperazin-4yl)propyl-1-phosphate (CPP), drugs known to block NMDA receptor function but not dopamine uptake, into the same region. Each drug was ineffective or markedly less effective when injected at a slightly more dorsal and lateral site in the core of nucleus accumbens. Self-administration of PCP, MK-801, or CPP directly into nucleus accumbens was not altered by co-infusion of a dose of the dopamine antagonist sulpiride that effectively blocked intracranial self-administration of the dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine, suggesting that the rewarding actions of the NMDA receptor antagonists are not dopamine-dependent. Rats also developed lever-pressing habits when PCP, MK-801, and CPP were each microinjected directly into frontal cortex, a region previously associated with the rewarding actions of cocaine but not nomifensine. Thus nucleus accumbens and frontal cortex are each potential substrates for the rewarding properties of PCP and related drugs, and the ability of these drugs to disrupt NMDA receptor function seems sufficient to account for their rewarding actions.

In order to explore the location of these receptors, we injected (0.5 mul) the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (13.3 nmol) or dopamine (26.4 nmol) topically into the anteroventral third ventricular region or the paraventricular nucleus of rats, and their effects on the levels of plasma vasopressin and its controlling factors were examined in the presence or absence of an osmotic stimulus. The effects of haloperidol injections into the ventral tegmental area were also tested to study whether information associated with drinking behavior may affect the osmotic vasopressin secretion. Intravenous infusion (0.1 ml kg-1 body wt min-1) of hypertonic saline (2.5 mol/l) enhanced plasma vasopressin 15 and 30 min later, and this was accompanied by an augmentation of plasma osmolality, sodium and chloride, and by elevated or unaltered arterial pressure. The vasopressin response was abolished by haloperidol injection into the anteroventral third ventricular region 10 min before the beginning of the hypertonic saline infusion. The injection sites were confirmed histologically to have been in or near the organum vasculosum of the laminae terminalis and a ventral part of the median preoptic nucleus. Similarly, a partial but significant reduction of the vasopressin response was noted after bilateral injections of haloperidol into the ventral tegmental area, whereas bilateral haloperidol injections into the paraventricular nucleus had no appreciable effect. The responses of plasma osmolality, electrolytes and arterial pressure to the osmotic load were not affected significantly by haloperidol injections into the anteroventral third ventricular region, ventral tegmental area or the paraventricular nucleus. The iv infusion of isotonic saline (0.15 mol/l) did not change plasma vasopressin and the other variables significantly, and this was also the case when preceded by application of haloperidol into the anteroventral third ventricular region, ventral tegmental area or the paraventricular nucleus. Dopamine injection into the anteroventral third ventricular region increased plasma vasopressin 5 min later, without affecting plasma osmolality, electrolytes or arterial pressure. On the basis of these results, we concluded that dopamine receptors responsible for facilitatory roles in osmotically stimulated vasopressin secretion may exist in the anteroventral third ventricular region and ventral tegmental area.",,England,1996,10.1530/eje.0.1340243,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8630527

Binding was tested in the presence of 3 microM (+/-)-pindolol, a concentration higher than previously suggested for the same purpose (0.1 micron). This higher concentration was, however, needed to fully saturate 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors without interaction with 5-HT7 receptors. Under these conditions, [3H]5-HT binding could be further inhibited with methiothepin (used to determine nonspecific binding) and with 5-HT, with an IC50 of 1.4 nM and a slope of 1. The inhibition curves of (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin, ritanserin, and mianserin were shallow (slopes, 0.35-0.58) and could be better analyzed with the two-site model, indicating that the pindolol-insensitive [3H]5-HT binding sites in rat hypothalamic membranes are heterogeneous. Although the IC50 of the compounds tested suggests that one population of sites is actually associated with 5-HT7 receptors, our data clearly indicate that this binding assay does not selectively label 5-HT7 receptors in native tissues.

The aim of the present experiment was to characterize nicotine-evoked [3H]-noradrenaline ([3H]-NA) release from rat superfused hippocampal synaptosomes, using striatal [3H]-dopamine release for comparison. 2. (-)-Nicotine, cytisine, DMPP and acetylcholine (ACh) (with esterase inhibitor and muscarinic receptor blocker) increased NA release in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 6.5 microM, 8.2 microM, 9.3 microM, and 27 microM, respectively) with similar efficacy. 3. Nicotine released striatal dopamine more potently than hippocampal NA (EC50 0.16 microM vs. 6.5 microM). (+)-Anatoxin-a also increased dopamine more potently than NA (EC50 0.05 microM vs. 0.39 microM), and maximal effects were similar to those of nicotine. Isoarecolone (10-320 microM) released dopamine more effectively than NA but a maximal effect was not reached. (-)-Lobeline (10-320 microM) evoked dopamine release, but the effect was large and delayed with respect to nicotine; NA release was not increased but rather depressed at high concentrations of lobeline. High K+ (10 mM) released and NA to similar extents. 4. Addition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake blocker, citalopram (1 microM) to hippocampal synaptosomes affected neither basal NA release nor nicotine-evoked release. 5. The nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine (10 microM), virtually abolished NA and dopamine release evoked by high concentrations of nicotine, ACh, cytisine, isoarecolone, and anatoxin-a. Although NA release evoked by DMPP (100 microM) was entirely mecamylamine-sensitive, DMPP-evoked dopamine release was only partially blocked. Dopamine release evoked by lobeline (320 microM) was completely mecamylamine-insensitive. 6. The nicotinic antagonists dihydro-beta-erythroidine and methyllycaconitine inhibited nicotine-evoked dopamine release approximately 30 fold more potently than NA release. In contrast, the antagonist chlorisondamine, displayed a reverse sensitivity, whereas trimetaphan and mecamylamine did not preferentially block either response. None of these antagonists, given at a high concentration, significantly altered release evoked by high K+. 7. Blockade of nicotine-evoked transmitter release by methyllycaconitine and dihydro-beta-erythroidine was surmounted by a high concentration of nicotine (100 microM), but blockade by mecamylamine, chlorisondamine, and trimetaphan was insurmountable. 8. Nicotine-evoked NA release was unaffected by tetrodotoxin, whereas veratridine-evoked NA release was virtually abolished. 9. We conclude that presynaptic nicotinic receptors associated with striatal dopamine and hippocampal NA terminals differ pharmacologically. In situ hybridization studies suggest that nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones express mainly alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 2 nicotinic cholinoceptor subunits, whereas hippocampal-projecting noradrenaline (NA) neurones express alpha 3, beta 2 and beta 4 subunits. Pharmacological comparisons of recombinant receptors suggest that release of hippocampal NA may be modulated by receptors containing alpha 3 and beta 4 subunits.",,England,1996,10.1111/j.1476-5381.1996.tb15232.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8646402

In this study we have tested the hypothesis that dopaminergic malfunction is a critical component in disulfiram-evoked neurotoxicity. Disulfiram antagonized the in vitro striatal binding of [3H]tyramine, a putative marker of the vesicular transporter for dopamine, and the uptake of [3H]dopamine into striatal synaptic vesicles, with inhibitory constants (Ki) in the range of reported blood dithiocarbamate levels in treated alcoholics. Furthermore, disulfiram provoked a loss of radioactivity from [3H]dopamine-preloaded striatal vesicles, when added directly to the incubation mixture. Several metal-containing fungicide analogs were also potent displacers of specifically bound [3H]tyramine. Diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), the major metabolite of disulfiram, had none of these effects. The intraperitoneal injection of a high dose of disulfiram and DDC into rats, mimicking acute intoxication, induced in vivo overflow of striatal dopamine from both a reserpine-sensitive (vesicular) and an alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine-sensitive (cytoplasmic) pool. The vesicular component of in vivo dopamine release resulted mainly from a direct activity of disulfiram, on the organelles (interaction with the carrier for dopamine plus membrane permeabilization) and indirectly through the mediation of serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors. DDC acted poorly at the vesicle membrane, and the in vivo releasing effect of dopamine was only partially prevented by the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors, thus suggesting the role of additional mechanisms. It is concluded that disulfiram intoxication may acutely disrupt dopamine balance, an effect probably underlying some of the central neurotoxic, extrapyramidal symptoms associated with dithiocarbamate overdose.",,United States,1996,10.1006/taap.1996.0147,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8685891

However, when (S)-UH-301 was administered 30 min before citalopram the maximal increase in 5-HT levels was approximately 400%. In rats chronically treated with citalopram (20 mg/kg/day i.p. for 14 days) basal 5-HT concentrations in the frontal cortex were significantly increased and 5-HIAA concentrations were decreased when measured 10-12 h, but not 18-20 h, after the last injection of citalopram, as compared to basal 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in chronic saline-treated rats. When (S)-UH-301 (2.5 mg/kg s.c.) was administered 12 h, but not 20 h, after the last dose of citalopram it produced a significantly larger increase in extracellular concentrations of 5-HT than in control rats. However, in rats pretreated with a single, very high dose of citalopram, 20 mg/kg i.p., administration of (S)-UH-301 at 12 h after citalopram did not increase 5-HT levels. The augmentation by (S)-UH-301 of the increase in brain 5-HT output produced by acute administration of citalopram is probably due to antagonism of the citalopram induced feedback inhibition of 5-HT cells in the DRN, as previously suggested. However, the capacity of (S)-UH-301 to further increase the already elevated extracellular concentrations of 5-HT in brain in animals maintained on a chronic citalopram regimen, in which significant tolerance to the initial feedback inhibition of DRN-5-HT cells and developed, represents a novel finding. Generally, the reduced feedback inhibition of 5-HT neurons obtained with chronic citalopram treatment, and the associated elevation of brain 5-HT concentrations, may be related to functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the DRN. This phenomenon may also largely explain the larger increase in 5-HT output produced by (S)-UH-301 in chronic citalopram treated animals as compared to its effect in control animals. Yet, a contributory factor may be a slight, remaining feedback inhibition of the 5-HT cells caused by residual citalopram at 12, but not 20 h after its last administration. Previous clinical studies suggest that addition of a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist to an SSRI in the treatment of depression may accelerate the onset of clinical effects. Moreover, in therapy-resistant cases maintained on SSRI treatment, addition of a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist may improve clinical efficacy. Since the therapeutic effect of SSRIs in depression has been found to be critically linked to the availability of 5-HT in brain, our experiments results support, in principle, both of the above clinically based notions.",,Germany,1996,10.1007/BF00167182,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8738296

Tardive dyskinesia is more important in postmenopausal women than men of comparable age and a peak of first episodes of schizophrenia is observed in postmenopausal women. The effect of ovariectomy (2 weeks or 3 months) in rats was investigated as a model of decreased gonadal function associated with menopause. 2. Frontal cortex D1 receptor density and affinity were similar in intact male compared to intact female rats and progressively decreased in density with time after ovariectomy, with no change of affinity. Striatal D1 and D2 receptors also decreased in density after ovariectomy for both receptor subtypes, with no change of affinity. Striatal D1 receptor density and affinity were similar in intact male and female rats, whereas the density of D2 receptors was higher in females. Treatment with estradiol for 2 weeks restored the D2 but not the D1 receptor changes. 3. In the substantia nigra pars reticulata, striatum, nucleus accumbens, and entopeduncular nucleus, a progressive increase in [3H]flunitrazepam specific binding associated with GABAA receptors was observed as a function of time following ovariectomy; this was corrected with estradiol treatment. In contrast, the opposite was observed for [3H] flunitrazepam binding in the globus pallidus, where ovariectomy decreased binding, which was corrected with estradiol replacement therapy. 4. Low prefrontal cortex dopamine activity with implications of D1 receptors in negative symptoms of schizophrenia is hypothesized. Furthermore, GABAergic overactivity in the internal globus pallidus-substantia nigra pars reticulata complex is hypothesized in tardive dyskinesia. 5. The present data suggest that gonadal hormone withdrawal by reducing brain dopamine receptors and producing an imbalance of GABAA receptors in the output pathways of the striatum may predispose to schizophrenia and dyskinesia.",,United States,1996,10.1007/BF02088176,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8743969

Effects on the serotonin system, especially serotonin-2 receptors, may contribute to clozapine's atypicality. We injected rats for 14 days with clozapine (25 mg/kg/day) or haloperidol (2 mg/kg/day), and measured three aspects of the serotonin system in forebrain regions: abundance of serotonin-2A, -2C and -1A receptor messenger RNAs by in situ hybridization histochemistry; serotonin-2A and -1A binding sites using receptor autoradiography, and levels of serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid with high-performance liquid chromatography. Clozapine administration decreased serotonin-2A receptor messenger RNA and the density of [3H]ketanserin binding in cingulate and frontal cortex, but not in piriform cortex. Serotonin-1A receptor expression and serotonin-2C receptor messenger RNA were unchanged in all areas. The treatment markedly decreased serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations in striatum with similar trends in cortex and hippocampus. Haloperidol administration did not affect the expression of the three serotonin receptors, but was associated with a modest reduction of striatal and hippocampal 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. The selective reduction of serotonin-2A receptors confirms earlier findings and supports the view that this receptor may have relevance for the actions of clozapine. The fact that the encoding messenger RNA is decreased shows that the the effect is mediated at the level of gene expression. In contrast, the unchanged serotonin-2C receptor messenger RNA level indicates that the reported loss of serotonin-2C receptors after clozapine treatment is due to translational or post-translational events.

However, their exact roles and their interrelationship are not completely understood. Antidepressants have various effects on the body, including action at the neuronal synapses of the brain; the two most important of these effects are blockade of the reuptake of neurotransmitters, including NE, 5-HT, and dopamine, and blockade of certain neurotransmitter receptors. Currently available antidepressants may be classified as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase or as blockers of biogenic amine neurotransmitter reuptake, the latter best describing tricyclic antidepressants and selective 5-HT-reuptake inhibitors, because they block the reuptake of one or more neurotransmitters. However, recently introduced antidepressants, such as the 5-HT-NE-reuptake inhibitors, have synaptic effects that differ from those of older compounds. These synaptic effects are important in explaining certain side effects and drug-drug interactions associated with all classes of antidepresants.

We used a newly developed single photon emission computerized tomography method to measure amphetamine-induced dopamine release in the striatum of fifteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen healthy controls. Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was estimated by the amphetamine-induced reduction in dopamine D2 receptor availability, measured as the binding potential of the specific D2 receptor radiotracer [123I] (S)-(-)-3-iodo-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]benzamide ([123I]IBZM). The amphetamine-induced decrease in [123I]IBZM binding potential was significantly greater in the schizophrenic group (-19.5 +/- 4.1%) compared with the control group (-7.6 +/- 2.1%). In the schizophrenic group, elevated amphetamine effect on [123I]IBZM binding potential was associated with emergence or worsening of positive psychotic symptoms. This result suggests that psychotic symptoms elicited in this experimental setting in schizophrenic patients are associated with exaggerated stimulation of dopaminergic transmission.

There is general agreement that the antipsychotic action of most if not all neuroleptic drugs is related to their tendency to interact with one or several members of the receptor families for the neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin. Currently, dopamine receptor subtypes belonging to the D2 family and several serotonin receptor subtypes are a focus of interest. Receptor effects are induced almost immediately upon the initiation of acute neuroleptic treatment and are generally proportional to the drug concentration in the tissue. Recent work has shown that the expression of neuropeptide genes, immediate early genes and genes for specific subtypes of glutamate receptors is stimulated in distinct regions of the brain during chronic treatment with neuroleptic drugs. These effects appear on time-scales that are similar to the relatively slow induction of antipsychotic action and are therefore of particular interest. In order to understand the mechanisms behind the latency for antipsychotic action these neurobiological correlates must be clarified. The effects can be regarded as a secondary cascade of events, probably initiated and maintained by receptor effects. In the present review, direct effects of neuroleptic drugs on monaminergic receptor subtypes are summarized together with their indirect effects on monoamine release and gene expression.

The above effects of ipsapirone were mimicked by buspirone (2.5 and 5 mg/kg), another 5-HT1A receptor agonist, but not 1-PP (1-pyrimidinylpiperazine, 5 mg/kg)-a centrally active metabolite of ipsapirone.

Following acute administration of dexmedetomidine, loss of righting reflex and changes in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and norepinephrine turnover in different brain regions (locus coeruleus and hippocampus) were assessed. In separate experiments, the effect of dexmedetomidine on 5-HT turnover was measured in rats rendered tolerant to the hypnotic effects of dexmedetomidine. These neurochemical data were complemented by a study of dexmedetomidine-induced hypnotic response in the presence of a 5-HT2 receptor agonist and antagonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and ritanserin, respectively. Dexmedetomidine (1-500 micrograms.kg-1) dose dependently reduced 5-HT and norepinephrine turnover in both the locus coeruleus and hippocampus. The decrease in 5-HT turnover more closely correlated with the dose-response curve for loss of righting reflex, a behavioral measure of hypnosis, than did the norepinephrine turnover. In previous studies with chronic administration of dexmedetomidine (3 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 7 days), the norepinephrine turnover effect of acute dexmedetomidine (30 micrograms.kg-1) persisted while the hypnotic effect was blunted. Following the same regimen, the drug's ability to diminish 5-HT turnover was also blunted. This biochemical evidence for the role of 5-HT in sleep was supported by the behavioral evidence that dexmedetomidine (100 micrograms.kg-1 i.p. or 7 micrograms.0.2 microliter-1 locus coeruleus)-induced hypnosis was dose dependently blocked by DOI (0.08-0.32 mg.kg-1 i.p.). The selectivity of this effect was demonstrated by the finding that ritanserin (0.16 mg.kg-1 i.p.) pretreatment blocked the effects of DOI (0.16 mg.kg-1 i.p.) on dexmedetomidine (100 micrograms.kg-1 i.p. or 7 micrograms.0.2 microliter-1 locus coeruleus)-induced loss of righting reflex. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the hypnotic effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, dexmedetomidine, is not mediated solely by changes in noradrenergic neurtransmission, but instead is strongly associated with a decrease in serotonergic neurotransmission and correspondingly diminished by stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors.",,Netherlands,1996,10.1016/0014-2999(96)00194-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8813614

Estrogen exerts profound effects on mood, mental state and memory by acting on both ""classical"" monoamine and neuropeptide transmitter mechanisms in brain. Here we review an example of each type of action. 2. With respect to the effect of estrogen on central monoamine neurotransmission, low levels of estrogen in women are associated with the premenstrual syndrome, postnatal depression and post-menopausal depression. Sex differences in schizophrenia have also been attributed to estrogen. Previous studies have shown that estrogen stimulates a significant increase in dopamine2 (D2) receptors in the striatum. Here we show for the first time that estrogen also stimulates a significant increase in the density of 5-hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) binding sites in anterior frontal, cingulate and primary olfactory cortex and in the nucleus accumbens, areas of the brain concerned with the control of mood, mental state, cognition, emotion and behavior. These findings explain, for example, the efficacy of estrogen therapy or 5-HT uptake blockers such as fluoxetine in treating the depressive symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome. and suggest that the sex differences in schizophrenia may also be due to an action of estrogen mediated by way of 5-HT2A receptors. 3. With respect to the effect of estrogen on central neuropeptide transmission, estrogen stimulates the expression of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in rodents. This results in a 100-fold increase in AVP mRNA in the BNST and a massive increase in AVP peptide in the BNST and its projections to the lateral septum and lateral habenula. The BNST-AVP system enhances and/or maintains ""social"" or ""olfactory"" memory, and thus provides a powerful model for correlating transcriptional control of neuropeptide gene expression with behavior. Whether similar mechanisms operate in the human remain to be determined. 4.

The 5-HT1A receptors were labelled in total cortex membrane homogenates with [3H]8-OH-DPAT, and the monoamines measured in cingulate cortex by high-performance liquid chromatography. As expected, after pargyline administration tissue concentrations of 5-HT, noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) were markedly increased due to MAO inhibition with a concomitant decrease of the metabolites 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid and homovanillic acid. However, neither desipramine nor fluoxetine changed monoamine concentrations. Saturation binding with [3H]8-OH-DPAT revealed that, for the control animals (saline treated), the curves were best fitted to a 2-site model. Following drug administration, the saturation curves were still best fitted to a 2-site model, with no changes in affinities or bonding capacities. In competition experiments with 5-HT, buspirone, and pindolol, the curves were always best fitted to a 2-site model. Following fluoxetine administration, the inhibition curves revealed decreases in the affinity of the low-affinity site (KiL) for the agonist buspirone, and in the relative proportion of these sites. In addition, following pargyline, there was an increase in the affinity of the high-affinity site (KiH) for 5-HT but with a decrease of the relative proportion of high-affinity sites. The results confirm that [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding is to a 2-site model, and reveal an absence of downregulation of 5-HT1A receptors following increases in tissue 5-HT after MAO inhibition or antidepressant administrations.

While D2 blockade occurs rapidly, reduction in psychotic symptoms is often delayed. This time discrepancy has been attributed to the relatively slow development of depolarization inactivation (DI) of dopaminergic neurons. The reduced firing rates associated with DI has been hypothesized to reduce dopamine release and thus psychotic symptoms. Studies assessing changes in dopamine release during chronic neuroleptic treatment, using microdialysis and voltammetry, have been inconsistent. This may be due to methodological differences between studies, the invasive nature of these procedures, or other confounds. To investigate the effects of DI on dopamine release, 3-MT accumulation, an index of dopamine release that does not involve disruption of brain tissue, was measured during acute and chronic neuroleptic treatment. These results are compared with those using other techniques. 3-MT levels remained elevated after chronic treatment, suggesting that DI does not markedly reduce release. Regulation of dopamine release during DI was examined using two techniques known to block dopamine neuronal impulse flow. 3-MT levels were markedly reduced by both, implying that DI does not alter the portion of dopamine release mediated by neuronal impulse flow. Overall, studies to date suggest that the delayed therapeutic effects of neuroleptics are not due to reductions in impulse dependent dopamine release. Recent studies using a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia have pointed to altered pre- and post-synaptic indices of dopamine neurotransmission. The results suggest that neuroleptics may exert their therapeutic effects, in part, by limiting the fluctuations in dopamine release, and raise new issues for future research.",,Austria,1996,10.1007/BF01273358,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8872864

However, there is little certainty regarding interactions of the two systems in brain. We now report that triiodothyronine is concentrated in both nuclei and projection sites of central noradrenergic systems. Immunohistochemical mapping of the hormone revealed the following: (1) Locus coeruleus and all other noradrenergic cell groups identified were the most prominently labeled neural centers in the brain. (2) The hormone was also concentrated in the widely dispersed targets of noradrenergic projections. (3) Triiodothyronine labeling in noradrenergic target cells was most prominent over the cell nuclei, indicating that the hormone was bound to its receptors. Therefore, targets of noradrenergic innervation should be responsive to triiodothyronine. (4) Unlike that in noradrenergic target cells, triiodothyronine staining was decidedly perikaryal in locus coeruleus (A-6) and the other A-1 to A-7 cell groups; the staining pattern in locus coeruleus cytosol and processes was heavy, clumped and similar to that seen in contiguous sections immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase. Results of radio-immunoassay, immunoabsorption and pharmacological tests demonstrated the specificity of the antibody for triiodothyronine and ruled against cross-reactivity with norepinephrine or its metabolites as the basis for the staining reactions. Although other possibilities consistent with these new observations are given consideration, it appears that the structure and activity of central noradrenergic systems may be major determinants of triiodothyronine distribution patterns and actions in brain. If the noradrenergic system processes both triiodothyronine and norepinephrine and conducts them both to nerve cell groups receiving its terminal arborizations, specific postsynaptic receptors would be available for transduction of both sets of messages. The evidence provides a morphological basis for earlier proposals that triiodothyronine may play a neuromodulatory or neurotransmitter role in the adrenergic nervous system.",,United States,1996,10.1016/0306-4522(96)00186-8,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8884785

The recent surge in use of MDMA and increasing concerns about possible toxic effects of the drug have inspired a great deal of research into the mechanisms by which the drug may affect the central nervous system. This paper reviews studies on the neurochemical, behavioral and neurophysiological effects of MDMA, with emphasis on MDMA effects in regions of the brain that have been implicated in reward. Experiments in awake, behaving laboratory animals have demonstrated that single injections of MDMA increase extracellular levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) in the nucleus accumbens and in several other brain regions that are important for reward. Most of the behavioral and electrophysiological changes that have been reported to date for single doses of MDMA appear to be mediated by this MDMA-induced increase in extracellular DA and 5HT. As an example, MDMA-induced hyperthermia and locomotor hyperactivity in laboratory animals can be blocked by administering drugs that prevent MDMA-induced 5HT release and can be attenuated by administering 5HT receptor antagonists, whereas effects of MDMA on delayed reinforcement tasks appear to be mediated by MDMA-induced increases in extracellular DA. Similarly, the effects of MDMA on neuronal excitability in the nucleus accumbens and in several other brain regions can be prevented by administering drugs that block MDMA-induced 5HT release and can be attenuated by depleting brain DA levels or by administering either DA D1 receptor antagonists or 5HT receptor antagonists. In addition to the acute effects of MDMA, it is now well established that repeated or high-dose administration of MDMA is neurotoxic to a subpopulation of 5HT-containing axons that project to the forebrain in laboratory animals. Recent studies have shown that this neurotoxic effect of MDMA is associated with long-duration changes in both DA and 5HT neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. Whether these long-duration changes in neurotransmission might be related to reports of depression and other psychopathologies by some frequent users of MDMA remains to be determined. Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine has been found to increase extracellular levels of norepinephrine and to alter brain levels of several neuropeptides as well as altering levels of DA and 5HT. Much additional research is required to understand the multiple ways in which this complex drug may alter neurotransmission in the brain, both acutely and in the long term.",,England,1996,10.1016/0301-0082(96)00027-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S. and Review",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8895996

After both treatments, mCPP reduced food intake and NPY levels in the PVN (p < 0.01). NPY mRNA levels were only increased by comparable food restriction (p < 0.05). Acute flesinoxan injection increased food intake and NPY levels in the PVN and ARC (p < 0.01). This suggests that food intake changes induced by mCPP and flesinoxan are associated with altered NPYergic activity. Stimulation of different hypothalamic 5-HT1 receptors may alter NPY levels available for release in the PVN, possibly by altering transport along the ARC-PVN projection. Therefore, inhibition of the ARC-PVN projection may at least partly mediate the hypophagic effects of serotonin.",,United States,1996,10.1016/0196-9781(96)00142-8,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8899812

It inhibits virtually equipotently the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline both in vitro and in vivo, as demonstrated by the antagonism of centrally acting monoamine displacers. It has no effect on dopamine reuptake. In addition, milnacipran has been shown by intracerebral microdialysis to increase the extracellular levels of both serotonin and noradrenaline after acute administration. Milnacipran is devoid of interactions at any known neurotransmitter receptor or ion channel. In particular, and unlike tricyclic antidepressants, it does not act at noradrenergic, muscarinic or histaminergic receptors. Contrary to tricyclic antidepressants, chronic administration of milnacipran does not modify beta-adrenoceptor binding or second messenger function. Milnacipran is active on various animal models of depression such as the forced swimming test in the mouse, learned helplessness in the rat and the olfactory bulbectomized rat model. This pharmacological profile, associated with an excellent bioavailability in man, was predicted to be that required for a powerful and well-tolerated antidepressant.

Exposure of rats to an environment associated with aversive stimuli-foot shock enhanced outflow of dopamine in a similar way as seen during the conditioning session when foot shocks were applied. Diazepam (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased outflow of dopamine and, when given in a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg, decreased enhanced dopamine outflow evoked by conditioned stress. On the other hand, ipsapirone (10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced basal outflow of dopamine. When ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) were given to rats exposed to conditioned stress, the stress-evoked elevation in dopamine outflow was abolished. Ipsapirone in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg was ineffective in the stress paradigm tested. It is concluded that conditioned stress in vivo enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission in the rat prefrontal cortex, this effect being attenuated by diazepam, a classic anxiolytic drug, and by such novel anxiolytics as ipsapirone and buspirone, which operate via serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. Although ipsapirone and buspirone blocked stress-induced enhancement of dopamine outflow, this effect seems to result from their influence on the basal outflow of dopamine.

By employing microdialysis in freely moving rats, the effects of acute risperidone administration on regional brain DA and 5-HT release and metabolism were compared with the corresponding effects of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine as well as amperozide, the selective DA-D2 receptor antagonist raclopride and the selective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor antagonist ritanserin. Risperidone (0.2 or 2.0 mg/kg, SC) was found to increase DA release and metabolism to about the same extent in three major projection areas of the mesotelencephalic dopaminergic system, i.e. the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the medial prefrontal cortex (MPC) and the lateral striatum (STR). In contrast, clozapine and amperozide (both 10.0 mg/kg, SC), as well as raclopride (2.0 mg/kg, SC), were all found differentially to affect DA release and metabolism in the three projections areas. Specifically, clozapine and amperozide enhanced DA release in the MPC to a greater extent than in the NAC or the STR, whereas raclopride instead preferentially increased DA release in the NAC and the STR but not in the MPC. Ritanserin (3.0 mg/kg, SC) did not exert any major effects on DA metabolism in the three areas studied. In contrast to the regionally rather homogenous activation of brain DA systems caused by risperidone, the drug was found to enhance brain 5-HT metabolism preferentially in the MPC, as indicated by the elevated extracellular concentration of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in this region. A similar elevation of the 5-HIAA level in the MPC was observed after amperozide and, to some extent, after clozapine and ritanserin administration. The risperidone-induced (2.0 mg/kg, SC) elevation of 5-HIAA concentrations in the frontal cortex was found to be paralleled by an increased 5-HT release in this brain area. Consequently, our findings demonstrate a pharmacological profile of risperidone, as reflected in brain DA metabolism, in between that of clozapine and the DA-D2 antagonists. The preferential activation of 5-HT release and metabolism in frontal cortical areas might be of particular relevance for the ameliorating effect of risperidone on negative symptoms in schizophrenia, especially when associated with depression.",,Germany,1996,10.1007/BF02245607,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8935802

The dopaminergic system is an excellent example of a control system in which a negative feedback signal is associated with receptor occupancy of a D2-like dopamine autoreceptor. A consequence of the control theory is that autoreceptor occupancy by an agonist results in dopamine levels below the basal, whereas similar stimulation by a dopamine competitive antagonist results in an increase of dopamine to levels above the basal. These consequences of control theory were tested and verified in the rat striatum by infusing graded doses of either the agonist, quinpirole, or the antagonist, sulpiride, into the rat striatum via a microdialysis probe and sampling dopamine and metabolite levels at various times after the start of infusion. Control was maintained even at the very highest doses of these compounds, i.e., striatal dopamine concentration rose in response to the antagonist and fell in response to the agonist. In contrast, administration of each of two high affinity dopamine agonists, 7-OH-DPAT and PPHT showed dose-dependent control only up to certain doses. Above these doses the dopamine concentration actually increased to levels well above basal, an indication of loss of control. These findings suggest that the control of this endogenous ligand does not extend to the very highest levels of autoreceptor occupancy.",,Netherlands,1996,10.1016/0024-3205(96)00525-5,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8937509

Experimentally, deprenyl has also been shown to prevent neuronal cell death in various models through a mechanism that is independent of MAO-B inhibition. We examined the effect of deprenyl on cultured mesencephalic dopamine neurons subjected to daily changes of feeding medium, an experimental paradigm that causes neuronal death associated with activation of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors. Both deprenyl (0.5-50 microM) and the NMDA receptor blocker MK-801 (10 microM) protected dopamine neurons from damage caused by medium changes. The nonselective MAO inhibitor pargyline (0.5-50 microM) was not protective, indicating that protection by deprenyl was not due to MAO inhibition. Deprenyl (50 microM) also protected dopamine neurons from delayed neurotoxicity caused by exposure to NMDA. Because deprenyl had no inhibitory effect on NMDA receptor binding, it is likely that deprenyl protects from events occurring downstream from activation of glutamate receptors.

One study, using BC 197 and BC 264, two highly selective CCK-B agonists, has shown that BC 197 is selective for one subsite, B1, and that BC 264 has the same affinity for the two subsites, B1 and B2. Therefore, the possible involvement of CCK-B subsites in the modulation of endogenous dopamine (DA) release from slices of the anterior part of the nucleus accumbens was investigated with these two agonists in order to associate a functional response with activation of each subsite. The selective B1 agonist BC 197 produced a dose-dependent increase of 35 mM K(+)-stimulated DA release. In contrast, at a low concentration (20 nM), BC 264 inhibited the K(+)-evoked DA release, whereas at a higher concentration (1 microM), it stimulated the DA release. These two opposing effects were suppressed by the CCK-B antagonist PD-134,308, but not by the CCK-A antagonist L-364,718 and were not prevented by tetrodotoxin, a Na(+)-channel blocker. Moreover, BC 264 at 20 nM, in the presence of PD-134,308 at a concentration that would block the B2 subsites (0.1 nM), increased the evoked DA release. All together, these results support further the existence of distinct CCK-B subsites and suggest that, in the anterior nucleus accumbens, their stimulation mediates opposite effects on K(+)-stimulated DA release via a presynaptic mechanism.",,England,1997,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.68010162.x,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8978722

Hippocampal acetylcholine release was evaluated with the microdialysis technique in freely moving rats either after acute administration of isoniazid (an inhibitor of GABA synthesis) or pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (a blocker of the GABAA receptor-associated Cl- channel) or after chronic administration of PTZ. Short-term treatment with PTZ (5-50 mg/kg, i.p.) or isoniazid (150-250 mg/kg, s.c.) increased hippocampal acetylcholine release in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the basal concentration of acetylcholine in the dialysate from the hippocampus of rats chronically treated with PTZ (kindled animals) was significantly reduced relative to that of vehicle-treated rats (2.39 +/- 0.21 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.31 pmol per 20-min sample; p < 0.01). Moreover, the release of acetylcholine was markedly more sensitive to the effect of a challenge injection of PTZ (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) in kindled rats than in naive rats or rats chronically treated with vehicle. Abecarnil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor agonist with marked anticonvulsant activity, was administered together with chronic PTZ to evaluate whether persistent activation of GABAA receptors and suppression of seizures during kindling might affect the sensitivity of septohippocampal cholinergic neurons to a challenge dose of PTZ. Abecarnil (1 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 40 min before each PTZ injection neither antagonized the decrease in basal acetylcholine release (2.26 +/- 0.19 pmol per 20-min sample) nor prevented the development of kindling.

The effects of various agents modifying dopamine transmission were compared on the locomotor response to both drugs. The preferential D2 dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol 37.5-150 micrograms/kg i.p. suppressed the stimulant effect of (+)amphetamine in a dose dependent manner, but not that of modafinil. The D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (7.5-30 micrograms/kg s.c.) reversed the (+)amphetamine but not the modafinil induced hyperactivity. The tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (200 mg/kg) suppressed the hyperactivity induced by 4 mg/kg dexamphetamine but not that induced by 20 mg/kg modafinil. Associating L-DOPA 150 mg/kg and benserazide 37.5 mg/kg with (+)amphetamine 2 mg/kg resulted in stereotyped climbing behavior, that was not observed with modafinil 10-80 mg/kg. The profound akinesia induced by reserpine (4 mg/kg s.c.; 5 h before testing) was reversed by (+)amphetamine 2 mg/kg but not by modafinil 40 mg/kg. Finally, on synaptosomes prepared from mouse striata preloaded with [3H]dopamine, modafinil 10(-5) M did not increase the spontaneous [3H]dopamine release whereas (+)amphetamine, at the same concentration, doubled it. From all these differences between the two drugs, it is concluded that the mechanism underlying the modafinil induced stimulant locomotor effect differs completely from that of (+)amphetamine.",,Netherlands,1995,10.1016/0924-977x(95)00041-m,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-8998404
dd507613-048d-4338-b6a0-4103e7af329e,Effects of acute physical exercise on central serotonergic systems.,Chaouloff F ,Medicine and science in sports and exercise,,"This paper reviews data concerning the effects of acute physical exercise (treadmill running) in trained rats. Works from the 1980's have established that acute running increases brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine: 5-HT) synthesis in two ways. Lipolysis-elicited release of free fatty acids in the blood compartment displaces the binding of the essential amino acid tryptophan to albumin, thereby increasing the concentration of the so-called ""free tryptophan"" portion, and because exercise increases the ratio of circulating free tryptophan to the sum of the concentrations of the amino acids that compete with tryptophan for uptake at the blood-brain barrier level, tryptophan enters markedly in the brain compartment. However, this marked increase in central tryptophan levels increases only to a low extent brain 5-HT synthesis, as assessed by the analysis of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels, thereby suggesting that exercise promotes feedback regulatory mechanisms. Indirect indices of 5-HT functions open the possibility that acute exercise-induced increases in 5-HT biosynthesis are associated with (or lead to) increases in 5-HT release. Lastly, the hypothesis that training and/or acute exercise triggers changes in 5-HT receptors has been examined in several studies; actually, both positive and negative results have been reached. Taken together, all these data support the need for future studies on the functional effects of exercise on 5-HT, including those related to the hypothesis that the positive mood effects of exercise rely (partly or totally) on central serotonergic systems.",,United States,1997,10.1097/00005768-199701000-00009,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9000156

Zacopride decreased the calcium-activated afterhyperpolarization and adaptation, it also elicited a slow membrane depolarization associated with an increase in input resistance. All those effects may have contributed to the zacopride-induced increase in the amplitude of population spikes, evoked in the CA1 cell layer by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway. The later effect of zacopride was concentration-dependent and was antagonized by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist DAU 62805. Repeated (14 days, twice daily), but not single, administration of the antidepressant drugs imipramine, citalopram, fluvoxamine and paroxetine (10 mg/kg) attenuated the effect of zacopride on population spikes. Because inhibitory 5-HT1A and excitatory 5-HT4 receptors are colocalized on pyramidal neurons, and our previous data demonstrated an increase in the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibition after repeated treatment with antidepressants, we conclude that treatment with antidepressant drugs may enhance the inhibitory effect of 5-HT directly, by increasing the 5-HT1A receptor responsiveness, and indirectly, by inducing subsensitivity to the 5-HT4 receptor activation.",,Germany,1997,10.1007/pl00004912,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9007837

Thus, the decreased dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens appears to be involved in the conditioned fear stress.

However, the functional role of these effects of isoflurane on dopamine neurons is uncertain. Dopaminergic mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens and striatum play an important role in the control of locomotor activity, and a change in dopamine turnover depends essentially on a change in impulse flow in the dopamine neurons. In this study, the effects of isoflurane on locomotor activity and on dopamine turnover were investigated in discrete brain regions in mice. METHODS: Mice were placed in individual airtight clear plastic chambers and spontaneously breathed isoflurane in 25% oxygen and 75% nitrogen (fresh gas flow, 4 l/min). Locomotor activity was measured with an Animex activity meter. Animals were decapitated after treatments with or without isoflurane, and the concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites in different brain areas were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: During the 10 min after the cessation of the 20-min exposure to isoflurane, there was a significant increase in locomotor activity in animals breathing 1.5% isoflurane but not 0.7% isoflurane. This increase in locomotor activity produced by 1.5% isoflurane was abolished by a low dose of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), a dopamine receptor antagonist. Regional brain monoamine assays revealed that 1.5% isoflurane significantly increased the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid:dopamine ratio (one indicator of transmitter turnover) in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, but a concentration of 0.7% did not. This significant increase in dopamine turnover in these regions continued during 20 min after the cessation of the administration of 1.5% isoflurane. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that isoflurane-induced hyperlocomotion during emergence may be associated with increased dopamine turnover in the nucleus accumbens and striatum.",,United States,1997,10.1097/00000542-199702000-00022,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9054265

Several lines of evidence suggest that ketamine may impair PFC function in part by interacting with dopamine neurotransmission in this region. This study sought to determine the mechanism by which ketamine may disrupt dopaminergic neurotransmission in, and cognitive functions associated with, the PFC. A thorough dose-response study using microdialysis in conscious rats indicated that low doses of ketamine (10, 20, and 30 mg/kg) increase glutamate outflow in the PFC, suggesting that at these doses ketamine may increase glutamatergic neurotransmission in the PFC at non-NMDA glutamate receptors. An anesthetic dose of ketamine (200 mg/kg) decreased, and an intermediate dose of 50 mg/kg did not affect, glutamate levels. Ketamine, at 30 mg/kg, also increased the release of dopamine in the PFC. This increase was blocked by intra-PFC application of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione CNQX. Furthermore, ketamine-induced activation of dopamine release and impairment of spatial delayed alternation in the rodent, a PFC-sensitive cognitive task, was ameliorated by systemic pretreatment with AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist LY293558. These findings suggest that ketamine may disrupt dopaminergic neurotransmission in the PFC as well as cognitive functions associated with this region, in part, by increasing the release of glutamate, thereby stimulating postsynaptic non-NMDA glutamate receptors.",,United States,1997,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-08-02921.1997,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S. and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9092613

PPI is an operational measure of gating processes which normally lead to a diminished ASR when a startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse. PPI is impaired in schizophrenics and, therefore, experimentally induced PPI deficits in rats can be regarded as a model for gating deficits in schizophrenia. Local administration of 7-chlorokynurenate (7-CLKYN), an antagonist of the strychnine-insensitive glycine site of the NMDA receptor, into the nucleus accumbens reduced PPI. This sensorimotor gating deficit was antagonized by systemic pretreatment of the rats with the glycine site agonist D-cycloserine, indicating that the effect of 7-CLKYN was due to a blockade of the NMDA receptor associated glycine binding site. A similar deficit in PPI was observed after intra-accumbal administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5. PPI was normal after injecting these drugs into the anterodorsal striatum. The hypothesis that the PPI deficit is accompanied by a change in dopamine release was tested by a neurochemical analysis of the effects of local injection of 7-CLKYN. Microdialysis data showed no increase of accumbal and striatal dopamine release after blockade of the glycine site with 7-CLKYN.

A novel brain imaging method provides an indirect measure of in vivo synaptic dopamine concentration by quantifying the change in dopamine receptor radiotracer binding produced by agents that alter dopamine release but do not themselves bind to dopamine receptors. The purpose of this investigation is (i) to determine the sensitivity (i.e., amount of dopamine reflected in radiotracer binding changes) of this method by examining the relationship between amphetamine-induced changes in simultaneously derived striatal extracellular dopamine levels with in vivo microdialysis and striatal binding levels with the dopamine D2/D3 positron-emission tomography radioligand [11C]raclopride in nonhuman primates, and (ii) to test the hypothesis of elevated amphetamine-induced synaptic dopamine levels in schizophrenia.

In addition, the ratio of percent mean dopamine increase to percent mean striatal binding reduction for amphetamine (0.2 mg/kg) was 44:1, demonstrating that relatively small binding changes reflect large changes in dopamine outflow.

Glucocorticoids act via intracellular glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, whereas 5-hydroxytryptamine binds to a family of transmembrane sites; both cross- and auto-regulation have been proposed. To determine the roles of 5-hydroxytryptamine and corticosterone in the short-term control of hippocampal receptor gene expression, we used 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (20 mg/kg), which causes acute release of both 5-hydroxytryptamine and corticosterone. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine increased mineralocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression throughout the hippocampus after 16 h. In rats with fixed glucocorticoid levels (adrenalectomy plus corticosterone pellets) this effect was lost in CA1-4, suggesting corticosterone-mediation, but maintained in the dentate gyrus, indicating 5-hydroxytryptamine involvement. In contrast, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine decreased glucocorticoid receptor messenger RNA expression in the dentate gyrus and CA1 within 4 h, but only in adrenal-intact rats, suggesting corticosterone control. 5-Hydroxytryptamine1A receptor messenger RNA expression was decreased in CA1 in both groups of rats, but increased in the dentate gyrus only in corticosterone-fixed rats, suggesting 5-hydroxytryptamine differentially regulates expression of this gene within hippocampal subfields. 5-hydroxytryptamine2C receptor messenger RNA was decreased in ventral CA1 only in adrenal-intact rats, suggesting a corticosterone effect, and decreased in the subiculum in both groups, indicating 5-hydroxytryptamine mediation. These results show the complexity and intricate subregional-specificity of 5-hydroxytryptamine and corticosterone interactions upon hippocampal corticosteroid and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor gene expression. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-induced alterations in hippocampal receptor gene expression may play a role in the mood and behavioural changes associated with this drug of abuse.",,United States,1997,10.1016/s0306-4522(96)00497-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9135093

The second-generation antidepressants, the selective-serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), mitigate some of the side effects associated with the TCAs by selectively inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT. Venlafaxine is a new antidepressant that blocks reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. It, like the SSRIs, has a relatively benign side-effect profile. In addition, it may exert a rapid onset of action, and it appears to be particularly effective in moderate-to-severe depression and in patients who have treatment-refractory depression.",,United States,1996,10.1002/(SICI)1522-7162(1996)4:2<48::AID-DEPR2>3.0.CO;2-B,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9160640

Because fetal 5-HT is an essential trophic factor, this laboratory previously investigated the hypotheses that the early ethanol-associated 5-HT deficit contributed to subsequent development abnormalities in the serotonergic system and that the effects of the fetal 5-HT deficit could be prevented by maternal treatment with buspirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. The present report determined the effects of maternal treatment with buspirone on two other neurotransmitter systems in the developing offspring of ethanol-fed dams: dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine reuptake sites and D1 receptors in postnatal day 19 offspring of control and ethanol-fed dams, that received daily injections of saline or 4.5 mg/kg buspirone. These investigations found that in utero ethanol exposure significantly decreased norepinephrine reuptake sites in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus and anteroventral thalamic nucleus. There was also an ethanol effect in the dorsal raphe. D1 receptors were moderately increased (5-10% increase) in the striatum, and DA reuptake sites were unchanged in PN19 ethanol-exposed offspring. No other significant ethanol-related effects were noted. Maternal buspirone treatment did not adversely affect the concentration of DA reuptake sites or D1 receptors in control rats. Thus, whereas buspirone exerts protective effects on the developing 5-HT system of ethanol-exposed rats, it does not appear to damage the development of the DA system. Maternal buspirone produced only one significant abnormality in control offspring; it resulted in significant reduction of norepinephrine reuptake sites in the DR.",,England,1997,10.1111/j.1530-0277.1997.tb03790.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9161605

Interference with the central functions of histamine have not been adequately addressed, despite the identification of histamine as a central neurotransmitter and neuromodulator. A synthesis of data support antagonism of H1-receptors as critical to the CNS toxicity of these drugs. The histaminergic neuronal system (HNS) is involved in a variety of global brain functions. Inherent or induced alterations in the HNS are associated with behavioral disorders. Clinical and experimental evidence support a role for the HNS in seizure protection and a relationship exits between histamine regulated systems and seizures. Histamine has important neuromodulatory influences on the central electrophysiology which underlies normal thalamocortical function. H1-antagonists block the H1-receptor-mediated reduction of a background-leakage K+ current (IKL) in central neurons. Secondary alterations in other ionic currents and alterations in synaptic responses to glutamate and GABA are produced. The non-H1 receptor-mediated effects of histamine persist in the presence of these drugs, contributing to imbalances in central electrophysiology. H1-antagonist-induced changes are similar to the electrical disturbances thought to underly epileptic seizures and may adequately explain their hallucinogenic activity. These data form the basis for this review and must be considered as a major mechanism for the CNS toxicity of the first-generation H1-antagonists.",,England,1997,10.1016/s0301-0082(97)00011-7,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9185237

Dopamine plays a critical role in motivation, including reward associated with consumption of palatable tastes. The present studies assessed the role of dopamine in real and sham drinking of NaCl solutions after Na depletion with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg). Dopamine (D2) receptor antagonists were evaluated (Haloperidol [0.1 mg/kg] and raclopride [0.2 mg/kg]), for their effects on sham and real drinking of 0.3 M NaCl. Sham drinking was markedly reduced by both antagonists whereas real drinking was unaffected. These effects did not appear to be due to malaise or suppression of motor behavior because drug-treated animals were able to increase ingestion substantially when offered less concentrated NaCl (0.1 M).

To further study the influence of risperidone on central 5-HT systems, we compared its effects on dialysate 5-HT in the FC, as assessed by microdialysis, with those obtained with other antipsychotic drugs, i.e., clozapine, haloperidol, and amperozide, as well as with the selective alpha 2- or 5-HT2A receptor antagonists idazoxan or MDL 100,907, respectively. The underlying mechanism for risperidone's effect on 5-HT output in the FC was also investigated using single-cell recording in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Administration of risperidone (0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg/kg, SC) dose-dependently increased 5-HT levels in the FC. This stimulatory action was mimicked by amperozide (10 mg/kg, SC) and, to some extent, by idazoxan (0.25 mg/kg, SC). In contrast, clozapine (10 mg/kg, SC), haloperidol (2.0 mg/kg, SC), and MDL 100,907 (1.0 mg/kg, SC) exerted only minor effects on 5-HT output in brain. Local administration of risperidone or idazoxan (1.0-1000 mumol/L) in the FC dose-dependently increased dialysate levels of 5-HT in this region. On the other hand, risperidone 25-800 micrograms/kg, IV) dose-dependently decreased the firing rate of 5-HT cells in the DRN, an effect that was largely antagonized by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 (5.0 micrograms/kg, IV). These results indicate that the risperidone-increased 5-HT output in the FC may be related to its alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonistic action, a property shared with both amperozide and idazoxan, and that this action probably is executed at the nerve terminal level. The inhibition of 5-HT cell firing by risperidone is probably secondary to increased 5-HT availability, e.g., in the DRN, since it could be antagonized by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. The enhanced 5-HT output in the FC by risperidone may be of particular relevance for the treatment of schizophrenia when associated with depression and in schizoaffective disorder.",,England,1997,10.1016/S0893-133X(97)00002-X,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9194049

In vitro dissociation of 18F-fallypride with dopamine in rat striatal homogenates exhibited a dissociation rate, k(off), of 1.76 x 10(-2) min(-1) while the association rate constant, k(on), was found to be 5.30 x 10(8) M(-1) min(-1). This resulted in a dissociation constant, K(D) of 33 pM for 18F-fallypride. For in vivo studies, we investigated the effects of reserpine and d-amphetamine treatment on 18F-fallypride in an attempt to study competition of endogenous dopamine with the radioligand at the receptor sites in rats and monkeys. PET experiments with 18F-fallypride in two male rhesus monkeys were carried out in a PETT VI scanner. In control experiments, rapid specific uptake of 18F-fallypride in the striata was observed (0.05-0.06% injected dose (ID)/g) while nonspecifically bound tracer cleared from other parts of the brain. Striata/cerebellum ratios for 18F-fallypride were approximately 8 at 80 min postinjection, respectively. The monkeys received various doses (0.25 to 1.50 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine (AMPH) pre- and postinjection of the radioligand. There was a decrease of specifically bound 18F-fallypride as well as evidence of an enhanced clearance of specifically bound 18F-fallypride after administering AMPH in the two monkeys. The dissociation rates, k(off), of 18F-fallypride without AMPH was <10(-4) min(-1) but after 25 min preadministration of AMPH (1 mg/kg), it was 4.1 x 10(-3) min(-1) and after 17, 45 and 90 min postadministration of AMPH (1 mg/kg) it was 3.6 x 10(-3) to 4.0 x 10(-3) min(-1). Lower doses of AMPH (0.25 mg/kg) had a reduced effect on the binding of 18F-fallypride. No effect was seen until about 30 minutes after the injection of AMPH. Studies with various doses indicated that 18F-fallypride has a maximum response at doses of 0.75-1.50 mg/kg, with an approximately 16%/hour reduction in binding.

In the present study we examined the effects of a dopamine receptor agonist and some antagonists on latent learning and memory deficits associated with a concussive traumatic brain injury in mice. Anaesthetized animals were subjected to mild traumatic brain injury by dropping a weight onto the head, and a single-dose injection of apomorphine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) was made i.p. 15 min after the trauma. One week later, a water-finding task consisting of an acquisition trial, a retention test and a retest was employed to assess learning and memory functions. Mice that had received a traumatic brain injury were impaired in task performance, with prolonged latencies for finding and drinking in the retention test and retest. Administration of haloperidol but not of apomorphine significantly shortened the prolonged latency in both of the tests, indicating that antagonism of dopamine receptors is beneficial for the recovery of post traumatic memory deficits. In order to evaluate which receptor subtype plays the major role in this model, we examined the effects of SCH-23390 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), a D1 receptor antagonist, and sulpiride (3.0-30 mg/kg), a D2 receptor antagonist, in the same experimental paradigm. The results showed that administration of sulpiride but not of SCH-23390 significantly improved the deficits in task performance, indicating that D2 receptors are the major site of action. However, combined treatment with SCH-23390 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and sulpiride (3.0 mg/kg) at doses that had no effect when the antagonists were given alone exerted a significant additive effect in improving these deficits, indicating that interaction between D1 and D2 receptors is involved in these processes.

Adult human liver microsomes catalyze the NADPH-dependent N-oxygenation of phenethylamine to the corresponding trans-oxime through the intermediacy of phenethyl hydroxylamine. In addition to trans-oxime formation, phenethyl hydroxylamine is retroreduced to phenethylamine in the presence of human or porcine liver microsomes. Studies on the biochemical mechanism of N-oxygenation suggested that trans-oxime formation was dependent on the human FMO (form 3) and that retroreduction was stimulated by superoxide and dependent on a cytochrome P-450 system. These conclusions are based on studies examining the effects of incubation conditions on phenethylamine N-oxygenation and the effect of reactive oxygen species on phenethyl hydroxylamine retroreduction, respectively. The pharmacological activity of synthetic phenethyl hydroxylamine and phenethyl oxime with a number of biogenic amine receptors and transporters was examined in vitro. In all cases examined, the affinity of phenethyl hydroxylamine and the corresponding oxime for a biogenic transporter or receptors was very poor.

Indeed, it is generally believed that this structure subserves motivated behaviors, such as feeding, drinking, sexual behavior, and exploratory locomotion, which are elicited by natural rewards or incentive stimuli. A basic rule of positive reinforcement is that motor responses will increase in magnitude and vigor if followed by a rewarding event. It is likely, therefore, that the nucleus accumbens may serve as a substrate for reinforcement learning. However, there is surprisingly little information concerning the neural mechanisms by which appetitive responses are learned. In the present study, we report that treatment of the nucleus accumbens core with the selective competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5; 5 nmol/0.5 microl bilaterally) impairs response-reinforcement learning in the acquisition of a simple lever-press task to obtain food. Once the rats learned the task, AP-5 had no effect, demonstrating the requirement of NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity in the early stages of learning. Infusion of AP-5 into the accumbens shell produced a much smaller impairment of learning. Additional experiments showed that AP-5 core-treated rats had normal feeding and locomotor responses and were capable of acquiring stimulus-reward associations. We hypothesize that stimulation of NMDA receptors within the accumbens core is a key process through which motor responses become established in response to reinforcing stimuli. Further, this mechanism, may also play a critical role in the motivational and addictive properties of drugs of abuse.",,United States,1997,10.1073/pnas.94.22.12174,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9342382

The regions examined include those containing the cell bodies and projections of serotonergic neurons. These experiments demonstrated the sensitivity of the serotonergic system of male Fischer 344 rats to both aging and chronic ethanol consumption. In control rats, aging was associated with a decline in the concentration of 5-HT2A receptors in the nucleus accumbens and four cortical regions: frontal, parietal, piriform, and cingulate cortex. 5-HT2A receptors were also reduced in the frontal, parietal, and cingulate cortex of aged ethanol-fed rats. In contrast, 5-HT reuptake sites were increased in older rats in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and CA3 region of the hippocampus. If comparable changes in 5-HT2A receptors and 5-HT reuptake sites occur in elderly humans, they may contribute to ethanol consumption, and lead to cognitive and other age-related problems.

An alternative hypothesis is that reward is mediated by a different system, but that a steady activation of post-synaptic receptors by noradrenaline is necessary for normal behavior. The synthesis of noradrenaline was inhibited by disulfiran, and when lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation in the rat had ceased, alpha-adrenergic stimulants were injected intraventricularly (IC) or intraperitoneally (IP). The directly acting receptor stimulants oxymetazoline (0.9-250 mug IC), naphazoline (20-250 mug IC), and clonidine (0.75-3 mug IC, 0.037-3 mg/kg IP) did not restore self-stimulation, but the indirectly acting stimulants amphetamine (2 mg/kg IP), methylphenidate (3 mg/kg IP) and phenylephrine (15 mug IC) did not restore self-stimulation. In Experiments 2 and 3, in which either the functional noradrenaline pool was depleted with disulfiram and amphetamine, or the reserve noradrenaline pool was depleted with reserpine, the action of phenylephrine in restoring self-stimulation was shown to be indirect, probably by mobilizing a reserve pool of noradrenaline. Because only indirectly acting noradrenergic stimulants which facilitate the release of noradrenaline restores self-stimulation, it is concluded that noradrenaline must be released contingent on every response for self-stimulation to occur. Whether this released noradrenaline mediates the reward or has some other function associated with bar-pressing behavior remains to be shown.",,United States,1976,10.1016/0091-3057(76)90050-2,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-935209

In the present study, superfusion and electrical field stimulation were applied to a series of rat hippocampal brain slices in order to investigate the regulation of [3H]-NE release. NE release had been previously determined to be decreased by TNF alpha in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect which was potentiated by the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist idazoxan. Presently, we demonstrate that similar to alpha 2-adrenergic activation, TNF alpha regulation of NE release in a region of the brain rich in noradrenergic nerve terminals, is dependent upon the frequency of electrical stimulation applied to the hippocampal slice. Furthermore, immunoperoxidase staining has verified our previous findings of constitutive TNF alpha protein in the rat brain. Staining for TNF alpha appears to be largely localized to neurons and neuronal processes, further substantiating the proposal that TNF alpha is either synthesized de novo or is accumulated in and released by neurons. After administration of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine, tissue sections obtained from the rat hippocampus and locus coeruleus are devoid of neuronal-associated TNF alpha immunoreactivity. TNF alpha localization in neurons and its modification of NE release comparable to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor activation, explains a functional role for the cytokine as a neuromodulator in the CNS.",,Netherlands,1997,10.1016/s0165-5728(97)00107-0,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9357451

Herein, we examined whether blockade of alpha2-adrenergic receptors modified the influence of monoamine reuptake inhibitors on FCX levels of serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NAD), and dopamine (DA). The selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist S 18616 (0.16 mg/kg, s.c.) suppressed extracellular levels of NAD, DA, and 5-HT (by 100, 51, and 63%, respectively) in single dialysates of FCX of freely moving rats. In contrast, the selective alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists atipamezole (0.16 mg/kg, s.c.) and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP; 2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) increased levels of NAD (by 180 and 185%, respectively) and DA (by 130 and 90%, respectively), without affecting 5-HT levels. Duloxetine (5.0 mg/kg, s.c.), a mixed inhibitor of 5-HT and NAD reuptake, and fluoxetine (10.0 mg/kg, s.c.), a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, both increased levels of 5-HT (by 150 and 120%, respectively), NAD (by 400 and 100%, respectively), and DA (by 115 and 55%, respectively). Atipamezole (0.16 mg/kg, s.c.) markedly potentiated the influence of duloxetine and fluoxetine on levels of 5-HT (by 250 and 330%, respectively), NAD (by 1,030 and 215%, respectively), and DA (by 370 and 170%, respectively). 1-PP similarly potentiated the influence of duloxetine on 5-HT, NAD, and DA levels (by 290, 1,320, and 600%, respectively). These data demonstrate that alpha2-adrenergic receptors tonically inhibit NAD and DA and phasically inhibit 5-HT release in the FCX and that blockade of alpha2-adrenergic receptors strikingly potentiates the increase in FCX levels of 5-HT, NAD, and DA elicited by reuptake inhibitors.

Reperfusion after 2 h of renal ischaemia was associated with local overflow of noradrenaline (NA) but not of NPY-like immunoreactivity (-LI). Renal sympathetic nerve stimulation 10 min into reperfusion evoked markedly reduced vasoconstrictor effects and significantly less overflow of NA (reduced by 70% from the pre-ischaemic conditions), whereas NPY-LI overflow was unaltered. Renal vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous peptide YY (PYY), phenylephrine and angiotensin II were strongly attenuated after this ischaemic period, while vasoconstriction to alpha, beta-methylene ATP was maintained to a larger extent. The renal vascular responses and NA overflow had become partially normalized within a 2 h recovery period. In contrast, the renal vasoconstrictor response and the overflow of NPY-LI upon sympathetic nerve stimulation were enhanced after 15 min of renal ischaemia. In parallel, the PYY-evoked renal vasoconstriction was selectively and markedly prolonged after the 15 min of ischaemia. In the presence of the NPYY1 receptor antagonist BIBP 3226, the augmented vascular response to nerve stimulation was significantly attenuated. We conclude that reperfusion after 2 h of renal ischaemia is associated with local overflow of NA, whereas the sympathetic nerve-evoked release of NA and the reactivity of the renal vasculature to vasoconstrictor stimuli are reversibly reduced. Furthermore, possibly due to an impaired local degradation, the role of neurogenically released NPY in renal sympathetic vasoconstriction is enhanced after short-term (15 min) ischaemia compared with control conditions.",,England,1997,10.1046/j.1365-201X.1997.00238.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9401585

FC regions may also be important in chronic negative symptoms, as hypofrontality has been associated with these schizophrenic features. 4. The author examined effects of a behaviorally-active dose of the D3 agonist, 7OH, on 5-HT metabolism in FC, and the ability of a low-dose neuroleptic treatment to antagonize this biochemical effect. 5. Acute administration of 7OH induced a selective decrease of 5-HT turnover in the FC without affecting metabolism of this transmitter in more subcortical DA regions. 6. Hal, which has previously been demonstrated to antagonize electrophysiologic, biochemical and behavioral effects of 7OH, was without effect on agonist-induced decreases in 5-HT turnover. 7.

RS-8359 shows little affinity for the common central nervous system receptors and little anticholinergic effect. These characteristics suggest a relatively benign adverse event profile, which may be particularly advantageous in the elderly and may generally contribute to patient acceptance and compliance.

Among these mechanisms, those related to central serotonergic systems (e.g., hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors, cortical 5-HT2A receptors) have been particularly underlined. Nonetheless, how (i) the neuroendocrine and behavioural effects of social stress are affected by the genetic status of the animal, and (ii) this status affects the relationships between central serotonergic systems and adaptive processes has not been studied so far. The present study has thus analysed the effects of repeated defeat (once a day for seven days) by Long-Evans resident rats upon the psychoneuroendocrine profile of Lewis rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats previously characterized for their contrasting social and anxiety-related behaviours. Repeated defeat decreased in a time-dependent manner, body weight growth and food intake in both strains, these decreases being, however, more severe and longer lasting in Lewis rats. This strain-dependent difference could not be accounted for by differences in physical contacts with the resident rats as the number of attacks and their latency throughout the stress period were similar between spontaneously hypertensive and Lewis rats. When exposed to an elevated plus-maze test of anxiety, the unstressed Lewis rats entered less the open arms than their spontaneously hypertensive counterparts, thus confirming that Lewis rats are more anxious than spontaneously hypertensive rats. This difference was amplified by stress as the latter increased anxiety-related behaviours in Lewis rats only. These strain- and stress-related differences were associated with differences in locomotor activity, this being increased in unstressed Lewis compared with spontaneously hypertensive rats; moreover, stress triggered hypolocomotion in the former but not the latter strain. Lastly, in the forced swimming test. Lewis rats spent more time immobile than spontaneously hypertensive rats with stress increasing immobility in a strain-independent manner. Beside the aforementioned metabolic changes, the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis was slightly stimulated in a strain-independent manner by the stressor, as assessed by increased corticosterone levels and adrenal weights, and decreased thymus weights. In Lewis, but not in spontaneously hypertensive rats, midbrain serotonin metabolism was increased by stress, a difference associated with an increased Bmax value of cortical [3H]ketanserin binding at 5-HT2A receptors. On the other hand, the Bmax value of hippocampal [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin binding at 5-HT1A receptors was decreased by stress, this reduction being amplified in spontaneously hypertensive compared with Lewis rats. This study shows that the psychoneuroendocrine responses to social stress may have a genetic origin, and that the use of socially stressed Lewis and spontaneously hypertensive rats may provide an important paradigm to study adaptive processes. However, whether the aforementioned strain-dependent differences in central serotonergic systems (partly or totally) underlie the distinct profiles of emotivity measured in spontaneously hypertensive and Lewis rats, is discussed in the context of the relationships between serotonergic systems and behavioural responses to novel environments.",,United States,1998,10.1016/s0306-4522(97)00282-0,Comparative Study and Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9483511

We focused on the 5-HT2 receptor, which is engaged in 5-HT induced small arteriolar relaxation in cats, as well as on the 5-HT1D/1B receptor, the binding site of the potent antimigraine drug sumatriptan. In male barbiturate anaesthetized Wistar rats (n=25) CSDs were elicited by brain topical application of 1 M KCl, and the DC-potential and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF, by Laser Doppler flowmetry) were measured over the same hemisphere through dura and thinned bone, respectively. Intravenous application of 8 mg/kg of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ritanserin (group I; n=8) significantly reduced the hyperperfusion amplitude during CSD by approximately 44% (p<0.05, from 342+/-124 to 194+/-97%, baseline before CSD=100%), and prolonged its duration by approx. 30%.

Microdialysis was utilized in freely moving rats implanted with probes in the VTA and NAC. Dialysates from the NAC were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography for DA and its metabolites. The VTA was perfused with the AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (0.3 or 1 mM) or vehicle. Forty min after onset of CNQX or vehicle perfusion of the VTA, MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously. Subsequently, typical MK-801 induced behaviors were also assessed in the same animals by direct observation. MK-801 induced hyperlocomotion was associated with a 50% increase of DA levels in NAC dialysates. Both the MK-801 evoked hyperlocomotion and DA release in the NAC was antagonized by CNQX perfusion of the VTA in a concentration-dependent manner. None of the other rated MK-801 evoked behaviors, e.g. head weaving or sniffing, were affected by CNQX perfusion of the VTA. By itself the CNQX or vehicle perfusion of the VTA alone did not affect DA levels in NAC or any of the rated behaviors. These results indicate that MK-801 induced hyperlocomotion and DA release in the NAC are largely elicited within the VTA via activation of non-NMDA EAA receptors, tentatively caused by increased EAA release. Thus, the locomotor stimulation induced by psychotomimetic NMDA receptor antagonists may not only reflect impaired NMDA receptor function, but also enhanced AMPA and/or kainate receptor activation in brain, e.g., in the VTA.

Administration of abecarnil (0.1 mg/kg, IP) 40 min before food presentation prevented the increase in ACh output in both brain regions during the anticipatory phase. In contrast, although abecarnil reduced the ACh content achieved during the consummatory phase, it did not prevent the increase in ACh release in the prefrontal cortex or hippocampus induced by food intake. Finally, the binding of [35S]TPBS to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, or septum of rats killed 20 min before food presentation was significantly higher than the values for animals killed 2 h after food presentation.

This study was designed to examine the effects of acute and chronic METH exposure on uptake and release of [3H]dopamine (DA) in cultured midbrain dopamine neurons to determine if persistent neuronal adaptations ensue. In addition, we have assessed DA D2 receptor function to determine if chronic METH alters this receptor. Fetal midbrain cultures were exposed to METH (1, 10 microM) for 5 days and dopaminergic function examined 1 or 7 days after drug removal. The ability of METH to release [3H]DA was compared to other releasing agents as well as several potent uptake inhibitors. Chronic exposure to a release-promoting concentration of METH resulted in either no change or a reduction in [3H]DA release upon subsequent METH challenge. Pretreatment with METH was also found to cause a decrease in the Bmax for [3H]raclopride binding, suggesting that persistently elevated DA levels cause a downregulation of DA D2 receptors. Examination of transporter kinetics utilizing initial velocity of uptake revealed that METH treatment caused a significant decrease in affinity (K(m)) for the substrate (DA), while not altering the maximal velocity of uptake (Vmax). Binding studies with [125I]RTI-55 revealed that there was no alteration in either the Bmax or Kd for this ligand, suggesting that the changes induced by METH treatment are due to alterations in K(m) and not in the number of DA transport sites. The results from these studies indicate that METH treatment produces a modification in transporter function which may be associated with both the altered uptake and release of [3H]DA. These changes have broad implications for the regulation of transporter activity not only because of the relevance to pre-synaptic mechanisms controlling neurotransmission, but also to the importance of the neuronal adaptation that occurs in response to chronic METH exposure.",,Netherlands,1998,10.1016/s0006-8993(97)01281-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9519266

The compound inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity in mice, an effect which was antagonized by the dopamine D3 receptor antagonist 5,6-dimethoxy-2-(di-u-propylamino) indan (U99194A). Moreover, cis-8-OH-PBZI inhibited conditioned avoidance responding in rats, a preclinical test indicative of antipsychotic efficacy, at doses which did not induce catalepsy. Doses of cis-8-OH-PBZI (6 and 12 mg/kg) that inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity in rats did not affect interstitial levels of dopamine and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens or dorsolateral striatum. In contrast to the effect of the dopamine receptor agonist (+/-)-2-dipropylamino-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphythalene (7-OH-DPAT), cis-8-OH-PBZI did not induce locomotor activity in reserpinized mice. In conclusion, cis-8-OH-PBZI exhibits a pharmacological profile that suggests it has antipsychotic activity but lacks the motoric side effects often associated with antipsychotic medication. The data suggest a mechanism requiring the activation of postsynaptic dopamine D3 receptors and support the hypothesis that these receptors mediate inhibitory behavioral effects.",,Netherlands,1998,10.1016/s0014-2999(97)01494-5,Journal Article,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9548380

Biochemical studies demonstrate that mild stress preferentially increases dopamine turnover in the PFC. Our study examined the effects of acute, mild stress exposure on higher cognitive function in monkeys and the role of dopaminergic mechanisms in the stress response. METHODS: The effects of loud (105-dB) noise stress were examined on a spatial working memory task (delayed response) dependent on the PFC, and on a reference memory task with similar motor and motivational demands (visual pattern discrimination) dependent on the inferior temporal cortex. The role of dopamine mechanisms was tested by challenging the stress response with agents that decrease dopamine receptor stimulation. RESULTS: Exposure to noise stress significantly impaired delayed-response performance. Stress did not impair performance on ""0-second"" delay control trials and did not alter visual pattern discrimination performance, which is consistent with impaired PFC cognitive function rather than nonspecific changes in performance. Stress-induced deficits in delayed-response performance were ameliorated by pretreatment with drugs that block dopamine receptors (haloperidol, SCH 23390) or reduce stress-induced PFC dopamine turnover in rodents (clonidine, naloxone hydrochloride). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that stress impairs PFC cognitive function through a hyperdopaminergic mechanism. Stress may take the PFC ""off-line"" to allow more habitual responses mediated by posterior cortical and subcortical structures to regulate behavior. This mechanism may have survival value, but may often be maladaptive in human society, contributing to the vulnerability of the PFC in many neuropsychiatric disorders.",,United States,1998,10.1001/archpsyc.55.4.362,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9554432

Studies were performed in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated 2-3 days old piglets. Hypoxic insult was induced by decreasing the oxygen fraction in inspired gas (FiO2) from 22 to 7% for 1 h, followed by 1 h reoxygenation at 22%. Cortical oxygen pressure was measured optically by oxygen dependent quenching of phosphorescence, and extracellular striatal dopamine was measured using in vivo microdialysis. The microdialysis probes were perfused with Ringer solution +/- 50 microM (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) or 50 microM 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX). One hour of hypoxia decreased the cortical oxygen pressure from 46 +/- 3 Torr to 10 +/- 1.8 Torr. In striatum perfused with Ringer, statistically significant increase in extracellular dopamine, to 1050 +/- 310% of control, was observed after 20 min of hypoxia. By 40 min of hypoxia the extracellular level of dopamine increased to 4730 +/- 900% of control; by the end of the hypoxic period the values increased to 18,451 +/- 1670% of control. The presence of MK-801 in the perfusate significantly decreased the levels of extracellular dopamine during hypoxia. At 20, 40 and 60 min of hypoxia extracellular level of dopamine increased to 278 +/- 94% of control, 1530 +/- 339% of control and 14,709 +/- 1095 of control, respectively. The presence of NBQX caused a statistically significant decrease, by about 30%, in the extracellular dopamine compared to control, only at the end of the hypoxic period. It can be concluded that in striatum of newborn piglets, the excitatory NMDA receptors but not the non-NMDA receptors may be modulating the changes in extracellular levels of dopamine. The NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, may exert part of its reported neuroprotective effect to hypoxic stress in striatum by decreasing the levels of extracellular dopamine.",,England,1998,10.1016/s0197-0186(97)00091-0,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9587922

In animals, lesions of limbic-cortical neurons cause decreases in glutamatergic input to the nucleus accumbens and are also associated with decreases in presynaptic dopamine release, increases in the density of D2-like dopamine receptors, and insensitivity to the actions of dopamine antagonists such as haloperidol.

Application of either glutamate or levodopa as a dopamine precursor increased background and evoked impulse activity in many of sensorimotor cortex neurons. It occurred occasionally that an increased impulse activity of cortical neurons produced by joint application of glutamate and levodopa could be much more intense than that produced by one of these substances. Amphetamine acted on cortical neurons in a similar way as levodopa. Haloperidol, a non-selective blocker of dopamine1 and dopamine2 receptors, increased or did not change background and evoked impulse activity in some cortical neurons. In contrast to application of glutamate alone, simultaneous application of glutamate and haloperidol to the neocortex depressed neuronal responses connected with conditioned movement. Thus, glutamate cannot exert its potentiating effect on evoked neuronal activity due to the depressing action of haloperidol. This means that glutamate potentiation is realized to a great extent through molecular mechanisms common for glutamate and dopamine, possibly through G-proteins which are common for glutamate metabotropic and dopamine receptors.",,United States,1998,10.1016/s0306-4522(97)00643-x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9622235

To determine whether an amino acid mutation can confer dramatic alterations in the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A (5-HT2A) receptor, we mutated amino acid 322 to lysine (C322K), glutamate (C322E) or arginine (C322R). Transient expression of the mutant receptors revealed properties associated with constitutive activity. Radioligand binding studies revealed an increase in 5-HT affinity from 293 nM (native) to 86 nM (C322E), 25 nM (C322K) and 11 nM (C322R). 5-HT potency for stimulation of inositol phosphate production increased from 152 nM (native) to 61 nM (C322E) and 25 nM (C322K). Basal inositol phosphate levels in COS-7 cells expressing C322K and C322E mutant receptors were 8-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, than cells expressing native 5-HT2A receptors. Basal levels of inositol phosphate stimulated by C322K receptors represented 48% of total inositol phosphate production stimulated by native receptors in the presence of 10 microM 5-HT. Antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine, clozapine, haloperidol, loxapine and risperidone) displayed inverse agonist activity by inhibiting C322K constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis. These data indicate that amino acid 322 in the 5-HT2A receptor plays an important role in maintaining the inactive conformation and provide further evidence that amino acid mutations can produce profound alterations in G protein-coupled receptor activity.",,United States,1998,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9655845

The locomotor-activating effects of VH stimulation have been hypothesized to be mediated via hippocampal output to cortical and subcortical dopamine (DA) systems. This study examined whether increased locomotor activity produced by VH stimulation was blocked by pretreatment with a DA receptor antagonist, and whether DA metabolism in subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens, caudate-putamen, and prefrontal cortex was elevated by VH stimulation. Stimulation of the VH (defined as the ventral CA1 and its borders, ventral subiculum, and entorhinal cortex) with the cholinergic agonist carbachol was found to elevate locomotor activity, while pretreatment with the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol blocked this effect. Stimulation of the VH did not alter DA metabolism (i.e., ratio of the DA metabolites DOPAC or HVA/DA) in any of the brain regions studied. These results indicate that the increased locomotor activity elicited by VH stimulation is not associated with dramatic increases in DA metabolism, but that it does require tonic activation of D2 receptors.",,United States,1998,10.1016/s0091-3057(98)00053-7,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9678662

The activation of dopamine release and utilization in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens are associated with profound cognitive impairment and hyperlocomotion, respectively. This dopaminergic activation by phencyclidine is not mediated by direct effects on the cell body regions of the dopamine neurons; however, phencyclidine augments dopamine release locally in the terminal fields. In the present study, the possible involvement of the prefrontal cortex in mediating activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system by phencyclidine was examined. Ibotenic acid lesions of the prefrontal cortex attenuated the biochemical activation of the mesolimbic dopamine neurons by PCP, and prefrontal lesions sharply blunted phencyclidine-, but not amphetamine- or novelty-, induced hyperlocomotion. In addition, injection of phencyclidine directly into the prefrontal cortex increased dopamine utilization in the nucleus accumbens and induced hyperlocomotion. In summary, these studies show that phencyclidine activates the mesolimbic pathway through a mechanism in the prefrontal cortex, possibly by disinhibiting the cortical circuit and activating corticofugal glutamatergic release in the ventral tegmental area.",,Germany,1998,10.1007/s002130050649,"Comparative Study and Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9694531

The effects of risperidone on brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuronal activity were investigated using microdialysis in the frontal cortex (FC) or the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) as well as single cell recording in the DRN. 2. Systemic administration of risperidone (0.6 and 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) dose-dependently increased 5-HT output in both the FC and the DRN. 3. Local cortical administration of both risperidone or idazoxan enhanced the 5-HT efflux in the FC, whereas local raphe administration of risperidone but not idazoxan increased the output of 5-HT in the DRN. 4. Systemic administration of risperidone (200 micrograms/kg, i.v.) or the selective alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (400 micrograms/kg, i.v.) decreased, whereas selective alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist idazoxan (20 micrograms/kg, i.v.) increased the 5-HT cell firing in the DRN. 5. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100,635 (5.0 micrograms/kg, i.v.) effectively antagonized the inhibition of 5-HT cells induced by risperidone, but failed to prevent the prazosin-induced decrease in 5-HT cell firing in the DRN. 6.

Consequently, the risperidone-induced increase in 5-HT output in the FC may be related to its alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonistic action, an effect probably executed at the nerve terminal level, whereas the reduction in 5-HT cell firing by risperidone appears to be associated with increased availability of 5-HT in the somatodendritic region of the neurones leading to an enhanced 5-HT1A autoreceptor activation and, in turn, to inhibition of cell firing.",,England,1998,10.1016/s0278-5846(98)00042-6,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9723122

Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are located in many regions of the brain, including areas important for cognitive function such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Nicotinic agonists have been found in rodent and non-human primate studies to improve performance on a variety of memory tasks. In a complementary fashion, nicotinic antagonists such as mecamylamine impair working memory function. In humans, similar effects have been seen. Nicotinic agonist treatment can improve attention, learning and memory and nicotinic antagonist treatment can cause deficits. To define the neural substrates of nicotinic involvement in cognitive function, three areas of investigation are underway. 1) Critical neuroanatomic loci for nicotinic effects are beginning to be determined. The hippocampus, frontal cortex and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei have been found to be important sites of action for nicotinic involvement in memory function. 2) Nicotinic receptor subtype involvement in cognitive function is being studied. There has been considerable recent work identifying nicotinic receptor subunit conformation including alpha and beta subunits. Nicotinic receptor subtypes appear to be associated with different functional systems; however, much remains to be done to determine the precise role each subtype plays in terms of cognitive function. 3) Nicotinic interactions with other transmitter systems are being assessed. Nicotine receptors interact in important ways with other systems to affect cognitive functioning, including muscarinic ACh, dopamine, norepinepherine, serotonin, glutamate, and other systems. Nicotinic function in clinical populations and potential for therapeutics has been investigated for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Areas which need to receive greater attention are the exact anatomical location and the specific receptor subtypes critically involved in nicotine's effects.

Compared with normoxic adults, none of these values were significantly different in hypoxic adults and in fetuses only the pKb values for ketanserin against 5-HT in the 2BR segments (8.8) were greater. From these results we propose that the ratio of 5-HT2 to 5-HT1 receptors is greatest in the Com and decreases progressively to its smallest values in 2BR or smaller segments.

Rats were given daily injections of nicotine (0.15 or 0.60 mg/kg, s.c., freebase) or saline for 4 days, then challenged with either nicotine or saline. A regimen of inescapable electrical footshocks or no footshocks was then administered. Thirty minutes after final injection, rats were sacrificed, brains removed and dopamine (DA) and its metabolite dihydroxy-O-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were extracted from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) and dorsolateral striatum and quantified by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Acute administration of low dose nicotine (0.15 mg/kg) produced an increase in DA utilization (increased DOPAC/DA ratio) in mPFC and NAS, but not striatum. High dose nicotine (0.60 mg/kg) produced activation in NAS, but not mPFC or striatum. Repeated low dose nicotine pre-treatment produced tolerance to the effects of nicotine challenge in the mPFC, and reduced its effects in NAS. Footshock stress preferentially increased DA utilization in mPFC and associated footshock stress-induced immobility responses, and these were reduced by low, but not high, dose repeated nicotine pre-treatment. Further, a single dose of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine (MCA) 30 min prior to nicotine challenge dose-dependently blocked the reduction of mesoprefrontal DA stress responsivity and immobility responses produced by repeated nicotine pre-treatment. These results indicate that: (1) there are dose-dependent differential effects of acute and repeated nicotine pre-exposure on regional DA utilization; (2) low, but not high, dose repeated nicotine reduces both the mesoprefrontal DA and behavioral effects of acute footshock stress; and (3) these effects of repeated nicotine may depend on mecamylamine-sensitive nAChR stimulation.

Hyperpolarization of the membrane decreased or caused no apparent change in 5-HTD. 5-HTD were reduced in an elevated [K+]o (7.0 mM) solution and > 60% in a low Na+ (26 mM) solution and were not significantly changed in a low Cl- (6.7 mM) or Ca(2+)-free/high Mg2+ (10.9 mM) solution. The 5-HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT (50 microM) depolarized RVLM neurons, and the 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin (1-10 microM) attenuated the 5-HTD and the depolarizing phase of biphasic responses, whereas the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist PBD (2 microM) was without effect. Inclusion of the hydrolysis resistant guanine nucleotide GDP-beta-S in patch solution significantly reduced the 5-HTH as well as the 5-HTD. The present study shows that, in the immature rat RVLM neurons, 5-HT causes a slow hyperpolarization and depolarization probably by interacting with 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, which are G-proteins coupled. 5-HTH may involve an increase of an inwardly rectifying K+ conductance, and 5-HTD appear to be caused by a decrease of K+ conductance and/or increase of nonselective cation conductance.",,United States,1998,10.1152/jn.1998.80.3.1033,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9744919

NMDA antagonists might prove to be useful treatments, unfortunately, some can produce phencyclidine (PCP)-like side effects. The polyamine-site modulators, spermine (SPM) and spermidine (SPD), produce dose related biphasic modulation of NMDA channel currents while another polyamine, arcaine (ARC), produces only negative modulatory effects. The PCP-like effects of these compounds were tested in rats trained to discriminate PCP from saline in a standard two-lever drug discrimination paradigm under a fixed ratio schedule of food reinforcement. SPM, SPD and ARC occasioned little, if any, responding on the PCP-associated lever, even at response rate suppressing doses. The results provide further evidence that differences exist between the discriminative stimulus effects produced by drugs active at different sites on the NMDA receptor and suggest that the polyamine modulatory site should be a good target for development of NMDA antagonist medications with a reduced propensity for PCP-like acute behavioral effects.",,Ireland,1998,10.1016/s0304-3940(98)00606-5,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9754803

L 745,870 similarly showed selectivity for hD4 (2.5 nM) vs. hD2 (905 nM) and hD3 (> 3000 nM) receptors. In contrast, raclopride displayed low affinity at hD4 (> 3000 nM) vs. hD2 (1.1 nM) and hD3 receptors (1.4 nM). Stimulation of [35S]-GTPgammaS binding at hD4 receptors by dopamine (DA) was blocked by S 18126 and L 745,870 with Kb values of 2.2 and 1.0 nM, respectively, whereas raclopride (> 1000 nM) was inactive. In contrast, raclopride inhibited stimulation of [35S]-GTPgammaS binding at hD2 sites by DA with a Kb of 1.4 nM, whereas S 18126 (> 1000 nM) and L 745,870 (> 1000 nM) were inactive. As concerns presynaptic dopaminergic receptors, raclopride (0.01-0.05 mg/kg s.c. ) markedly enhanced DA synthesis in mesocortical, mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways. In contrast, even high doses (2. 5-40.0 mg/kg s.c.) of S 18126 and L 745,870 were only weakly active. Similarly, raclopride (0.016 mg/kg i.v.) abolished inhibition of the firing rate of ventrotegmental dopaminergic neurons by apomorphine, whereas even high doses (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) of S 18126 and L 745,870 were only weakly active. As regards postsynaptic dopaminergic receptors, raclopride potently (0.01-0.3 mg/kg s.c.) reduced rotation elicited by quinpirole in rats with unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra, antagonized induction of hypothermia by PD 128, 907, blocked amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and was effective in six further models of potential antipsychotic activity. In contrast, S 18126 and L 745,870 were only weakly active in these models (5.0-> 40.0 mg/kg s.c.). In six models of extrapyramidal and motor symptoms, such as induction of catalepsy, raclopride was likewise potently active (0.01-2.0 mg/kg s.c.) whereas S 18126 and L 745,870 were only weakly active (10.0-80.0 mg/kg s.c.). In freely moving rats, raclopride (0.16 mg/kg s.c.) increased levels of DA by + 55% in dialysates of the frontal cortex. However, it also increased levels of DA in the accumbens and striatum by 70% and 75%, respectively. In contrast to raclopride, at a dose of 0.16 mg/kg s.c. , neither S 18126 nor L 745,870 modified frontal cortex levels of DA. However, at a high dose (40.0 mg/kg s.c.), S 18126 increased dialysate levels of DA (+ 85%) and noradrenaline (+ 100%), but not serotonin (+ 10%), in frontal cortex without affecting DA levels in accumbens (+ 10%) and striatum (+ 10%). In conclusion, S 18126 and L 745,870 behave as potent and selective antagonists of cloned, hD4 vs. other dopaminergic receptor types in vitro. However, their in vivo effects at high doses probably reflect residual antagonist actions at D2 (or D3) receptors.

Perfusion of 5, 25 and 100 microM quinpirole (a D2 agonist), or sulpiride (a D2 antagonist) through the microdialysis probe in the VTA produced dose-related decreases or increases, respectively, in the extracellular levels of DA in both the VTA and ACB of adult Wistar rats. The IP administration of 2-3 g/kg ethanol produced a sustained increase in the extracellular levels of DA (150-200% of baseline) in the ACB for at least 2 h after injection, whereas only a transient increase was observed in the VTA. Local perfusion of the ACB with 100 microM GBR12909, a DA uptake inhibitor, elevated the extracellular levels of DA in the ACB to approximately 400% of baseline, but decreased the extracellular levels of DA in the VTA to approximately 50% of baseline. Overall, the results suggest that (a) there is an association between somatodendritic and terminal field DA release when D2 cell body autoreceptors in the VTA are manipulated, (b) elevating synaptic levels of DA in the terminal field activates a long-loop negative feedback system to the VTA, and (c) different mechanisms may be mediating the actions of ethanol on DA neuronal activity and terminal DA release.",,Germany,1998,10.1007/s002130050692,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9768545

Plasma 5-HT increased significantly over time after reperfusion; the plateau level was obtained 4 h after reperfusion and was associated with an increase in 5-HIAA. Plasma tryptophan levels declined gradually after reperfusion. The ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT was significantly higher in I/R rats than in control rats, suggesting that elevated 5-HT was quickly metabolized in the systemic circulation. In the intestine, 5-HT decreased dramatically, whereas tryptophan increased. This phenomenon was prominent in the severely damaged intestine. These findings suggest that the injured intestine released large amounts of 5-HT, whereas its synthesis in the injured intestine was suppressed.

Among disorders associated with a primary impairment of dopaminergic transmission are Parkinson's disease, striatonigral degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and possibly schizophrenia. Diseases of secondary dopamine dysfunction are chiefly represented by Huntington's disease in which dopaminergic transmission is being interrupted by progressive loss of the striatal neurons bearing the postsynaptic D1- and D2-dopamine receptors. Central dopaminergic systems have anatomical as well as organizational properties that render them unique by comparison to other neurotransmission systems, making them able to play a pivotal role in the modulation of various important brain functions such as locomotor activity, attention, and some cognitive abilities. These properties of dopamine neurons have obviously several implications in the clinical expression of human disorders involving dopamine neuron dysfunction.

The design of subtype-specific cholinergic drugs is dependent on identification of key amino acids that play a significant role in determining subunit-specific agonist efficacy. 1,1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (DMPP) and a series of piperazium (PIP)-derived cholinergic agonists (1,1 dimethyl-4-acetylpiperizinium iodide, EthylPIP, PropylPIP, and ButylPIP) were used to identify a site (position 84) in homomeric neuronal nAChRs, which is a partial determinant of pharmacological specificity. In contrast to absolutely conserved amino acids within the nicotinic superfamily, the amino acid in position 84 can be polar or nonpolar. The addition of one methylene to PropylPIP to form ButylPIP eliminated channel activation of but not binding to the chick alpha7 homomeric nAChR (leucine in position 84). In rat alpha7 (glutamine in position 84), ButylPIP was an agonist. 1, 1-Dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium, a structural analog of ButylPIP, activates the rat alpha7 but is a weak partial agonist of the chick alpha7. Mutation of the chick alpha7 (L84Q) restored activation by ButylPIP, and the corresponding mutation in rat alpha7 (Q84L) abolished activation by ButylPIP. These mutations had moderate effects on the apparent affinity for acetylcholine, increasing its affinity for chick alpha7 and decreasing it for rat alpha7. Thus, the amino acid in position 84 (a residue on the periphery of the highly conserved loop A of the cys-loop superfamily of receptors) can potentially be exploited to produce subtype-specific drugs and can provide insights into the structure of the binding domain.",,United States,1999,10.1124/mol.55.1.1,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9882691

Although the presence of small amounts of dopamine (DA) in several limbic structures has been recognized for a long time, for many years it was thought that limbic DA represented a precursor of noradrenaline in the biosynthetic pathway of catecholamines. More recent evidence has shown that limbic centres and nuclei are supplied with a dopaminergic innervation arising from the ventral tegmental area (field A10) and in smaller amounts from the mesencephalic A9 field. The dopaminergic limbic system is sensitive to ageing. Parameters of dopaminergic neurotransmission (DA levels, biosynthetic and catabolic markers and DA receptors) undergo age-related changes which depend on the structure and species investigated and are characterized mainly by a decline of different parameters examined. In this paper, the influence of ageing on DA biosynthesis, levels, metabolism and receptors are reviewed in laboratory rodents, monkeys and humans as well as in cases of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The possibility that changes of dopaminergic neurotransmission markers in the limbic system are associated with cognitive impairment and psychotic symptoms affecting the elderly is discussed.

682e2ae1-ba90-4921-81d3-33d9f75ed740,Pharmacologic strategies for augmenting cognitive performance in schizophrenia.,Friedman JI and Temporini H and Davis KL ,Biological psychiatry,,"There is recognition that the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia have the most substantial impact on illness outcome. Domains of cognition reported to be significantly affected include serial learning, executive function, vigilance, and distractibility, to name a few. Dopamine activity at D1 receptors mediates many cognitive processes subserved by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly working memory. The number of D1 receptors in the PFC is decreased in schizophrenics and is unaffected by chronic administration of typical neuroleptics. Therefore, medications that increase dopamine in the PFC, such as atypical neuroleptics, or that directly activate the D1 receptor may prove useful in the remediation of prefrontal-dependent cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Decreased levels of cortical norepinephrine (NE) are associated with impaired learning and working memory in animal models, and can be reversed by drugs that restore NE activity. More specifically, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists have been particularly effective in improving delayed response performance in young monkeys with localized 6-hydroxydopamine lesions in the PFC. Furthermore, human postmortem studies have demonstrated decreased NE in the frontal cortex of demented schizophrenic patients. Therefore, alpha-2 receptor agonists hold promise as drugs to improve cognitive performance on tasks dependent upon PFC function in schizophrenics. Finally, the finding that cortical choline acetyl transferase activity correlates with Clinical Dementia Rating scores in schizophrenic patients and that cholinomimetic drugs enhance cognition in healthy subjects suggests that cholinergic drugs may also treat cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. Two potential types of cholinomimetics for use in schizophrenics are the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and M1/M4 muscarinic agonists, both of which increase cortical cholinergic activity.",,United States,1999,10.1016/s0006-3223(98)00287-x,Journal Article and Review,,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9894570

METHODS: The alpha-1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, was infused into the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats (0.1 microgram/0.5 microL) performing a spatial working memory task, delayed alternation. The phenylephrine response was challenged with coinfusion of the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, uripidil (0.01 microgram), or with a dose of lithium chloride (4 mEq/kg, i.p., 18 hours) known to suppress phosphotidylinositol (PI) turnover, the second messenger pathway coupled to alpha-1 adrenoceptors. RESULTS: Phenylephrine infusions in PFC markedly impaired delayed alternation performance. The phenylephrine response was reversed by coinfusion of uripidil, or by pretreatment with lithium, consistent with actions at alpha-1 adrenoceptors coupled to a PI pathway. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that alpha-1 adrenoceptor stimulation in the PFC impairs cognitive function.

This dissociation is particularly evident in the temporal profiles of the extracellular dopamine and stereotypy responses to higher doses of amphetamine. One possible mechanism contributing to this temporal dissociation is that during the acute response to amphetamine, dopamine receptor mechanisms are enhanced such that stereotyped behaviors can be supported by synaptic concentrations of dopamine which are not sufficient to initiate these behaviors. To further explore the dynamics of stimulant sensitivity during the acute response, we examined the behavioral and extracellular dopamine responses to a low, nonstereotypy-producing dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) at various times after an acute, priming injection of 4.0 mg/kg when stereotypies had subsided and extracellular dopamine was approaching predrug baseline levels. The low-dose challenge produced intense stereotypies although the regional dopamine responses were not significantly different from control animals. Blockade of the expression of stereotypies during the priming response by the D2 antagonist haloperidol or the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 prevented the expression of an enhanced stereotypy response to the challenge injection. Our results suggest that an exposure to amphetamine results in a rapid sensitization of the stereotypy response which does not involve changes in the extracellular dopamine response but requires activation of dopamine receptors. Such a mechanism may be significantly implicated during binge patterns of stimulant abuse and may also play a role in the sensitization associated with repeated amphetamine administration.",,United States,1999,,"Journal Article and Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9918578

The immunogen E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, endotoxin) has been widely used to stimulate immune/inflammatory responses both systemically and in the CNS. Here, we show that exposure of parietal cortical slices from adult rats to LPS triggered very rapid (<2.5 min) and sustained releases of the neurotransmitters glutamate and noradrenaline, and of the neuromodulator adenosine. The responses to LPS declined rapidly following removal of the LPS and exhibited no tachyphylaxis to repeated exposures to LPS. The detoxified form of LPS had no effect. LPS-evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline, but not of glutamate or adenosine, appears to be partly due to the released glutamate acting at ionotropic receptors on the noradrenergic axons present in the cortical slices. LPS appears to release glutamate, which then acts at non-NMDA receptors to remove the voltage-sensitive Mg2+ block of NMDA receptors, thus permitting NMDA receptors to be activated and noradrenaline release to proceed. It seems possible that rapid, inappropriate excitation may occur in the immediate vicinity of gram-negative bacterial infections in the brain. If similar inappropriate excitations are also triggered by those immunogens specifically associated with Alzheimer's disease (beta-amyloid), AIDS dementia (gp120 and gp41), or multiple sclerosis (myelin basic protein), they might explain some of the acute, transient neurological and psychiatric symptoms associated with these disorders.",,England,1999,10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0720652.x,"Journal Article and Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,pubmed-9930737
