SENSORY GATING IS A MECHANISM FOR DOSING AND FILTERING THE INCOMING INFORMATION, BY WHICH THE BRAIN REGULATES THE RESPONSES TO SENSORY STIMULI COMING FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. SENSORY GATING DEFICIT IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE SCHIZOPHRENIA ENDOPHENOTYPES. TAAR1 AGONIST AT A 1 MG/KG DOSAGE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SENSORY GATING INDEX (S1-S2) INCREASE. SENSORY GATING INDEX ROSE DUE TO THE N40 AMPLITUDE INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST STIMULUS IN A PAIR, WHEREAS THE AMPLITUDE OF THE SECOND STIMULUS REMAINED UNCHANGED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SENSORY GATING IN MICE MAY BE MODULATED THROUGH TAAR1-DEPENDENT PROCESSES, INDICATING POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION OF TAAR1 AND TRACE AMINES IN GENERAL TO THE NEUROPHARMACOLOGY OF COGNITIVE PROCESSES. © 2019 LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS AND WILKINS.

dissertation published elsewhere,3b4e8d12-eed8-4824-975d-0ed644d65e92,Regulation of monoaminergic functions by GPCRS with a special emphasis on mental and movement disorders,Ioannis Mantas,Dissertation Abstracts International,,"Dysfunction of the brain's monoaminergic system has been implicated in many human neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia. The monoamines that are most dysregulated in these diseases, are dopamine and serotonin. Monoamines act as signalling molecules through their receptors, which belong predominately to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily1. Most of the clinically employed drugs that are used to tackle these diseases, target directly or indirectly the monoaminergic class of GPCRs. This thesis aims to identify the role of four understudied GPCR-signalling related molecules (GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1) in animal models of PD, MDD and schizophrenia.The main findings relate to the functions of GPR88, TAAR1, p11 and NURR1 in relationship to PD, MDD and schizophrenia. GPR88 has been suggested as crucial suppressor of striatal medium spiny neuron activity. We showed that loss of GPR88 facilitates L- dihydroxyphenylalanine treatment for PD by aiding its therapeutic efficacy without worsening its side effects. TAAR1 has been described as negative regulator of dopamine neurons firing rate. Herein, we report that TAAR1 deletion enhances the response of non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors but no other classes of antidepressants. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the antipsychotic action of the pioneering drug, SEP-856, depends in part on TAAR1 agonism. P11 is a small GPCR-adaptor protein that has been linked to MDD and antidepressant treatment response. In the current thesis, we demonstrate that loss of p11 causes an overt response to stress by triggering the activity of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adrenomedullary axes. Finally, NURR1 is a GPCR regulated transcription factor, which is linked to PD and schizophrenia as a consequence of its fundamental role in coordinating midbrain dopamine neuron development. In the present work, we describe the role of NURR1 in extra-dopaminergic brain structures such as striatum and claustrum. In detail, we show that induced striatal NURR1 is crucial for locomotor sensitization to L-DOPA. Moreover, we revealed that NURR1 is important factor for claustral neuron transcriptional identity without affecting the occurrence of hallucinogen states' neural correlates.Overall, we explored new avenues in the fields of neurology and psychiatry related molecular neurobiology. These findings may support future drug discovery research on PD, MDD and schizophrenia though the identification of novel pharmaceutical agents to treat these detrimental disorders. Thus, this body of work contributes to the better understanding of both the pharmacology and pathophysiology of mental and movement disorders.

WHILE SELECTIVE AGONISTS FOR TAAR1 HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED, ONLY ONE HIGH AFFINITY TAAR1 ANTAGONIST HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THUS FAR. WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED FOUR POTENTIAL LOW POTENCY TAAR1 ANTAGONISTS THROUGH AN IN SILICO SCREEN ON A TAAR1 HOMOLOGY MODEL. ONE OF THE IDENTIFIED ANTAGONISTS (COMPOUND 22) WAS PREDICTED TO HAVE FAVORABLE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES, WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DRUG TO CROSS THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. IN VIVO STUDIES WERE THEREFORE CARRIED OUT AND SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 POTENTIATES AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT COMPOUND 22 INCREASED FIRING OF DOPAMINE NEURONS SIMILAR TO EPPTB, THE ONLY KNOWN TAAR1 ANTAGONIST. IN ORDER TO ASSESS WHETHER THE EFFECTS OF COMPOUND 22 WERE MEDIATED THROUGH TAAR1, EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT ON TAAR1-KO MICE. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPOUND 22 IS ABLE TO ENHANCE AMPHETAMINE- AND COCAINE-MEDIATED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY, EVEN IN TAAR1-KO MICE, SUGGESTING THAT THE IN VIVO EFFECTS OF THIS COMPOUND ARE NOT MEDIATED BY TAAR1. IN COLLABORATION WITH PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM, WE ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22. PSYCHOACTIVE DRUG SCREENING PROGRAM (PDSP) RESULTS SUGGESTED SEVERAL POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR COMPOUND 22 INCLUDING, THE DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE AND SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; AS WELL AS SIGMA 1 AND 2 RECEPTORS. OUR FOLLOW-UP STUDIES USING HETEROLOGOUS CELL SYSTEMS SHOWED THAT THE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER IS NOT A TARGET OF COMPOUND 22.

correction,9f4217dc-d370-43b2-8178-e10c1d114948,Correction to: TAAR1 dependent and independent actions of the potential antipsychotic and dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist SEP- 363856,"Saarinen, Marcus and Mantas, Ioannis and Flais, Ivana and Agren, Richard and Sahlholm, Kristoffer and Millan, Mark J and Svenningsson, Per ",Neuropsychopharmacology,Neuropsychopharmacology,"Reports an error in ""TAAR1 dependent and independent actions of the potential antipsychotic and dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist SEP-383856"" by Marcus Saarinen, Ioannis Mantas, Ivana Flais, Richard Agren, Kristoffer Sahlholm, Mark J. Millan and Per Svenningsson (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2022[Dec], Vol 47[13], 2319-2329). The technical name of the compound studied in this article was incorrectly referred to as SEP-383856 in the title and the abstract and has now been corrected to SEP-363856. None of the scientific conclusions in this paper are affected by this correction. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2023-02373-001). SEP-383856 (SEP-856) is a novel antipsychotic under clinical development. It displays a unique pattern of receptor interaction, with only weak (partial agonist) activity at dopamine D2 receptors, yet more potent agonist activity at the trace amine associated receptor (TAAR1) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1 A receptor (5-HT1A). Nonetheless, these observations await independent confirmation and more detailed characterization of the in vitro and in vivo actions of SEP-856 at TAAR1 and 5-HT1A receptors would be instructive. Herein, we employed luminescence complementation technology in heterologous live cell systems, confocal microscopy, voltage clamp electrophysiology, behavioral readouts and TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice to study SEP-856 in further detail. We provide evidence for the ability of SEP-856 to activate TAAR1 at the surface plasma membrane, and show that this interaction results in Galphas recruitment (pEC50: 6.08 +/- 0.22 EMAX: 96.41% +/- 15.26) and by extension, to G-protein inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel activation. Using TAAR1-KO mice, we find TAAR1 to be indispensable for SEP-856 control of body temperature, baseline locomotion reduction and for ""antipsychotic-like"" efficacy as characterized by a reversal of dizocilipine (MK-801) mediated disruption of pre-pulse inhibition. Conversely, the inhibition by SEP-856 of MK-801 induced locomotion was unaffected in TAAR1 KO mice. SEP-856 behaved as a low-potency, partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, while it partially inhibited recruitment of D2 receptor-coupled Galpha and GIRK by DA and acted as a weak partial agonist with low potency at the same receptor when applied alone. Our findings corroborate and extend previous observations on the molecular substrates engaged by this unique, dual TAAR1/5-HT1A receptor agonist and potential antipsychotic that could prove to have major advantages in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.

TAAR1 ARE WELL-DOCUMENTED TO PLAY A MODULATORY ROLE IN THE DOPAMINERGIC SYSTEM. IN SPITE OF A GROWING NUMBER OF STUDIES OF TAAR1 EFFECTS, LITTLE IS STILL KNOWN ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL PHARMACOLOGY OF TAAR1 LIGANDS, INCLUDING EFFECTS OF REPEATED TAAR1 AGONIST ADMINISTRATION. THE PRESENT STUDY APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST THAT ESTIMATED THE ACTION OF TAAR1 AGONISTS ON SCHEDULE-INDUCED POLYDIPSIA, A TYPE OF ADJUNCTIVE BEHAVIOR, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE USEFUL FOR EVALUATING CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE AND RELATED DISORDERS (OCD) AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. OUR RESULTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE WIDE RANGE OF RO5263397, THE HIGHLY SELECTIVE PARTIAL TAAR1 AGONIST, DOSES (1–10 MG/KG) ATTENUATED THE POLYDIPSIA INDUCED BY TWO DIFFERENT SCHEDULES OF FOOD DELIVERY IN RATS. THE EFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR THE 7 DAYS OF REPEATED TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE HIGHEST TESTED DOSES OF RO5263397 (6 AND 10 MG/KG) DECREASED THE VERTICAL LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY OF THE ANIMALS AND THE VOLUME OF WATER INTAKE OF THIRSTY RATS FOLLOWING THE ACUTE TREATMENT. ALSO, THOUGH, THE REPEATED RO5263397 ADMINISTRATION IS EXHIBITED TO DIMINISH THE VOLUME OF CONSUMED WATER AND WEIGHT OF RATS WITHOUT SIP, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE TOLERANCE WAS OBSERVED TO THESE DRUG EFFECTS. IN GENERAL, THE RO5263397 DECREASES SPECIFICALLY THE ADJUNCTIVE DRINKING AND THIS EFFECT IS MAINTAINED WITH REPEATED DRUG ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOLERANCE. THE INTERPRETATION OF THESE RESULTS AS AN EVIDENCE FOR THE RO5263397 ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE ACTION, HOWEVER, SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION BECAUSE THE DRUG ALSO INFLUENCED THE DRINKING BEHAVIOR AND ONLY WEAKLY AFFECTED THE OTHER PARAMETERS OF SIP USED TO REVEAL THE POTENTIAL ANTICOMPULSIVE-LIKE EFFECTS OF DRUGS. © 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055719905&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuropharm.2018.10.034&partnerID=40&md5=00d6c2db2f6fc4e4ea0852ffc0b36e87,Netherlands,2019,10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.10.034,ARTICLE,"ANIMALS;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL;DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP, DRUG;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;MALE;MOTOR ACTIVITY;NEUROTRANSMITTER AGENTS;OXAZOLES;POLYDIPSIA;RATS, WISTAR;RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED;TIME FACTORS;4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYLPHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDROOXAZOL 2 AMINE;DOPAMINE RECEPTOR AFFECTING AGENT;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;RO 5263397;TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;UNCLASSIFIED DRUG;4-(3-FLUORO-2-METHYLPHENYL)-4,5-DIHYDROOXAZOL-2-YLAMINE;AGENTS INTERACTING WITH TRANSMITTER, HORMONE OR DRUG RECEPTORS;G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR;OXAZOLE DERIVATIVE;TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1;ANIMAL EXPERIMENT;ANIMAL MODEL;ANTICOMPULSIVE LIKE EFFECT;ARTICLE;COMPULSION;CONTROLLED STUDY;DRINKING BEHAVIOR;DRUG EFFICACY;DRUG MECHANISM;DRUG SELECTIVITY;DRUG TOLERANCE;EVENING DOSAGE;FLUID INTAKE;FOOD INTAKE;LOCOMOTION;MALE;MORNING DOSAGE;NONHUMAN;POLYDIPSIA;PRIORITY JOURNAL;RAT;RECEPTOR UPREGULATION;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;SCHEDULE INDUCED POLYDIPSIA;TREATMENT DURATION;AGONISTS;ANIMAL;APPETITIVE BEHAVIOR;DISEASE MODEL;DOSE RESPONSE;DRUG EFFECT;FEEDING BEHAVIOR;METABOLISM;MOTOR ACTIVITY;PHYSIOLOGY;POLYDIPSIA;TIME FACTOR;WISTAR RAT",,31/08/2023 13:56,f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a,LSR3_SyRF_upload,2-S2.0-85055719905
