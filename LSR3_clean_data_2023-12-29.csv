THE MAJOR FUNCTION OF THE PLASMA MEMBRANE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (DAT) IS THE RAPID UPTAKE OF RELEASED DA INTO PRESYNAPTIC NERVE TERMINALS LEADING TO CONTROL OF BOTH THE EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DA AND THE INTRACELLULAR STORES OF DA. HERE, WE PRESENT A NEWLY DEVELOPED STRAIN OF RATS IN WHICH THE GENE ENCODINGDATKNOCKOUT RATS (DAT-KO) HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY USING ZINC FINGER NUCLEASE TECHNOLOGY. MALE AND FEMALE DAT-KO RATS DEVELOP NORMALLY BUT WEIGH LESS THAN HETEROZYGOTE AND WILD-TYPE RATS AND DEMONSTRATE PRONOUNCED SPONTANEOUS LOCOMOTOR HYPERACTIVITY. WHILE STRIATAL EXTRACELLULAR DA LIFETIME AND CONCENTRATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, THE TOTAL TISSUE CONTENT OF DA IS MARKEDLY DECREASED DEMONSTRATING THE KEY ROLE OF DAT IN THE CONTROL OF DA NEUROTRANSMISSION.

Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) mice, in particular, have been widely used to study ADHD. Recently, a strain of DAT KO rats has been developed (1). Here, we provide a phenotypic characterization of reward sensitivity and compulsive choice by adult rats born from DAT-HET dams bred with DAT-HET males, in order to further validate DAT KO rats as an animal model for preclinical research. We first tested DAT KO rats' sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, provided by highly appetitive food or sweet water: then, we tested their choice behavior with an Intolerance-to-Delay Task (IDT). During these tests, DAT KO rats appeared less sensitive to rewarding stimuli than wild-type (WT) and HET rats: they also showed a prominent hyperactive behavior with a rigid choice pattern and a wide number of compulsive stereotypies. Moreover, during the IDT, we tested the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and RO-5203648, a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial agonist. AMPH accentuated impulsive-behaviors in WT and HET rats, while it had no effect in DAT KO rats. Finally, we measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine receptor 2 (D2), serotonin transporter, and TAAR1 mRNA transcripts in samples of ventral striatum, finding no significant differences between WT and KO genotypes.

HERE WE REPORT ON THE IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF THE FIRST SELECTIVE AND POTENT TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST. METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES.

TAS ARE LIGANDS FOR THE RECENTLY IDENTIFIED TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), AN IMPORTANT MODULATOR OF MONOAMINE NEUROTRANSMISSION. HERE, WE SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF TAAR1 HYPERSIGNALING BY GENERATING A TRANSGENIC MOUSE LINE OVEREXPRESSING TAAR1 SPECIFICALLY IN NEURONS. TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE DID NOT SHOW OVERT BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES UNDER BASELINE CONDITIONS, DESPITE AUGMENTED EXTRACELLULAR LEVELS OF DOPAMINE AND NORADRENALINE IN THE ACCUMBENS NUCLEUS (ACB) AND OF SEROTONIN IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX. IN VITRO, THIS WAS CORRELATED WITH AN ELEVATED SPONTANEOUS FIRING RATE OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA, DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, AND LOCUS COERULEUS AS THE RESULT OF ECTOPIC TAAR1 EXPRESSION. FURTHERMORE, TAAR1 TRANSGENIC MICE WERE HYPOSENSITIVE TO THE PSYCHOSTIMULANT EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE, AS IT PRODUCED ONLY A WEAK LOCOMOTOR ACTIVATION AND FAILED TO ALTER CATECHOLAMINE RELEASE IN THE ACB. ATTENUATING TAAR1 ACTIVITY WITH THE SELECTIVE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5073012 RESTORED THE STIMULATING EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE ON LOCOMOTION. OVERALL, THESE DATA SHOW THAT TAAR1 BRAIN OVEREXPRESSION CAUSES HYPOSENSITIVITY TO AMPHETAMINE AND ALTERATIONS OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION.

GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING ANTIPSYCHOTICS, THERE IS URGENT NEED FOR NOVEL DRUGS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES.

GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING ANTIPSYCHOTICS, THERE IS URGENT NEED FOR NOVEL DRUGS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. SEP-363856 (SEP-856) IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT CURRENTLY UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL INVESTIGATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF AN ACUTE ORAL SEP-856 ADMINISTRATION TO MODULATE THE FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY OF SPECIFIC BRAIN REGIONS AT BASAL LEVELS AND UNDER GLUTAMATERGIC OR DOPAMINERGIC-PERTURBED CONDITIONS IN ADULT RATS. WE FOUND THAT IMMEDIATE-EARLY GENES (IEGS) EXPRESSION WAS STRONGLY UPREGULATED IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND, TO A LESS EXTENT, IN THE VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS, SUGGESTING AN ACTIVATION OF THESE REGIONS. FURTHERMORE, SEP-856 WAS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING THE HYPERACTIVITY INDUCED BY AN ACUTE INJECTION OF PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP), BUT NOT OF D-AMPHETAMINE (AMPH). THE COMPOUND EFFECTIVELY NORMALIZED THE PCP-INDUCED INCREASE IN IEGS EXPRESSION IN THE PFC AT ALL DOSES TESTED, WHEREAS ONLY THE HIGHEST DOSE DETERMINED THE MAJOR MODULATIONS ON AMPH-INDUCED CHANGES. LASTLY, SEP-856 ACUTE ADMINISTRATION CORRECTED THE COGNITIVE DEFICITS PRODUCED BY SUBCHRONIC PCP ADMINISTRATION.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS. PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION WITH SEP-363856, A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH AGONISM AT TRACE AMINE RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS BUT NO APPRECIABLE ACTION AT DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE KETAMINE-INDUCED INCREASE IN DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE TREATMENT IN MICE MIMICS THE DOPAMINERGIC ALTERATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS, THAT THIS REQUIRES ACTIVATION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND CAN BE AMELIORATED BY ACTIVATING PV INTERNEURONS AND BY A TAAR1/5-HT1A AGONIST.

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY). IN CONTRAST, RO5166017 DID NOT CHANGE THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF NORADRENERGIC NEURONS IN THE LOCUS COERULEUS, AN AREA DEVOID OF TAAR1 EXPRESSION.

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068",2023-08-31 13:56:51,"f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","Unclear","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,"cocaine",20,"miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"0.1",NA,"mg/kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,NA,"Oral administration/gavage",NA,"Single dose",NA,"1",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",60,"Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Exact number",8,999,999,999,999,"Weeks","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Grams (g)","No",2023-11-10 23:39:10,"ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7","Fig 1d","LMA - C, P - Olanz","Locomotor activity","48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a","532ed9f8-c5e1-4afa-ac8d-f8c652d5a03e","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,"34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc",FALSE,"cocaine","False",NA,"732b41f5-df8c-430a-b9a6-a36300887b4d",NA,"Simple intervention","RO5256390 0.1 Olanz cocaine",NA,"Intervention",NA,FALSE,1,47,"Mean","% inhibition",15,"SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7.48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a.1","Positive control","I","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0",8,0,12.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"TRUE","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0",8,0,12.3,34.7896536343781,"Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,47,15,42.4264068711929,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5256390","Other",FALSE,5,1.6,1.14517153432495,0.29098180759463,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.142857142857143,"Less than 1 week","Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5256390","Oral administration/gavage",0.1,"Locomotor activity",7.74,"TAAR1 full agonist","High",218.29,0.018,-586.015823240757,"0 criteria met",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.

IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE.

AS PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESSES, TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1) IS BECOMING A POTENTIAL NEW TARGET FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: WE USED MOLECULAR DOCKING AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS TO DISCOVER TAAR1 AGONISTS. THE AGONISTIC OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS ON TAAR1, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, AND DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS WERE DETERMINED. WE USED AN MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDS. WE ALSO PERFORMED A CATALEPSY ASSAY TO DETECT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS. TO EVALUATE THE DRUGGABILITY OF THE COMPOUNDS, WE CONDUCTED EVALUATIONS OF PERMEABILITY AND TRANSPORTER SUBSTRATES, LIVER MICROSOMAL STABILITY IN VITRO, HUMAN ETHER-À-GO-GO-RELATED GENE (HERG), PHARMACOKINETICS, AND TISSUE DISTRIBUTION. RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B. THE LATTER HAD HIGH TAAR1 AGONISTIC ACTIVITY BUT NO AGONISTIC EFFECT ON DOPAMINE D2-LIKE RECEPTORS AND DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR INHIBITION OF MK801-INDUCED SCHIZOPHRENIA-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MICE. INTERESTINGLY, 50B HAD FAVORABLE DRUGGABILITY AND THE ABILITY TO PENETRATE THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER (BBB) WITHOUT CAUSING EXTRAPYRAMIDAL SYMPTOMS (EPS), SUCH AS CATALEPSY IN MICE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFICIAL ROLE OF TAAR1 AGONISTS IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE DISCOVERY OF A STRUCTURALLY NOVEL TAAR1 AGONIST (50B) MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068",2023-08-31 13:56:51,"f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload",FALSE,"a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","Unclear","No","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No",FALSE,TRUE,"Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,"cocaine",20,"miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"0.1",NA,"mg/kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,NA,"Oral administration/gavage",NA,"Single dose",NA,"1",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)",60,"Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Exact number",8,999,999,999,999,"Weeks","Weight not reported",999,999,999,999,"Grams (g)","No",2023-11-10 23:39:10,"ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7","Fig 1d","LMA - C, P - Olanz","Locomotor activity","48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a","532ed9f8-c5e1-4afa-ac8d-f8c652d5a03e","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,"34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc",FALSE,"cocaine","False",NA,"732b41f5-df8c-430a-b9a6-a36300887b4d",NA,"Simple intervention","RO5256390 0.1 Olanz cocaine",NA,"Intervention",NA,FALSE,1,47,"Mean","% inhibition",15,"SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7.48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a.1","Positive control","I","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0",8,0,12.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,"TRUE","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0",8,0,12.3,34.7896536343781,"Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,47,15,42.4264068711929,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5256390","Other",FALSE,5,1.6,1.14517153432495,0.29098180759463,NA,NA,NA,NA,0.142857142857143,"Less than 1 week","Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5256390","Oral administration/gavage",0.1,"Locomotor activity",7.74,"TAAR1 full agonist","High",218.29,0.018,-586.015823240757,"0 criteria met",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CO-TREATMENT OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 FOR CONTROLLING SYMPTOMS AND WEIGHT GAIN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA DURING ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS. © 2022 BY THE AUTHORS.
