Recently, several selective taar 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities. However, it is unknown of the role of these ligands in modulating psychostimulant-induced neurobehavioral plasticity. This study examined the effects of a selective taar 1 agonist, ro5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15. Mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. Ro5263397 (1-10. Mg/kg, i.p.) Alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with ro5263397 (3.2 and 10. Mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity:  however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily ro5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32. Mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction. © 2014 elsevier ireland ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896090771&doi=10.1016%2fj.neulet.2014.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c9922f636007dfd20ecb3e17ae1baf90","Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, School Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences, University At Buffalo, The State University Of New York, Buffalo, Ny 14214, United States:  Department Of Neurology, University Hospital Of Hubei University For Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei 445000, China:  Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, Nc 27709, United States","2014","10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.024","article","animals:central nervous system stimulants:cocaine:cocaine-related disorders:dose-response relationship, drug:male:motor activity:rats, sprague-dawley:receptors, g-protein-coupled:behavioral sensitization:cocaine:rats:taar 1:amine:drugs used in the treatment of addiction:ro 5263397:trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist:unclassified drug:acute drug administration:animal experiment:animal model:article:chronic drug administration:cocaine dependence:controlled study:dose response:hyperactivity:locomotion:male:nerve cell plasticity:nonhuman:priority journal:rat:research:rodent model:sensitization",NA,NA,"16/02/2024 11:26","3201c55a-8aa2-4990-96da-99ea8dab451a","150224_SOLES_update","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,NA,"cocaine","10","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"10",NA,"miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,"7",NA,"Days",NA,NA,NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,"Single dose",NA,"-0.33",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Rat","Sprague-dawley (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","8","999","999","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","Yes","07/03/2025 09:48","e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689","Fig3","Loc15","668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d","07caab47-2ed1-42a3-9285-33e906cc7203","8","fc17a36d-703a-4ba2-b7ac-806cfaeaf740","FALSE","cocaine 10","FALSE",NA,"12cee811-564f-4a6e-911e-5db0ef5f2a52",NA,"Simple intervention","RO5263397 10",NA,"Intervention",NA,"TRUE","1","22.7","Mean","locomotion counts in 15 min","8","SD","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068.e8f4651d-dbd4-4d7f-b115-8414a783e689.668681b5-a04d-4d2b-89ca-50da6a77c32d.1","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","RO5263397","RO5263397","RO5263397, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","RO5263397, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"RO5263397",NA,"RO5263397, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","RO5263397","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068","The trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist ro5263397 attenuates the induction of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats","Thorn Da : Zhang C : Zhang Y : Li J-X","Neuroscience Letters",NA,"The trace amine associated receptor (taar) 1 is a new g protein coupled receptor that critically modulates central dopaminergic system.

Such diseases typically feature poor decision making and lack of control on executive functions and have been studied through the years using many animal models. Dopamine transporter (DAT) knockout (KO) and heterozygous (HET) mice, in particular, have been widely used to study ADHD. Recently, a strain of DAT KO rats has been developed (1). Here, we provide a phenotypic characterization of reward sensitivity and compulsive choice by adult rats born from DAT-HET dams bred with DAT-HET males, in order to further validate DAT KO rats as an animal model for preclinical research. We first tested DAT KO rats' sensitivity to rewarding stimuli, provided by highly appetitive food or sweet water: then, we tested their choice behavior with an Intolerance-to-Delay Task (IDT). During these tests, DAT KO rats appeared less sensitive to rewarding stimuli than wild-type (WT) and HET rats: they also showed a prominent hyperactive behavior with a rigid choice pattern and a wide number of compulsive stereotypies. Moreover, during the IDT, we tested the effects of amphetamine (AMPH) and RO-5203648, a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial agonist. AMPH accentuated impulsive-behaviors in WT and HET rats, while it had no effect in DAT KO rats. Finally, we measured the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine receptor 2 (D2), serotonin transporter, and TAAR1 mRNA transcripts in samples of ventral striatum, finding no significant differences between WT and KO genotypes.

METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS.

METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY. IN VARIOUS BEHAVIORAL PARADIGMS IN RODENTS AND MONKEYS, RO5203648 DEMONSTRATED CLEAR ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS POTENTIAL ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES. FURTHERMORE, IT ATTENUATED DRUG-TAKING BEHAVIOR AND WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING ATTENTION, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND WAKEFULNESS. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE FIRST POTENT AND SELECTIVE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST, RO5203648, WE SHOW THAT TAAR1 IS IMPLICATED IN A BROAD RANGE OF RELEVANT PHYSIOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND COGNITIVE NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DIMENSIONS.

METHODS: THE TAAR1 PARTIAL AGONIST RO5203648 WAS EVALUATED FOR ITS BINDING AFFINITY AND FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT RODENT AND PRIMATE TAAR1 RECEPTORS STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS, FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, FOR ITS EFFECTS ON THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF MONOAMINERGIC NEURONS EX VIVO, AND FOR ITS PROPERTIES IN VIVO WITH GENETIC AND PHARMACOLOGICAL MODELS OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. RESULTS: RO5203648 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENCY AT TAAR1, HIGH SELECTIVITY VERSUS OTHER TARGETS, AND FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5203648 INCREASED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY.

CURRENT TREATMENTS MANAGE THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, YET HAVE MINIMAL EFFECTS ON THE NEGATIVE AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, TWO PROMINENT FEATURES OF THE DISEASE WITH CRITICAL IMPACT ON THE LONG-TERM MORBIDITY. IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068","31/08/2023 13:56","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","30","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","8","999","999","999","999","Weeks","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","No","01/11/2023 00:00","e13d6fc8-8cec-4afd-8444-eda3d8e53e4a","Cocaine LMA RO5256390","LMA - C,P","Locomotor activity","0bf2f869-000e-4abd-ba4c-5c3d26bcc255","2369621f-d2fd-48c4-a211-068caea17cb4","6","1b9d0a79-df17-40ab-8c8e-88d5dcad9d38","TRUE",NA,"TRUE",NA,"4d65f5a1-2f29-46ef-b7c8-dab3d5ac2a78",NA,"Sham","vehicle control",NA,"Negative control",NA,"TRUE","1","24.4","Mean","% max","2.9","SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.e13d6fc8-8cec-4afd-8444-eda3d8e53e4a.0bf2f869-000e-4abd-ba4c-5c3d26bcc255.1",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5256390, 0.03 mg/kg","TvC","Pharmacological","Fig 1a C Ag Control",6,100.2,4,9.79795897113271,"Fig 1a C Ag 0.3",6,48.7,8.2,20.0858158908221,"Fig 1a C Ag Sham",6,24.4,2.9,7.10352025407122,TRUE,3.00720166175975,0.710135909770443,67.9419525065963,12.9260672442384,26.4984378506887,12.0364060453372,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5256390","Oral administration/gavage",0.03,"Locomotor activity",7.74,"TAAR1 full agonist","High",218.29,0.018,2.03275644876186,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

However, the underlying action mechanism of SEP-856 remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying mechanisms of SEP-856 on SZ-like behavior in a perinatal MK-801 treatment combined with social isolation from the weaning to adulthood model (MK-SI). First, we created an animal model that resembles SZ that combines the perinatal MK-801 with social isolation from weaning to adulthood. Then, different classical behavioral tests were used to evaluate the antipsychotic properties of SEP-856. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781","12/11/2024 10:23","62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Yes","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","No","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)","Neurodevelopmental (e.g. MAM, post-weaning isolation, MIA)",NA,"MK-801","0.3","miligrams (mg) per kg","post-weaning isolation","Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection","35",NA,NA,"10",NA,"miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"After disease model induction",NA,"14",NA,"Days",NA,NA,NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,"Multiple doses (enter details in comments)",NA,"36",NA,"Days",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Male","WT","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Exact number","999","56","0","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Other (enter in comments)","Yes","07/03/2025 13:49","128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","PPI - 93","02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff","49ccfefc-0121-40d4-a5e4-0cc8a9161624","15","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","FALSE","dual hit","FALSE",NA,"811df00b-3b54-4c79-811f-1139c3eec94f",NA,"Simple intervention","SEP‐363856 10",NA,"Intervention",NA,"FALSE","1","0.78","Mean","%","0.04","SEM","5ec13944-5c99-413f-9070-795ea2a21e98.128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7.02f454a9-85e1-42d3-8230-e916bcc875ff.1","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","SEP-363856","SEP-363856","SEP-363856, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","SEP-363856, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"SEP-363856",NA,"SEP-363856, 10 miligrams (mg) per kg","SEP-363856","5ec13944-5c99-413f-9070-795ea2a21e98","SEP-363856 exerts neuroprotection through the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway in a dual-hit neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia-like mice.","Li M",NA,NA,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a serious, destructive neurodevelopmental disorder.

The levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β), apoptosis-related genes (Bax and Bcl-2), and synaptic plasticity-related genes (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] and PSD-95) in the hippocampus were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining were used to observe the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal DG subregions. Western blot was performed to detect the protein expression levels of BDNF, PSD-95, Bax, Bcl-2, PI3K, p-PI3K, AKT, p-AKT, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in the hippocampus. MK-SI neurodevelopmental disease model studies have shown that compared with sham group, MK-SI group exhibit higher levels of autonomic activity, stereotyped behaviors, withdrawal from social interactions, dysregulated sensorimotor gating, and impaired recognition and spatial memory. These findings imply that the MK-SI model can mimic symptoms similar to those of SZ. Compared with the MK-SI model, high doses of SEP-856 all significantly reduced increased activity, improved social interaction, reduced stereotyping behavior, reversed sensorimotor gating dysregulation, and improved recognition memory and spatial memory impairment in MK-SI mice. In addition, SEP-856 can reduce the release of proinflammatory factors in the MK-SI model, promote the expression of BDNF and PSD-95 in the hippocampus, correct the Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, turn on the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling pathway, and ultimately help the MK-SI mice's behavioral abnormalities. SEP-856 may play an antipsychotic role in MK-SI ""dual-hit"" model-induced SZ-like behavior mice by promoting synaptic plasticity recovery, decreasing death of hippocampal neurons, lowering the production of pro-inflammatory substances in the hippocampal region, and subsequently initiating the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β signaling cascade.",NA,NA,"2024","10.1002/ddr.22225",NA,NA,NA,"pubmed-38879781","12/11/2024 10:23","62c1ec5f-a152-4634-8f35-c06ef2372772","LSR3_update_08112024","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","FALSE","TRUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,14,NA,"Days",NA,"No treatment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (other related to psychosis), e.g. positive/negative/cognitive/depression","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","14","Days","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Exact number","999","56","0","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Other (enter in comments)","Yes","07/03/2025 13:49","128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7","all together","OFT - average speed","Locomotor activity","4f59a19d-b726-4643-857a-40b7e3cc0808","b88e0798-817f-4ed7-96ce-8f899b7505e9","15","6157e4be-aa04-4336-bc3a-48a1698bd5e7","TRUE",NA,"TRUE",NA,"983684ef-5704-4271-be43-4e1fc60c8a03",NA,"Sham","vehicle",NA,"Negative control",NA,"TRUE","1","17.8","Mean","cm/s","1","SEM","5ec13944-5c99-413f-9070-795ea2a21e98.128ff9f7-cc8a-46d9-923f-cd1d4f9be3e7.4f59a19d-b726-4643-857a-40b7e3cc0808.1",NA,"S","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP-363856, 10 mg/kg","TvC","Pharmacological","model - control",15,24.3,1.9,7.35866835779409,"model - 10",15,19.3,2.3,8.90786169627706,"sham - control",15,17.8,1,3.87298334620742,TRUE,0.595424784794309,0.139242177905789,76.9230769230769,113.210282427601,137.04402609657,45.8967196620809,NA,NA,"Therapeutic","Mouse","Not stated (mouse)","Male","SEP-363856","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",10,"Locomotor activity",6.85,"TAAR1 full agonist","Low (5HT1A partial agonism)",183.27,0.14,5.96549275301923,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",12,"D: 12-15 criteria met"

THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE.

Here, we tested in rats the ability of ro5203648, a selective taar1 partial agonist, to modulate the physiological and behavioral effects of methamphetamine (meth). In experiment 1, ro5203468 dose- and time-dependently altered meth-induced locomotor activity, manifested as an early attenuation followed by a late potentiation of meth's stimulating effects. In experiment 2, rats received a 14-day treatment regimen during which ro5203648 was co-administered with meth. Ro5203648 dose-dependently attenuated meth-stimulated hyperactivity, with the effects becoming more apparent as the treatments progressed. After chronic exposure and 3-day withdrawal, rats were tested for locomotor sensitization. Ro5203648 administration during the sensitizing phase prevented the development of meth sensitization. However, ro5203648, at the high dose, cross-sensitized with meth. In experiment 3, ro5203648 dose-dependently blocked meth self-administration without affecting operant responding maintained by sucrose, and exhibited lack of reinforcing efficacy when tested as a meth's substitute. Neurochemical data showed that ro5203648 did not affect meth-mediated da efflux and uptake inhibition in striatal synaptosomes.

Antipsychotic drugs are thought to re-balance this output by blocking D2 receptors (D2Rs). In this study, we found that amphetamine-driven dopamine release unbalanced D1-SPN and D2-SPN Ca(2+) activity in mice, but that antipsychotic efficacy was associated with the reversal of abnormal D1-SPN, rather than D2-SPN, dynamics, even for drugs that are D2R selective or lacking any dopamine receptor affinity. By contrast, a clinically ineffective drug normalized D2-SPN dynamics but exacerbated D1-SPN dynamics under hyperdopaminergic conditions. Consistent with antipsychotic effect, selective D1-SPN inhibition attenuated amphetamine-driven changes in locomotion, sensorimotor gating and hallucination-like perception.

Due to a non-negligible structural similarity with endogenous ligands, most of the agonists developed so far resulted in being affected by a low selectivity for TAAR1 with respect to other monoaminergic G protein-coupled receptors, like the adrenoreceptors. This study utilized comparative molecular docking studies and quantitative–structure activity relationship (QSAR) analyses to unveil key structural differences between TAAR1 and alpha2-adrenoreceptor (α2-ADR), with the aim to design novel TAAR1 agonists characterized by a higher selectivity profile and reduced off-target effects. While the presence of hydrophobic motives is encouraged towards both the two receptors, the introduction of polar/positively charged groups and the ligand conformation deeply affect the TAAR1 or α2-ADR putative selectivity. These computational methods allowed the identification of the α2A-ADR agonist guanfacine as an attractive TAAR1-targeting lead compound, demonstrating nanomolar activity in vitro.

THE MECHANISM UNDERLYING THIS IS UNCLEAR BUT MAY BE DUE TO N-METHYL-D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR (NMDAR) HYPOFUNCTION AND PARVALBUMIN (PV) NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION LEADING TO DISINHIBITION OF MESOSTRIATAL DOPAMINE NEURONS. HERE, WE DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL MOUSE MODEL OF THE DOPAMINE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY SEEN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA AND TEST APPROACHES TO REVERSE THE DOPAMINE CHANGES. MICE WERE TREATED WITH SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE (30 MG/KG) OR SALINE AND THEN RECEIVED IN VIVO POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY OF STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY, ANALOGOUS TO MEASURES USED IN PATIENTS. LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED USING THE OPEN-FIELD TEST. IN VIVO CELL-TYPE-SPECIFIC CHEMOGENETIC APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE USED TO MANIPULATE NEURONAL EXCITABILITY. IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY AND RNA SEQUENCING WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE INCREASED STRIATAL DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY (COHEN’S D = 2.5) AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THESE EFFECTS WERE COUNTERED BY INHIBITION OF MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE NEURONS, AND BY ACTIVATION OF PV INTERNEURONS IN PRE-LIMBIC CORTEX AND VENTRAL SUBICULUM OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. SUB-CHRONIC KETAMINE REDUCED PV EXPRESSION IN THESE CORTICAL AND HIPPOCAMPAL REGIONS.

RESULTS: WE DISCOVERED TWO TAAR1 AGONISTS: COMPOUNDS 50A AND 50B.

Recently, several selective taar 1 ligands have been described to possess antipsychotic and antidepressant-like activities. However, it is unknown of the role of these ligands in modulating psychostimulant-induced neurobehavioral plasticity. This study examined the effects of a selective taar 1 agonist, ro5263397, on cocaine induced behavioral sensitization in rats, a rodent model of drug-induced behavioral plasticity. Daily treatment with 15. Mg/kg cocaine (i.p., 7 days) induced robust locomotor sensitization in rats. Ro5263397 (1-10. Mg/kg, i.p.) Alone did not significantly alter the locomotor activity. Acute treatment with ro5263397 (3.2 and 10. Mg/kg) did not significantly modify cocaine-induced hyperactivity:  however, the induction of locomotor sensitization was significantly blocked after 7 days of daily ro5263397 treatment. More importantly, the expression of locomotor sensitization remained significantly attenuated when rats were re-tested 7 days after the last drug treatment. The marked attenuation of cocaine sensitization was also evidenced by the suppression of the dose-effect function (3.2-32. Mg/kg) of cocaine sensitization. Together, these data represent the first to report a critical modulatory role of taar 1 agonists in cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity, which may be indicative of its potential role for altering other long-lasting behavioral maladaptations of cocaine including drug addiction. © 2014 elsevier ireland ltd.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84896090771&doi=10.1016%2fj.neulet.2014.02.024&partnerID=40&md5=c9922f636007dfd20ecb3e17ae1baf90","Department Of Pharmacology And Toxicology, School Of Medicine And Biomedical Sciences, University At Buffalo, The State University Of New York, Buffalo, Ny 14214, United States:  Department Of Neurology, University Hospital Of Hubei University For Nationalities, Enshi, Hubei 445000, China:  Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, Nc 27709, United States","2014","10.1016/j.neulet.2014.02.024","article","animals:central nervous system stimulants:cocaine:cocaine-related disorders:dose-response relationship, drug:male:motor activity:rats, sprague-dawley:receptors, g-protein-coupled:behavioral sensitization:cocaine:rats:taar 1:amine:drugs used in the treatment of addiction:ro 5263397:trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist:unclassified drug:acute drug administration:animal experiment:animal model:article:chronic drug administration:cocaine dependence:controlled study:dose response:hyperactivity:locomotion:male:nerve cell plasticity:nonhuman:priority journal:rat:research:rodent model:sensitization",NA,NA,"16/02/2024 11:26","3201c55a-8aa2-4990-96da-99ea8dab451a","150224_SOLES_update","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","Unclear","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","No","NA (ethical approval declared)","Yes","Yes","No","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,NA,"cocaine","15","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,"3.2",NA,"miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Prior to disease model induction",NA,"7",NA,"Days",NA,NA,NA,"Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,"Single dose",NA,"-0.33",NA,"Hours",NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","20","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","TRUE","Male","WT","Rat","Sprague-dawley (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)","7","999","999","999","999","Days","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","No","07/03/2025 09:48","1cd24dc3-3d6a-442a-8948-862836be1cbe","Fig2","Loc60","06fee2ca-c3d8-4d24-b307-41eae1bad95a","5357075a-9182-4e36-b756-454e3cb29eec","7","0eab0af9-4767-4ac3-954b-aefdc51073ac","FALSE","cocaine 15","FALSE",NA,"8d78fa23-81cd-4f21-ad65-1b85f4adbb5c",NA,"Simple intervention","RO5263397 3.2",NA,"Intervention",NA,"TRUE","1","241","Mean","locomotion counts in 60 min","33.5","SD","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068.1cd24dc3-3d6a-442a-8948-862836be1cbe.06fee2ca-c3d8-4d24-b307-41eae1bad95a.1","Simple intervention (T v Cont)","I","RO5263397","RO5263397","RO5263397, 3.2 miligrams (mg) per kg","Other, NA NA","RO5263397, 3.2 miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"RO5263397",NA,"RO5263397, 3.2 miligrams (mg) per kg","RO5263397","0ec35b74-40b5-48e9-8c38-3eda2e3f2068","The trace amine associated receptor 1 agonist ro5263397 attenuates the induction of cocaine behavioral sensitization in rats","Thorn Da : Zhang C : Zhang Y : Li J-X","Neuroscience Letters",NA,"The trace amine associated receptor (taar) 1 is a new g protein coupled receptor that critically modulates central dopaminergic system.

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068","31/08/2023 13:56","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,NA,"cocaine","20","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","60","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Exact number","8","999","999","999","999","Weeks","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","No","01/01/2024 14:08","ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7","Fig 1d","LMA - C, P - Olanz","48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a","edd38bdd-009c-41cb-8d65-7b9812bb5d2d","8","34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc","FALSE","cocaine",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Negative control",NA,NA,NA,NA,"FALSE","1","0","Mean","% inhibition","12.3","SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7.48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a.1",NA,"C","Other","Other","Other, NA NA","Other, NA NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368","A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: TAAR1 AGONISTS REVEAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY, IMPROVE COGNITION AND CONTROL BODY WEIGHT","REVEL FG :MOREAU J-L :POUZET B :MORY R :BRADAIA A :BUCHY D :METZLER V :CHABOZ S :GROEBKE ZBINDEN K :GALLEY G :NORCROSS RD :TUERCK D :BRUNS A :MORAIRTY SR :KILDUFF TS :WALLACE TL :RISTERUCCI C :WETTSTEIN JG :HOENER MC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Not reported",NA,"Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Locomotor activity",NA,NA,NA,"34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5256390, 0.1 mg/kg","TvC","Pharmacological","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0",8,0,12.3,34.7896536343781,"Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,47,15,42.4264068711929,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,1.14517153432495,0.29098180759463,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5256390","Oral administration/gavage",0.1,"Locomotor activity",7.74,"TAAR1 full agonist","High",218.29,0.018,3.23672925308779,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

TO DECIPHER THE BRAIN FUNCTIONS OF TAAR1, A SELECTIVE TAAR1 AGONIST, RO5166017, WAS ENGINEERED. RO5166017 SHOWED HIGH AFFINITY AND POTENT FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITY AT MOUSE, RAT, CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY, AND HUMAN TAAR1 STABLY EXPRESSED IN HEK293 CELLS AS WELL AS HIGH SELECTIVITY VS. OTHER TARGETS. IN MOUSE BRAIN SLICES, RO5166017 INHIBITED THE FIRING FREQUENCY OF DOPAMINERGIC AND SEROTONERGIC NEURONS IN REGIONS WHERE TAAR1 IS EXPRESSED (I.E., THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA AND DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS, RESPECTIVELY).

DRUG DEVELOPMENT OF NON-D2 COMPOUNDS, SEEKING TO AVOID THE LIMITING SIDE EFFECTS OF DOPAMINE RECEPTOR BLOCKADE, HAS FAILED TO DATE TO YIELD NEW MEDICINES FOR PATIENTS. IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS.

IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT THE DISCOVERY OF SEP-363856 (SEP-856), A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WITH A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION. SEP-856 WAS DISCOVERED IN A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY EFFORT UTILIZING A HIGH THROUGHPUT, HIGH CONTENT, MOUSE-BEHAVIOR PHENOTYPING PLATFORM, IN COMBINATION WITH IN VITRO SCREENING, AIMED AT DEVELOPING NON-D2 (ANTI-TARGET) COMPOUNDS THAT COULD NEVERTHELESS RETAIN EFFICACY ACROSS MULTIPLE ANIMAL MODELS SENSITIVE TO D2-BASED PHARMACOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS.

IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS CAUSED BY OLANZAPINE, OTHER DRUGS WITH DIFFERENT TARGETS WERE SELECTED FOR COMBINED USE AND EVALUATED IN ANIMAL MODELS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEP-363856 IS A NOVEL PSYCHOTROPIC AGENT WHICH IS UNDER PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER CO-ADMINISTRATION OF OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 EXERTS SYNERGISTIC ANTI-SCHIZOPHRENIC EFFECTS IN THE APOMORPHINE (APO)-INDUCED CLIMBING TEST, THE MK-801-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY TEST, AND THE MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, AND THEREFORE REDUCES THE WEIGHT GAIN SIDE EFFECTS INDUCED BY OLANZAPINE. THROUGH ISOBOLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS SHOWED A SYNERGISTIC INTERACTION IN THE CLIMBING TEST: THE EXPERIMENTAL ED30 (3 MG/KG) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER (P < 0.05) THAN THE THEORETICAL ED30 (5 MG/KG). ADDITIONALLY, SUCH POTENTIATING EFFECTS APPEARED ADDITIVE IN THE MK-801 CHALLENGE EXPERIMENT. CO-TREATMENT WITH AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF OLANZAPINE AND A LOW DOSE OF SEP-363856 REVERSED MK-801-INDUCED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT SYMPTOMS IN MICE. MOREOVER, COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH OLANZAPINE AND SEP-363856 CONTROLS SUSTAINED WEIGHT GAIN IN MICE WITH CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO OLANZAPINE.

IN ADDITION, ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENTS TRIGGER SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS THAT PRECIPITATE TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION. HERE, WE SHOW THAT ACTIVATION OF THE TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 (TAAR1), A MODULATOR OF MONOAMINERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION, REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC OPTION. IN RODENTS, ACTIVATION OF TAAR1 BY TWO NOVEL AND PHARMACOLOGICALLY DISTINCT COMPOUNDS, THE FULL AGONIST RO5256390 AND THE PARTIAL AGONIST RO5263397, BLOCKS PSYCHOSTIMULANT-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY AND PRODUCES A BRAIN ACTIVATION PATTERN REMINISCENT OF THE ANTIPSYCHOTIC DRUG OLANZAPINE, SUGGESTING ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE PROPERTIES.

SEP-856 DEMONSTRATED BROAD EFFICACY IN PUTATIVE RODENT MODELS RELATING TO ASPECTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, INCLUDING PHENCYCLIDINE (PCP)-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY, PREPULSE INHIBITION, AND PCP-INDUCED DEFICITS IN SOCIAL INTERACTION. IN ADDITION TO ITS FAVORABLE PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES, LACK OF D2 RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY, AND THE ABSENCE OF CATALEPSY, SEP-856’S BROAD PROFILE WAS FURTHER HIGHLIGHTED BY ITS ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF RAPID EYE MOVEMENT SLEEP IN RATS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISM OF ACTION HAS NOT BEEN FULLY ELUCIDATED, IN VITRO AND IN VIVO PHARMACOLOGY DATA AS WELL AS SLICE AND IN VIVO ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY RECORDINGS SUGGEST THAT AGONISM AT BOTH TRACE AMINE-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1 AND 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IS INTEGRAL TO ITS EFFICACY. BASED ON THE PRECLINICAL DATA AND ITS UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, SEP-856 IS A PROMISING NEW AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND REPRESENTS A NEW PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASS EXPECTED TO LACK THE SIDE EFFECTS STEMMING FROM BLOCKADE OF D2 SIGNALING.

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068","31/08/2023 13:56","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,NA,"cocaine","20","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Positive control (e.g. licensed antipsychotics)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.3",NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","60","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Exact number","8","999","999","999","999","Weeks","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","No","01/01/2024 14:08","ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7","Fig 1d","LMA - C, P - Olanz","48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a","a7873d79-bb6d-4bdc-bb18-00cb884ea763","8","34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc","FALSE","cocaine","TRUE",NA,"e2572d6e-921c-4871-ae3b-0a78ad806030",NA,"Positive control","olanzepine 0.3mg/kg",NA,"Positive control",NA,"FALSE","1","61.1","Mean","% inhibition","16.9","SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.ddd4927e-abfa-4e48-893e-fa3193a706a7.48171525-ef26-43a3-82b0-a2490888685a.1","Antipsychotic drug (A v Cont)","C","olanzapine","olanzapine","olanzapine, NA NA","Other, NA NA","olanzapine, 0.3 mg/kg",NA,"olanzapine",NA,"olanzapine, 0.3 mg/kg","olanzapine","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368","A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: TAAR1 AGONISTS REVEAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY, IMPROVE COGNITION AND CONTROL BODY WEIGHT","REVEL FG :MOREAU J-L :POUZET B :MORY R :BRADAIA A :BUCHY D :METZLER V :CHABOZ S :GROEBKE ZBINDEN K :GALLEY G :NORCROSS RD :TUERCK D :BRUNS A :MORAIRTY SR :KILDUFF TS :WALLACE TL :RISTERUCCI C :WETTSTEIN JG :HOENER MC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Not reported",NA,"Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Locomotor activity",NA,NA,NA,"34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5256390, 0.1 mg/kg v. olanzapine, 0.3 mg/kg","TvA","Pharmacological","Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0.3 90 0",8,61.1,16.9,47.8004184082106,"Fig 1d Coc Ag Ol 0 90 0.1",8,47,15,42.4264068711929,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,-0.294922888932876,0.252718109700516,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5256390","Oral administration/gavage",0.1,"Locomotor activity",7.74,"TAAR1 full agonist","High",218.29,0.018,3.23672925308779,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"

THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY PROVIDE A NOVEL AND DIFFERENTIATED TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AS COMPARED WITH CURRENT MEDICATION STANDARDS: TAAR1 AGONISTS MAY IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE POSITIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ALSO THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS, WITHOUT CAUSING ADVERSE EFFECTS SUCH AS MOTOR IMPAIRMENTS OR WEIGHT GAIN. © 2013 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876681068&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2012.57&partnerID=40&md5=4973f702bbf24405022531db535afcf9","United Kingdom","2013","10.1038/mp.2012.57","ARTICLE","ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE:ANIMALS:ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENTS:ATTENTION:BENZODIAZEPINES:BODY WEIGHT:COCAINE:CONDITIONING, OPERANT:DEPRESSION:DISEASE MODELS, ANIMAL:DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS:ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY:HALLUCINOGENS:HALOPERIDOL:HUMANS:MACACA FASCICULARIS:MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:MALE:MENTAL RECALL:MICE:MICE, INBRED C57BL:MICE, TRANSGENIC:MICROINJECTIONS:MOTOR ACTIVITY:MUTATION:OOCYTES:OXAZOLES:PHENCYCLIDINE:PHENETHYLAMINES:PROTEIN BINDING:PYRROLIDINONES:RATS:RATS, WISTAR:RECEPTORS, G-PROTEIN-COUPLED:REINFORCEMENT (PSYCHOLOGY):SCHIZOPHRENIA:SWIMMING:TELEMETRY:TRITIUM:XENOPUS:2 (2 PHENYL BUTYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:4 (3 FLUORO 2 METHYL PHENYL) 4,5 DIHYDRO OXAZOL 2 YLAMINE:ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENT:BETA GALACTOSIDASE:CYCLIC AMP:HALOPERIDOL:NEUROLEPTIC AGENT:OLANZAPINE:PROTEIN:RO 5256390:RO 5263397:TRACE AMINE ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR 1:UNCLASSIFIED DRUG:ANIMAL EXPERIMENT:ANIMAL TISSUE:ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY:AREA UNDER THE CURVE:ARTICLE:BODY WEIGHT:CATALEPSY:COGNITION:CONTROLLED STUDY:DRUG BLOOD LEVEL:DRUG BRAIN LEVEL:DRUG CLEARANCE:DRUG EFFICACY:DRUG HALF LIFE:DRUG POTENTIATION:DRUG RECEPTOR BINDING:HUMAN:HUMAN CELL:LOCOMOTION:MALE:MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:NONHUMAN:NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING:PRIORITY JOURNAL:RAT:SCHIZOPHRENIA:TIME TO MAXIMUM PLASMA CONCENTRATION:WEIGHT GAIN",NA,"2-S2.0-84876681068","31/08/2023 13:56","f590804d-c974-4d28-94bb-871eb3941c6a","LSR3_SyRF_upload","FALSE","a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a","Malcolm Macleod","Animal","None specified","FALSE","TRUE","Pharmacological (e.g. psychostimulants, NMDA antagonists)",NA,NA,"cocaine","20","miligrams (mg) per kg",NA,"Post-weaning","Intraperitoneal (IP) injection",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Positive control (e.g. licensed antipsychotics)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0.03",NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment","<3 weeks after intervention (longest possible)","999","Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous","FALSE","Not reported","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Exact number","999","999","999","999","999","Weeks","Weight not reported","999","999","999","999","Grams (g)","No","01/01/2024 14:08","92e2e6e1-2b36-4a83-8c97-218529537e64","risperidone S2","LMA - C,P - Resp","7f4af976-288c-4bb8-8dda-fbebb9ed416d","839d08cd-b3db-4b1c-b58e-55539b57a2d0","8","34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc","FALSE","cocaine","TRUE",NA,"cac2de46-c491-49c0-a9a9-8706312270ef",NA,"Positive control","risperidone 0.03mg/kg",NA,"Positive control",NA,"FALSE","1","46.3","Mean","% inhibition","7.6","SEM","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368.92e2e6e1-2b36-4a83-8c97-218529537e64.7f4af976-288c-4bb8-8dda-fbebb9ed416d.1","Antipsychotic drug (A v Cont)","C","risperidone","risperidone","risperidone, NA NA","Other, NA NA","risperidone, 0.03 mg/kg",NA,"risperidone",NA,"risperidone, 0.03 mg/kg","risperidone","4f31dcd6-e041-4882-acc8-dbf3ccfd2368","A NEW PERSPECTIVE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: TAAR1 AGONISTS REVEAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC- AND ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY, IMPROVE COGNITION AND CONTROL BODY WEIGHT","REVEL FG :MOREAU J-L :POUZET B :MORY R :BRADAIA A :BUCHY D :METZLER V :CHABOZ S :GROEBKE ZBINDEN K :GALLEY G :NORCROSS RD :TUERCK D :BRUNS A :MORAIRTY SR :KILDUFF TS :WALLACE TL :RISTERUCCI C :WETTSTEIN JG :HOENER MC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mg/kg","mg/kg",NA,NA,999,NA,"Single dose",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Behavioural (primary): locomotor hyperactivity, PPI impairment",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Not reported",NA,"Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Locomotor activity",NA,NA,NA,"34b704c1-1e1b-48c5-9dd3-a765aa7d64bc",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"FALSE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"RO5263397, 0.01 mg/kg & risperidone, 0.03 mg/kg v. risperidone, 0.03 mg/kg","TAvA","Pharmacological","S2 Risp 0.03 97 0",8,46.3,7.6,21.496046148071,"S2 Risp 0.03 97 0.01",8,67.1,9.2,26.0215295476649,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,0.823839033609882,0.271209711040602,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6J (mouse)","Not reported","RO5263397","Oral administration/gavage",0.01,"Locomotor activity",7.77,"TAAR1 partial agonist","High",194.21,0.017,1.10818698008261,0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",10,"C: 8-11 criteria met"
